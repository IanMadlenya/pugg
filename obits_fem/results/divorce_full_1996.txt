         Evelyn Laye, a British musical comedy star whose 80-year career included appearances on Broadway, died on Saturday at a nursing home in London. She was 95.         Miss Laye made her stage debut at the age of 15 and enjoyed her first big success in "The Merry Widow" in 1923. She became an international star when she  played the lead in the 1929 Broadway production of Noel Coward's "Bitter Sweet," singing "I'll See You Again," which became her signature.         She also appeared in films, among them "The Night is Young" (1934), "Evensong" (1934), "Make Mine a Million" (1959), "Theater of Death" (1966), "Say Hello to Yesterday" (1970) and "Second Star to the Right" (1980).         In 1992 she made a farewell tour in Britain and was honored in a gala at the  London Palladium.         Her marriage to Sonnie Hale, an actor, ended in divorce. Her second husband,  Frank Lawton, an actor, died in 1969.       
         Marie-Helene de Rothschild, one of Europe's most imaginative hostesses, whose activities were a major part of the Paris social season for many years, died on  Friday at her home in Ferrieres, 20 miles northeast of Paris. She was 65 and had suffered for three decades from an incurable degenerative arthritic ailment.         Baroness de Rothschild, whose husband, Baron Guy de Rothschild, is dean of the French branch of the banking family, was well known in the world of fashion  and was particularly renowned for the dinners, balls and benefits she organized. Many were held at Chateau Ferrieres, the former Rothschild mansion that now belongs to the French state. The house in which the Baroness died was built on the estate after the chateau had been given to the Government.         The Baroness, who enjoyed creating fantasies for her social occasions, once  greeted 150 guests at a dinner (Diner de Tetes Surrealistes, whose invitations had to be read in a mirror) dressed as a stag at the kill, with a mask of towering antlers and pear-shaped diamond "tears" on her face.         At a ball she gave at Ferrieres for 1,600 people, the chateau was covered in  white muslin to make it look like a huge diamond-studded cobweb. A gala for the  Paris Ballet transformed the Palais Garnier into a woodland, with trees and vines climbing to the ceiling. At another function, her Bal Proust, celebrating  the 100th anniversary of Marcel Proust's birth, Cecil Beaton took guests' photographic portraits.         "When she has made up her mind about something, there is nothing on earth that can deter her," her husband once said.         The daughter of Baron Egmont van Zuylen de Nyevelt de Haar, a Dutch diplomat, and an Egyptian mother, the Baroness was educated at Marymount College in New York.         On a trip to Paris shortly after leaving school, she met and married Count Francois de Nicolay. They were divorced six years later after she had met Baron  de Rothschild and he, too, had decided to obtain a divorce. The Rothschilds were married in 1957 in a civil ceremony in New York -- "to allow the tempest we had  stirred up by a double divorce to subside a little," the Baroness once recalled.         After Ferrieres was donated to the Government, the Baroness did most of her entertaining at her Paris residence, the 18th-century Hotel Lambert on Ile St.-Louis. Her guests included a cross-section of international society, business and the arts -- the Duchess of Windsor, Princess Grace, Elizabeth Taylor, Yves Saint Laurent, Oscar de la Renta and Andy Warhol.         "A good way of making people happy is to allow them to meet their opposites," she once said.         Nan Kempner, a New York socialite and a longtime friend, said, "She had enormous intelligence and curiosity and she wanted to see and do everything."         When France nationalized Banque Rothschild in 1981, the Baron moved to New York for a short time. Although the Baroness's illness made traveling difficult, she worked with an interior decorator on refurbishing their Upper East Side apartment.         The Baroness was also a major supporter of French couture and for many years  was in the front row at important shows. She was president of the committee that organized the 1973 Divertissement a Versailles, an event at which American designers were not only introduced to Europeans but also upstaged their French counterparts.         Survivors include her husband; two sons, Philippe de Nicolay, and Edouard de  Rothschild of Paris; a stepson, David de Rothschild of Paris, and a brother, Teddy van Zuylen of London.       
         Anne McDonnell Ford Johnson, who served on the White House Fine Arts Committee during the Eisenhower and Kennedy administrations, helped restore Blair House in Washington and played an active role in social and charitable events in New York, died Friday at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. She was 76.         Her death was due to complications from a stroke, her daughter Charlotte Ford said.         Mrs. Johnson was divorced from the late Henry Ford 2d, the chairman of the Ford Motor Company, in 1964. She married Deane F. Johnson, a prominent Los Angeles lawyer, in 1968 and the couple moved to New York in 1980.         One of 14 children in the prominent New York family of James F. McDonnell, Mrs. Johnson was born in Rye, N.Y., and grew up in a duplex apartment in Manhattan and on the 55-acre family estate in Southampton. Her grandfather, Thomas E. Murray, was a utilities executive and inventor.         Mrs. Johnson attended the Convent of the Sacred Heart in Noroton, Conn., and  the Grattanelli School in Sienna, Italy. She met Mr. Ford while returning from a European trip in 1936, and they were married in 1940 in what was a major event of the Southampton social season. The service was conducted by the Most Rev. Fulton J. Sheen, then a monsignor, who had instructed Mr. Ford in Roman Catholicism before his conversion.         During her years in Grosse Pointe, Mich., she was active in the support of the Detroit Institute of Art and the Metropolitan Opera Association of Detroit. She was also one of the first women elected to the board of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In 1956, she was selected as one of the 10 best-dressed women in the world and four years later was named to the Fashion Hall of Fame.         The announcement of the Ford separation and divorce followed months of rumor  in which Mr. Ford was linked romantically to the Italian-born Maria Cristina Vettore Austin, the divorced wife of a British naval officer. Mr. Ford and Mrs.  Austin were married in 1965.         Shortly after her divorce, Mrs. Ford, who had moved to Manhattan, was with a  friend having a cup of espresso at the Regency Hotel. She noticed Mrs. Austin, who was with a friend at another table. "This had to happen some time," she whispered to her companion. "I think the only gracious thing is to go over and say hello. You know I've never met her." The two went over, introduced themselves and shook hands. Mrs. Ford's friend later reported: "It was all very  civilized, but if there were a way to bottle up the electricity in that little room, it would run the Ford industries for a solid year."         After her marriage to Mr. Johnson, to whom she was introduced by Rocky Converse, the widow of Gary Cooper, Mrs. Johnson created an instant status revolution in Los Angeles, where she immediately became the most prestigious hostess. The couple bought a Regency-style house that Mrs. Johnson, who was known as a connoisseur of French furniture, filled with the pieces she had collected. She eventually became the Los Angeles representative of Christie's, the international auction house. Later, in New York, she was associated for a time with Sotheby's.         Survivors include Mr. Johnson, two daughters, Charlotte Ford of Manhattan and Anne Ford of Southampton and Manhattan; a son, Edsel B. Ford 2d of Grosse Pointe; five sisters, Katherine Sullivan of Arizona, Mary Murnane and Margie Murphy of Florida, Barbara Hennessey of Connecticut and Sheila Collins of California; two brothers, Morgan McDonnell of Chicago and Jim McDonnell of Detroit, seven grandchildren and one great-grandchild.       
         Barbara McLean, an Oscar-winning Hollywood film editor whose influence at 20th Century-Fox extended far beyond the cutting room, died on March 28 at a convalescent home in Newport Beach, Calif. She was 92 and had lived in Newport Beach since her retirement in 1969 after 20 years as head of the studio's editing division.         One of the first women to work as a film editor in Hollywood, Miss McLean, who began as an assistant in the 1920's and cut her first movie, "Gallant Lady," in 1933, knew her place:         For decades it was in the chair next to Darryl F. Zanuck, the Fox studio chief, who relied so much on the judgment of the woman he called Bobby that he rarely made a major decision on anything from costumes to casting without consulting her first.         And when he did, arguments tended to cease. Studio executives knew that when  Mr. Zanuck prefaced a statement with "Bobby says . . . ," he wasn't expressing an opinion but announcing a decision.         There was the time in 1936, for example, when Mr. Zanuck and other executives were watching screen tests, trying to decide between two actors for a leading role. When the projection room lights went up, Mr. Zanuck turned to Miss McLean  as usual, and as usual she didn't disappoint: Don Ameche was good, she said, but the other fellow looked more dashing in the movie's costumes.         "Bobby says . . . ," said Mr. Zanuck, and Tyrone Power got the part in "LLoyd's of London" that made him a star.         Miss McLean, whose scores of credits included "All About Eve," "12 O'Clock High," "The Robe" and "Tobacco Road," won an Academy Award in 1944 for her work  on the documentary "Wilson," a biography of Woodrow Wilson.         But for all her undisputed skills, Miss McLean had to break through entrenched sexual stereotypes to get a job in the first place.         Although other women worked as editors in the 1930's, including Dorothy Spencers, Marjorie Fowler, Margaret Booth and Ada Warren, editing was considered man's work.         In the division of Hollywood labor, women might work as actresses, seamstresses, secretaries or even film lab technicians, where their nimble fingers were even deemed to give them an advantage in the delicate task of cutting and splicing film to a male editor's specifications.         Miss McLean's fingers were as nimble as anyone's, and no wonder. She had been cutting and splicing since she was a teen-ager working in the film lab that her  father, Charles Pollut, operated near the family's home in Palisades Park, N.J.         After she married Gordon McLean, a projectionist, the couple went to Hollywood in 1924. Miss McLean found work as a film technician, then worked as an assistant editor for a number of studios, and in the early 1930's began the long association with Mr. Zanuck, who inevitably selected her to edit his personal productions at Fox.         Miss McLean, whose early marriage ended in divorce, married the director Robert Webb in 1951 after working with him on the movie "David and Bathsheba." Mr. Webb died several years ago.         She is survived by a stepson, James Webb, of Payson, Ariz.       
         Greer Garson, the actress who epitomized a noble, wise and courageous wife in some of the sleekest and most sentimental American movies of the 1940's, died yesterday morning at Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas. She was 92.         Miss Garson, who had a history of heart problems, had lived at the long-term-care hospital for the last three years, according to Ann Harper, a spokeswoman at the hospital.         Miss Garson became an instant success as a captivating young wife in the sentimental 1939 film "Goodbye, Mr. Chips." She was nominated for an Academy Award for this first film performance and quickly became one of the 10 most popular Hollywood stars.         She received five more Oscar nominations in five years for self-sacrificing portrayals in "Blossoms in the Dust" (1941), "Mrs. Miniver" (1942), "Madame Curie" (1943), "Mrs. Parkington" (1944) and "The Valley of Decision" (1945). She won the best actress Oscar for "Mrs. Miniver," in which she superbly symbolized  the spirit and virtue of a British homemaker in wartime.         With much of the earth ravaged by World War II, the Scotch-Irish actress with titian hair, blue-green eyes and alabaster complexion filled a need for a dignified and intrepid wife-mother figure. Her portrayals were so proper that one sequence in "Random Harvest," a major dramatic hit of 1942, created a sensation when she was allowed to wear kilts and show her shapely legs. Otherwise, she was heavily costumed and wholesomely typecast by Louis B. Mayer.         After the war, because of inferior vehicles and changing tastes, she was unable to escape the mold.         Nonetheless, in her Broadway debut in 1958, Miss Garson won acclaim in a comedy, succeeding Rosalind Russell as the devil-may-care "Auntie Mame." Two years later, Miss Garson received a seventh Oscar nomination for her portrayal of Eleanor Roosevelt in the film "Sunrise at Campobello."         While preparing for "Auntie Mame" she told an interviewer: "I'm tired of playing four-handkerchief heroines in crinoline roles. I think there's a little  bit of 'Auntie Mame' in every woman -- a kind of counterpart to the 'Walter Mitty' in every man. I think Mrs. Miniver and Auntie Mame would have gotten along real well. Mame's really a doll. She promoted a liveliness and kindliness, and isn't that the best one can do?"         Early on, the actress enjoyed peerless popularity. Nine of her first 11 movies opened at Radio City Music Hall and played at that premier movie palace a total of 64 weeks. In 1978, Vincent Canby of The New York Times offered a tribute in which he deemed Miss Garson "emblematic of everything the Music Hall offered its patrons."         "In her high-toned M-G-M pictures she was invariably serene, polite, elegant  in a slightly unreal way, too good to be true, always prepared to meet any emergency and staunchly middle-class," Mr. Canby continued. "Her pictures were neither inhibited by the Hall nor did they ever look tacky amid all that splendor. Actress and theater were one."         Greer Garson was born on Sept. 29, 1903, in County Down, Northern Ireland, of Presbyterian parents. Her father, George Garson, a businessman, died soon after, and she and her mother, Nina, moved to London. The name Greer was a contraction  of MacGregor, her mother's ancestral name.         She was a frail girl with chronic bronchitis who was comfortable with her many adult relatives but uneasy with people her own age. She recalled a childhood of scrimping, study and an abiding ambition to act despite her family's pressure on her to teach. She received full scholarships from a county  school and from the University of London, where she won honors studying French and 18th-century literature in an accelerated course, with secretarial classes for a backup.         Miss Garson obtained a secure post as a market researcher for a London advertising firm, but gave it up to study acting with the Birmingham Repertory Theater during two years in the provinces, where she received increasingly         favorable notices.         She polished her craft during two years in the West End, starring in eight plays, including Shaw's "Too True to Be Good," and became one of Britain's ablest young stage actresses. Most of the plays were flops, but she was praised  for her talent, drive and professionalism. Envious associates dubbed her Ca-Reer Garson, a tag that trailed her to Hollywood.         In one theater audience in 1938 was the head of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Riveted  by her performance, Mayer persuaded her to sign a movie contract for an uncommonly high starting salary of $500 a week. She confirmed his faith by her performance in "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" and further confirmed her skill in an effervescent 1940 film version of Jane Austen's novel "Pride and Prejudice," co-starring Laurence Olivier.         Miss Garson then entered her wartime phase of idealized helpmates, appearing  regularly with Walter Pidgeon. She inherited the mantle of M-G-M's First Lady from Norma Shearer, who had retired, and was indelibly typecast as what she ironically called "Metro's Glorified Mrs."         Her postwar, mostly unsuccessful, movies included "Adventure" (1946), co-starring Clark Gable; "That Forsythe Woman" (1949), with Errol Flynn and Mr.  Pidgeon, and the cameo role of Calpurnia in "Julius Caesar" (1953). In later years, she co-produced several plays in New York, including "On Golden Pond."         Miss Garson's marriages to Edward A. A. Snelson, a British civil servant, and to Richard Ney, an actor 10 years her junior who had played her son in "Mrs. Miniver," ended in divorce. In 1949, she married E. E. (Buddy) Fogelson, an oil  developer and industrialist. The Fogelsons had homes in Dallas and Los Angeles and a ranch outside Santa Fe, N.M., where they were civic leaders. Mr. Fogelson  died in 1987.         The actress's recreations included raising cattle and domestic animals as well as gardening and fishing. She continued to support the performing arts, giving $10 million to Southern Methodist University in Dallas for the Greer Garson Theater, which opened in September 1992. Asked once if she missed Hollywood, she replied: "No. I have at long last learned to be interested in where I am."         She is survived by a stepson, Gayle D. Fogelson, of Dallas.

         Irma Badillo, an adviser to Governors Mario M. Cuomo and Hugh L. Carey, died  yesterday at the Cabrini Hospital Hospice in Manhattan. Mrs. Badillo, who lived  in the Riverdale section of the Bronx until she was transferred to the hospice this month, was 72.         She had suffered from Alzheimer's disease for several years, and could not walk or talk for the last year, said her husband, Herman, a mayoral adviser and  former Congressman.         Mrs. Badillo worked for the Carey and Cuomo administrations as the deputy director of the Division for Women from 1978 until 1986, when she took over the  New York City office of the State Department of Social Services. She retired in  1990.         As the Deputy Director of the Division for Women, Mrs. Badillo helped run the state's efforts to pass an Equal Rights Amendment, organizing rallies and conferences in various cities and towns.         "She was one of the strongest and most passionate defenders of the Equal Rights Amendment," Mr. Badillo said. "The amendment lost, but in New York State  we put up a tremendous fight for it, and she was a big part of it."         Even before her career in state government, Mrs. Badillo was active on social issues. In the 1960's she worked for two poverty programs: the Suburban Action Institute, which aimed to build low- and moderate-income housing in New York, and the Center for Urban Education, which focused on the needs of New York City schools.         Mrs. Badillo was born in New York City. She was a graduate of Empire State College.         Her first marriage ended in divorce. In addition to Mr. Badillo, she is survived by two children from a previous marriage, Loren Liebling of Honolulu and Dr. Mark Liebling of Nashua, N.H., and three grandchildren.       
         Mary Perot Nichols, the strong-willed former head of the television and radio stations operated by New York City, and a former columnist and city editor of The Village Voice, died yesterday in the hospice of the Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 69.         She died of pancreatic cancer, her family said.         A friend and ally of Edward I. Koch, the former Mayor, for 40 years, Ms. Nichols twice served as president of the WNYC Communications Group, with two radio stations, WNYC-AM and WNYC-FM, and a television station, WNYC-TV, Channel  31, licensed and partly financed by the city.         Ms. Nichols's most lasting professional contribution may have been the creation of the WNYC Foundation in the late 1970's, founded to attract private funds so the communications group could survive despite dwindling city financing. The foundation is awaiting approval from the Federal Communications Commission to buy WNYC-AM and FM, which are to remain public stations. Last week, the F.C.C. cleared the way for the city to sell the commercial license for WNYC-TV to the ITT Corporation and Dow Jones, which plan to create a sports, financial and entertainment superstation.         Under Ms. Nichols's leadership, the radio station became an important contributor to the city's cultural life and a major producer of programs for National Public Radio, including "Kids America," a live call-in program for children that won several broadcasting awards.         Mayor Koch first appointed Ms. Nichols to head WNYC Communications in 1978 on the heels of the city's fiscal crisis, when budget-conscious politicians called  for sale of the stations. She not only kept them going but also began station renovations.         When she resigned after two years to become director of communications at the University of Pennsylvania, she tossed off a tart farewell: doing creative work  for the city-owned stations was, she said, "a little like trying to cook a gourmet meal with glue on the kitchen floor."         Ms. Nichols left WNYC because of a disagreement with Mayor Koch when he insisted that the radio station run "The John Hour," in which the names of nine  men convicted of patronizing prostitutes were read over WNYC-AM. Mr. Koch theorized that the embarrassing exposure would cut into the prostitution trade and also argued that the Mayor should be allowed to control programming. "The John Hour" ran only once, but there was an outcry, and Ms. Nichols was made "uncomfortable," Mr. Koch said.         But he wooed her back to lead the communications group from 1983 to 1990, when Mayor David N. Dinkins replaced her with his own choice. She then became a  visiting professor of journalism at New York University, a post she held until her death.         Born in York, Pa., Mary Perot grew up near Philadelphia and in Buffalo. Friends say her Main Line family offered her a choice: she could have a "coming-out tea" or a college education. She selected college and in 1948 graduated from Swarthmore College with a degree in political science.         She lived with her husband and three children in Greenwich Village, and was involved in local issues, particularly the effort to stop Robert Moses from putting a road through Washington Square Park. She kept nudging Dan Wolf, a founding editor of The Village Voice, to write about the park. He encouraged her to write about the danger to the park herself, and she did.         Soon she became a mainstay of the young newspaper, first as a reporter, then  as author of "Runnin' Scared," a column about city politics.         A competitive writer with a streak of indignation -- "Mary had the kind of anger that made abolitionists," said a former colleague, Jerry Tallmer, the writer -- she wrote extensively about organized crime and political corruption and was among the loudest critics of the Lower Manhattan Expressway and then Westway. Neither was built.         "Mary had spies everywhere," said Clark Whelton, a former Voice reporter who  is now a speechwriter for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. "She seemed to know things  other people never found out. She would do the legwork herself, sit through long meetings, read documents nobody else would read, make connections nobody else would make."         Before she left the paper for good in the mid-1970's, she took two years off  to serve as a public relations aide in the city's Parks Department. It was a heady time, during Mayor John V. Lindsay's first term, and the energetic Parks Commissioner, Thomas P. F. Hoving, staged happenings -- concerts and other events to draw the public to the once placid parks.         "In the revolution of 1966, Mary was a key player," said Henry Stern, the current Commissioner of the Parks Department who was then its executive director. "Hoving was brand new to city government, but she knew all about it. He got the nickname Thomas P. F. Hoving, P. F. for Publicity Forever, but Mary Nichols made it happen."         Ms. Nichols soon grew disillusioned with Mr. Hoving and Mr. Lindsay, who became one of many favorite targets in her columns once she returned to The Voice in 1968.         As The Voice's city editor, she encouraged young writers and seemed to thrive on feuds with politicians and colleagues. Some accused her of trying to promote  the interests of Mr. Koch, her old friend. She acknowledged that she often agreed with him, but asserted that "when I disagreed with him, I let him have it."         Shortly after The Voice's founders sold it in the mid-1970's, a new editor dismissed Ms. Nichols. In 1977, she became communications director to Mayor Kevin S. White of Boston for just under a year. Then, after Mr. Koch's election  that year, she took on the WNYC job.         Ms. Nichols's marriage to Robert B. Nichols, a writer, ended in divorce.         She is survived by two daughters, Eliza Nichols of Williamsburg, Va., and Kerstin Nichols of Hartford, Vt.; a son, Duncan, of Thetford, Vt.; a brother, Charles Perot, and two grandchildren.       
         Shelley List, a novelist and a producer of the television series "Cagney and  Lacey," died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 65 and lived in Venice, Calif.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, Jonathan Estrin, who was also her longtime business partner.         Ms. List was born in Manhattan. She earned a bachelor's degree in literature from Reed College in 1951 and a master's degree in literature from Teachers College of Columbia University in 1952. In the 1960's she reviewed theater for the Westport News in Westport, Conn., and wrote feature articles for the Fairpress in Fairfield, Conn.         After writing the novels "Did You Love Daddy When I Was Born?" (1972) and "Nobody Makes Me Cry" (1975), Ms. List moved to California to try her hand at television writing. She sold her first treatment, which was made into the 1979 movie "And Baby Makes Six," with Colleen Dewhurst. Ms. List wrote the script.         Beginning in the 1980's, she and her husband created, wrote and produced the  mini-series "Between Friends," which was based on Ms. List's novel "Nobody Makes Me Cry"; "Daniel Steele's 'Jewels,' " "Amazing Grace" and "Barbara Taylor Bradford's 'Remember.' " Other television credits include the situation comedy "City," with Valerie Harper, and the pilot episode of "Sisters."         From 1986 to 1988, Ms. List and her husband were the supervising producers of "Cagney and Lacey, " a role they assumed when the original producer of the series, Terry Louise Fischer, left to develop "L.A. Law." They wrote the second  part of a two-episode drama in which Lacey recognizes and deals with her alcoholism.         Her first marriage, to Murray List, ended in divorce.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Julie List Faggella and Abigail List, both of Manhattan; two brothers, Peter Steinmann and  Daniel Steinmann; a stepson, Zachary Estrin, and a grandson.         Correction:         An obituary on Thursday about Shelley List, a television producer, misidentified the character who struggled with alcoholism in an episode of "Cagney and Lacey" written by Ms. List and her husband, Jonathan Estrin. The character was Cagney, not Lacey.

         Bettina Bancroft, a former director of Dow Jones & Company, which publishes The Wall Street Journal and Barron's magazine, died on Tuesday, at her Los Angeles home. Ms. Bancroft, who was 55, also had a residence in Manhattan, where she was involved in foundation work.         The cause was cancer, her husband, Andrew Klink, said.         A great-granddaughter of Clarence W. Barron, who bought Dow Jones in 1902 from a co-founder, Charles H. Dow, she became a director in 1982 to represent the Bancroft and Barron family descendants. She retired from the board in April, but remained a director of the Dow Jones Foundation.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her mother, Bettina Gray of Rancho Santa Fe, Calif.; a daughter, Elisabeth Goth of Del Mar, Calif.; three brothers, Christopher Bancroft of Denton, Tex., Hugh Bancroft 3d of Aspen, Colo., and William P. Liscomb 3d of Carlsbad, Calif., and a sister, Kathryn Kavadas of Waban, Mass.         A previous marriage, to Michael R. Goth, ended in divorce in 1974. A son, Michael B. Goth, died in 1990.       
         Dorothy Hyson, a Chicago-born stage and screen actress of the 1930's and 40's who was famed for her beauty, died on Thursday in a London hospital. She was 81  and had moved to London with her parents as a child.         She had been in declining health after suffering a stroke, The Times of London reported.         Miss Hyson's second husband, the actor and director Sir Anthony Quayle, once remarked: "It was not only her beauty that possessed me. It was a radiant lightness of heart."         She was often said to have inspired the 1935 Rodgers and Hart hit song "The Most Beautiful Girl in the World," with what The Guardian on Saturday called "her blue eyes, blond hair, and fragile singing and dancing style."         Miss Hyson made her screen debut as a child in the movie "Money Mad" and her  stage debut in London in a 1927 play, "Quality Street," by J. M. Barrie.         The Daily Telegraph said that on the London stage she "scored her greatest triumph in the thriller 'Pink String and Sealing Wax,' " which opened in 1943.         Her first marriage, to the actor Robert Douglas, ended in divorce. Sir Anthony died in 1989. Her mother, the musical-comedy star Dorothy Dickson, died  last year at the age of 102.         Miss Hyson is survived by two daughters and a son.       
         Tamara Toumanova, a child-prodigy ballerina of the 1930's who became familiar to American audiences as one of the most glamorous stars of 20th-century dance,  died on Wednesday at the Santa Monica Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 77 and lived in Beverly Hills.         She died after a brief illness, said John Taras, a friend.         By the time she was 13, Miss Toumanova was internationally acclaimed as one  of the three so-called baby ballerinas of Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes. She and two other phenomenally gifted daughters of Russian emigres -- Irina Baronova and Tatiana Riabouchinska -- were discovered in Parisian ballet studios by George Balanchine. They soon became the talk of London and New York.         Adoring fans nicknamed Miss Toumanova "the black pearl of the Russian ballet." Even as a teen-ager, her beauty was as remarkable as her technique. Kathrine Sorley Walker, a British dance historian, said of her in "De Basil's Ballets Russes" (1983) that with her "large dark eyes, raven wings of hair and magnolia skin, she combined lyricism and virtuosity to a remarkable degree."         A founding member of the de Basil Ballets Russes in 1932, Miss Toumanova inspired two of this century's greatest choreographers. She created roles in Balanchine's "Cotillon" and "Concurrence" and in Leonide Massine's "Jeux d'Enfants" with the company. She left the following year and was given starring  roles by Balanchine in his short-lived troupe Les Ballets 1933. Returning to the Ballets Russes a few months afterward, she danced in the classics as well as in  such new works by Massine as "Choreartium" and "Symphonie Fantastique." Later in her career, she performed with Ballet Theater, now American Ballet Theater, and appeared in a number of Hollywood films.         Miss Toumanova was born on March 2, 1919, in a boxcar in Siberia. She was the daughter of a czarist army colonel and his wife, who were fleeing the Bolsheviks. The couple settled in Paris, where their daughter became a pupil of  Olga Preobrajenska, a Russian-born teacher.         Miss Toumanova astonished balletgoers in 1929, at the age of 9, when she appeared at the Paris Opera in "L'Eventail de Jeanne," a ballet with a cast of children. Reviewing the production in the theatrical magazine Comoedia, Andre Levinson, the most famous Parisian ballet critic of the time, called Miss Toumanova's dancing both "astonishing" and "frightening."         When quarrels between de Basil and Massine prompted the choreographer to form his own company, Miss Toumanova became a member of Massine's new Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1938. She dropped out of the company the next year to appear in the Broadway musical "Stars in Your Eyes," and rejoined de Basil's company for an Australian tour and the New York season that followed it in 1940. She was once again a member of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo from 1940 to 1942, and during the 1944-45 season, was a star of Ballet Theater.         As she toured the world, Miss Toumanova was accompanied by her mother, Eugenia, one of the most famous of the "ballet mothers" of the 1930's. These mothers went everywhere with their daughters, serving as dressers, laundresses,  cooks and pet keepers. In addition, the mothers were their daughters' fiercest partisans and sternest critics. Eugenia Toumanova was also said to be fond of fortune telling, faith healing and poker playing.         When, as a member of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, Miss Toumanova was cast in the virtuosic Black Swan pas de deux from "Swan Lake," she and her mother would minutely inspect the stage to choose the spot at which the ballerina would perform a notoriously difficult series of whipping turns known as fouettes. Then they would pray over that spot. The fouettes never faltered. Grace Robert, an American dance historian, said of the Black Swan in her "Borzoi Book of Ballets" (1946): "Tamara Toumanova is at her exciting best in this tour de force, its vertiginous turns and sustained balances exactly suiting her temperament and forceful technique."         Miss Toumanova's later career, although a distinguished one, did not always seem as remarkable as her youthful achievements. After leaving Ballet Theater, she became a freelance ballerina, appearing with such companies as the Paris Opera Ballet, London Festival Ballet and the Marquis de Cuevas Grand Ballet. During the 1960's, she toured extensively in South America with Vladimir Oukhtomsky as her partner.         She created two notable roles with the Paris Opera Ballet. In 1947, she was a star of "Le Palais de Cristal," the glittering abstract ballet by Balanchine that is known in America as "Symphony in C." Three years later, she displayed her dramatic talents in the title role of Serge Lifar's "Phedre."         Some critics thought Miss Toumanova acquired annoying mannerisms. Reviewing her in the London Festival Ballet production of "Swan Lake" in 1955, John Martin, who was then the dance critic of The New York Times, complained that "her grandiosity (including some incredible bows) smothered the whole work like  so much thick chocolate sauce."         Nevertheless, she remained capable of extraordinary performances. Seeing her  at the Paris Opera in 1950, the American critic Edward Denby wrote in "Dancers,  Buildings and People in the Streets" (1965) that he was distressed by her "careless feet, limp and wormy arms, brutally deformed phrasings" but that his objections vanished when she offered "a few terrifying extensions, a few incisive strokes that counted phenomenally."         "At these moments," he went on, "she had so much vitality she made everyone else look as if they merely crept or scuttled about her while she danced."         Miss Toumanova acted and danced in several movies. She made her screen debut  in "Days of Glory" in 1944. That same year, she married the film's producer and  screen writer, Casey Robinson; the marriage ended in divorce. Miss Toumanova played the ballerina Anna Pavlova in "Tonight We Sing" in 1953 and appeared in "Deep in My Heart" in 1954. She had a starring role in "Invitation to the Dance," a ballet film directed by Gene Kelly in 1955. She was also in Alfred Hitchcock's "Torn Curtain" (1966) and Billy Wilder's "Private Life of Sherlock Holmes" (1969).         Miss Toumanova, who became an American citizen in 1944, lived quietly in later years at her home in Beverly Hills.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Theodora Ayer Randolph, who rode the Virginia hunt country long enough and well enough to become known as the first lady of fox hunting, died on Tuesday at her Oakley Farm home in Upperville, Va. She was 90.         It had been years since Mrs. Randolph had donned her dark-blue, gold-collared coat, tucked her auburn hair under her helmet and galloped off over the vast expanse of farmland that makes up the grounds of the 150-year-old landowners' association known as the Piedmont Hunt. But as a master of the Piedmont, she had remained an indispensable presence in the affairs of the nation's oldest and largest fox-hunting entity.         In an area 45 miles west of Washington, where generations-old farms are sometimes acquired by city-bred newcomers unaccustomed to seeing a horde of horsemen thunder across their front yards in pursuit of a pack of hounds in pursuit of a fox, no respecter of property lines, after all, it would be Mrs. Randolph's duty to pay the newcomers a call. Over a cup of tea, perhaps, she would acquaint them with the customs and traditions of the neighborhood, assuring them that the members of the Piedmont Hunt were always careful to close gates they might have opened and to not trample any flower beds near the house.         As a clincher, she would note that as landowners, the newcomers would be eligible to join the Piedmont, an act that would instantly elevate them to the upper reaches of Virginia society.         The widow of Dr. Archibald Cary Randolph, a landed surgeon whose family helped settle Virginia, Mrs. Randolph succeeded her husband as hunt master after his death in 1959. But she was something of a newcomer herself. In an area where the first families of Virginia can be downright condescending to those who trace their ancestry to only the second wave of settlers, Mrs. Randolph achieved social prominence and fox-hunting distinction despite the fact that she was an actual Yankee.         Mrs. Randolph was born Sept. 27, 1905, in Beverly Farms, Mass., and learned to ride at the age of 3. Her father was master of the local Myopia Hunt, and she was fox hunting long before she saw Virginia.         Even so, she readily acknowledged that she received some of her most vivid training in advanced fence-jumping during Virginia visits to her daredevil uncle, General George S. Patton.         Mrs. Randolph -- whose first marriage, to the Massachusetts-born New York investment banker Robert Winthrop, ended in divorce -- married well twice and was born better.         Her father, Charles Ayer, was a member of the family that settled Ayer, Mass., and made a considerable fortune dealing in woolens and patent medicines,  including the 19th-century tonic rage, sarsaparilla.         After her divorce, Mrs. Randolph, who had fallen in love with the Virginia hunt country during her years at Foxcroft, a Virginia boarding school, settled there and renewed her acquaintance with Dr. Randolph, whom she had known as the  dashing master of the Piedmont Hunt during her boarding school days.         After their marriage in 1941, she became active in every aspect of equestrian affairs, breeding show and steeplechase champions, leading a drive to ban the use of performance-enhancing drugs and receiving numerous honors for her work, including an honorary degree from the University of Pennsylvania School of Veterinary Medicine.         But it was as a highly accomplished horsewoman, one who could take the lead in an organization that prides itself on being the nation's fastest hunt ("Keep  up or go home" is one of its official rules), that she won greatest acclaim.         It was a tribute to her standing, and her reputation for social observation,  that in her later years newcomers tended to come to her.         In an area of such sprawling acreage and long driveways that next-door neighbors tend to drive over when they visit, Mrs. Randolph lived next door to Paul Mellon, not that she could actually see the Pittsburgh banking heir's house from her own.         But she could see his private landing strip from her parlor window and took wry delight in the extravagant idiosyncrasies of the very wealthy. Whenever she  would see the Mellons's private plane land and then take off 10 minutes later, her step-granddaughter and farm manager, Becky Armstrong, recalled yesterday, Mrs. Randolph would take a sip of her tea and nod knowingly: It was only Mrs. Mellon, she would say, come home to fetch a scarf.         Mrs. Randolph is survived by three children from her first marriage, Theodora Hooton of Glen Head, N.Y., Amory Winthrop of Millbrook, N.Y., and Cornelia Bonnie of Prospect, Ky.; five grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.       
         Harriett Heywood Patton, a founder of Recording for the Blind and a managing  director of the Metropolitan Opera Guild, died on Wednesday at Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville. She was 85 and lived in Bronxville.         She suffered a brief illness, her husband, Arch Patton, said.         Mrs. Patton is credited with contributing significantly to the growth of Recording for the Blind, which she served as president in 1954, and of the Opera Guild. She was managing director of the guild from 1959 to 1968.         She was born in Indianapolis and graduated from Wheelock College in Boston. During and after World War II, she worked for United China Relief and the Friends of France and played a pivotal role on the Committee for Economic Development, a national organization.         The committee brought together top corporate executives to plan for the postwar era; Mrs. Patton was recruited as deputy director.         Acting as a welcoming party of one, she kept track of the members' comings and goings and saw to it that they were fed, chauffeured and otherwise cared for.         In 1948, she was a founder of Recording for the Blind, and she helped build it from a local group in New York for the benefit of blind war veterans into a national organization. She crusaded across the country to get concerned people to band together in local chapters and open recording studios for volunteers to  do the readings.         Eleanor R. Belmont, founder of the Opera Guild and a friend, persuaded Mrs. Patton to turn her attention in that direction and become managing director. During her tenure of nearly 10 years, the guild's membership and donations quickly increased, both in the United States and abroad.         Mrs. Patton, who had served as a director, was familiar with the operation and earned a reputation for running a trim ship. Annual gifts to the guild, $90,000 in Mrs. Patton's first year as chief executive, rose nearly fourfold, to $355,000.         She grew up in Portland, Me., and acted in summer stock for three years as a  young woman.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Patton left no immediate family. An earlier marriage to Roswell L. Gilpatric ended in divorce.       
         Anne W. Simon, an environmentalist whose books explored the perils to the world's seas and shorelines, particularly on her beloved Martha's Vineyard, died on Monday at her Manhattan home. She was 82 and also had a home in Chilmark, Mass.         At her death she was working on a book on the changing nature of Martha's Vineyard and what might be done to save the island where she had summered for many years. An article based on its first chapter was published in the July issue of the monthly Martha's Vineyard Magazine.         The article echoed her earlier book, "No Island Is an Island: The Ordeal of  Martha's Vineyard" (1973). There she told the tale of how the Vineyard, after hundreds of years of slumber, surrendered to tract subdivisions, an explosion of second homes, sewage spillovers and traffic jams.         Another volume, "The Thin Edge: Coast and Man in Crisis" (1978), discussed the precarious state of dunes and beaches, wetlands and estuaries everywhere that economic development reaches them. "Neptune's Revenge: The Ocean of Tomorrow" (1984) was an unsparing critique of the environmental damage to oceans from oil spills, overfishing, the greenhouse effect and the dumping of sewage, toxins and radioactive waste.         Anne Wertheim was born in Cos Cob, Conn., and in 1935 graduated from Smith College, where she edited the campus newspaper. She earned a master's degree at  the School of Social Work of Columbia University.         She was a writer at radio station WNYC, became a television critic for The Nation and subsequently wrote for McCall's, Good Housekeeping and other periodicals. Her first book was "Stepchild in the Family: A View of Children in  Remarriage" (1964), a primer based on her own experience as a stepchild and as a stepparent.         She was married three times and had taken the surname of her last husband, Prof. Walter Werner, while keeping her pen name. He died in 1986. Her previous marriages, to Dr. Louis Langman and Robert Simon, ended in divorce.         She is survived by a son and three daughters from her first marriage: Thomas  Langman of Washington, Betsy L. Schulberg of Westhampton Beach, L.I., Lynn L. Lilienthal of Reston, Va., and Deborah L. Lesser of Berkeley, Calif., and 11 grandchildren.       
         Pamela Mason, an author, actress, talk-show host and former wife of the actor James Mason, died on Saturday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 80.         Pamela Helen Mason was born in Southend-on-Sea, England, the daughter of Isadore and Helen Ostrer. Her father was a mill owner and was also in the movie business. Mrs. Mason said that part of her later success was that she left school at age 9; education, she said, only confuses the mind.         She was 16 when she married Roy Kellino, a cinematographer. A young actor named James Mason came to stay with the couple, and they began collaborating on  a film, "I Met a Murderer." She fell in love with Mr. Mason and married him in 1940, after divorcing Mr. Kellino.         The Masons and their 12 cats moved to Hollywood in 1946, and Mr. Mason went on to make his career as the smooth-voiced leading man in such films as "Lolita" and "A Star Is Born."         The two were a contrast in styles. He was quiet to the point of dourness while Mrs. Mason would begin her day by telephoning Hollywood friends for the latest news. The writer Nora Ephron said the talkative Mrs. Mason had been "vaccinated with a phonograph needle."         The Masons acted on Broadway in "Bathsheba" in 1947, and during the 1950's they appeared together on the "James Mason Show," on television. They were divorced in 1964. Mrs. Mason was represented by the well-known divorce attorney  Marvin Mitchelson, and one of the terms of her settlement was $1 million in community property. The settlement, Mr. Mason is said to have remarked, was one  reason he was forced to make so many bad movies.         Mrs. Mason had two syndicated talk shows on television during the 1960's, "The Pamela Mason Show" and "The Weaker (?) Sex."         Among her books were "Marriage Is the First Step Toward Divorce" and "The Female Pleasure Hunt," which advised women on every subject from love to putting on makeup to buying a house.         She continued to have roles in films, including the 1985 television movie "My Wicked, Wicked Ways: The Legend of Errol Flynn."         She is survived by her two children with Mr. Mason: a daughter, Portland, and a son, Morgan.       
         The badly decomposed body of the actress and model Margaux Hemingway, who was once described as the face of a generation, was discovered by friends on Monday  in her home in Santa Monica, Calif., the police said. She was 41.         Santa Monica police investigators arrived at Ms. Hemingway's apartment at 1:52 P.M., said Sgt. Gary Gallinot, a department spokesman. Ms. Hemingway, a granddaughter of Ernest Hemingway, had not been seen since Friday, and friends were concerned, the sergeant said. He said there were no signs of forced entry or foul play.         A spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner's office, Fred Corral, said yesterday that autopsy results would not be available for about two weeks but that a preliminary investigation pointed to death by "apparent natural causes,"  possibly linked to Ms. Hemingway's history of epilepsy. Ms. Hemingway had also struggled publicly with alcoholism and bulimia.         When Ms. Hemingway did not respond to phone calls or knocks on the door, friends asked a laborer working in the neighborhood to get a ladder so they could enter the home through a balcony, Sergeant Gallinot said. Ms. Hemingway had recently moved into the studio apartment near the beach.         Her agent, David Mirisch, told CNN that she had recently finished narrating a series on animals.         Tall, blond and glamorous, Ms. Hemingway achieved nearly instant renown in the 1970's as a supermodel. She began her career at the urging of a former husband, Errol Wetson, a film producer and a founder and former owner of the Wetson hamburger chain.         Joe Eula, the New York fashion artist, said in 1975 that Ms. Hemingway had "the face of a generation, as recognizable and memorable as Lisa Fonssagrives and Jean Shrimpton."         Later that year, she signed what The New Yorker called "the largest single advertising contract ever involving a female personality." The $1 million contract made her the spokeswoman for Babe, a fragrance line developed by Faberge.         She made her screen debut in "Lipstick" in 1976, opposite her younger sister, Mariel. The film, which received negative reviews, was about a young model who seeks vengeance after she is raped, then humiliated when a jury acquits the defendant. Ms. Hemingway's acting career faltered, while her sister fared better, appearing in films like Woody Allen's "Manhattan."         Ms. Hemingway was born in Portland, Ore., in 1955, the second of the three daughters of John Hadley and Byra Whitlock Hemingway. She was said to have changed her name from Margot when she learned that her parents drank Chateau Margaux on the night of her conception.         The family spent several years on Ernest Hemingway's farm in Cuba. They then  moved to San Francisco, where her father was a stockbroker. In 1967, the family  moved to mountainous Ketchum, Idaho, where Ernest Hemingway had committed suicide six years earlier.         Ms. Hemingway's two marriages, first to Mr. Wetson, then to Bernardo Faucher, a French-born film maker, ended in divorce.         In addition to her sister, she is survived by her father and stepmother.       
         Joanne Dru, who starred opposite John Wayne in the westerns ''Red River'' and ''She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,'' died on Tuesday at her home in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 74.         The cause was a respiratory illness, The Associated Press reported.         Ms. Dru was born in Logan, W. Va. When her father died, she moved to New York with her mother and found work as a model for the Powers agency while still a teen-ager, changing her last name from LaCock to Marshall. She danced in the chorus of ''Hold Onto Your Hats,'' Al Jolson's last Broadway show, before marrying the crooner Dick Haymes, who took her to Hollywood when he was signed for film roles.         In Hollywood, she caught the eye of the director Howard Hawks, who changed her last name to Dru. After making her screen debut in ''Abie's Irish Rose'' in 1946, she was given the role of Tess Millay in Hawks's classic western ''Red River'' (1948). In the film she makes a memorable entrance, pinned to a wagon by an arrow during an Indian attack, a crisis that is solved by Montgomery Clift.         A year later, John Ford directed her in ''She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,'' in which, as Olivia Dandridge, she turned the heads of the United States  Cavalry. After appearing in ''All the King's Men'' (1949), she teamed up with Ford again for ''Wagon Master,'' starring opposite Ben Johnson.         In the 1950's, she made many films for 20th Century Fox, including ''711 Ocean Drive,'' ''Mr. Belvedere Rings the Bell,'' ''The Pride of St. Louis,'', ''Thunder Bay,'' ''Hell on Frisco Bay.'' Most were a cut or two below the films she had made just a few years earlier. In ''Sincerely Yours,'' she played Liberace's love interest, and in ''Three Ring Circus,'' a Dean Martin-Jerry Lewis film, she was cast as Martin's girlfriend.         In ''Guestward Ho!,'' a television sitcom that ran from 1960 to 1961, she played Babs Hooten, a New Yorker transplanted to a rundown dude ranch in New Mexico.         She was married three times. Her second marriage, to the actor John Ireland, whom she met on the set of ''Red River,'' ended in divorce. Her last marriage was to C. V. Wood, a businessman.         She is survived by her children,  Richard Haymes Jr. of New York City and Helen Joanna Santos of Monterey, Calif. (a daughter, Barbara Nugent Haymes, died three years ago); six grandchildren; six great-grandchildren, and her brothers, Peter Marshall, the television game-show host, and David Moss of Sedona, Ariz.       
         Elizabeth Bottomley Noyce, a microchip millionaire's scorned first wife who showed as much imagination and verve in deploying her half of his Silicon Valley fortune as he had in making it, died on Tuesday at her seaside home in Bremen, Me. She was 65 and had been the state's premier philanthropist and most innovative investor for two decades.         Her lawyer, Owen Wells, noting that Mrs. Noyce had long suffered from emphysema, said the cause was a heart attack.         The daughter of a blue-collar worker from Auburn, Mass., who had to hold two jobs to support his family in the Depression, Mrs. Noyce was majoring in English at Tufts University in the early 1950's and dreaming of becoming a writer when she signed on as costume director of a summer theatrical production and caught the eye of one of the cast members, a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology named Robert N. Noyce.         The couple were married in 1953, and Mrs. Noyce, who had dreamed of writing novels and short stories, became the most dutiful of corporate wives, bearing four children and following her husband from job to job, including a somewhat reluctant move to California for a woman who never felt comfortable away from her beloved New England.         ''We were under the distinct impression that we would try it for a year and if I didn't like it we wouldn't stay,'' she recalled years later, suggesting that her husband had forgotten the bargain: ''We stayed 19 years.''         By then the life of the blue-collar worker's daughter had changed considerably, largely because her husband had become a co-inventor of the microchip, which laid the foundation for the vast personal computer industry, and had helped found three of the industry's premier companies, including the giant Intel Corporation.         Her life changed even more in 1975 when Mr. Noyce left her to marry an Intel executive. Although bitter over the circumstances of the breakup of her marriage, Mrs. Noyce, whose husband died in 1990, managed to console herself somewhat in the divorce. Under California's community property laws she claimed half his Intel stock and all his other assets, including full title to their 50-acre Maine estate, where Mrs. Noyce had been spending summers.         How much she received from the divorce could not be determined yesterday, and a spokesman for Intel, which has a market capitalization of $86 billion, could not say how much stock she owned at the time of her death. Mr. Wells, her lawyer, said, however, that after all her charitable donations, her estate was worth $100 million to $1 billion.         Putting her husband and California behind her, Mrs. Noyce did not so much move to Maine as adopt the state.         In a whirlwind of philanthropy that began almost as soon as she settled into her house on Muscongus Bay and continued the rest of her life, she systematically gave away some $75 million, primarily to Maine charities.         Oh, there would be the occasional out-of-state donation -- a million to Tufts here, a half-million to Harvard there -- but for the most part Mrs. Noyce, whose donations covered the gamut of public causes including education, medicine, the arts and the environment, concentrated her giving in Maine, responding to virtually any cause, charity or public institution in the state that needed money.         Among other things, she built a golf course for the town of Bremen, gave lavishly to the Portland Museum of Art, the Maine Maritime Museum and the University of Maine. When the Cumberland County Civic Center was so pressed for cash that it was looking for a corporate sponsor that would give it money in exchange for the right to give the center its name, Mrs. Noyce came through with a $1.3 million donation that allowed the center to retain its identity.         But for all the acclaim Mrs. Noyce received for her direct philanthropy, including the $15 million in endowments for charitable trusts that make independent grants to Maine charities, Mrs. Noyce gained even more applause when she began pioneering what she called ''catalytic philanthropy,'' investments designed to bolster the state's economy.         In 1991, for example, when out-of-state financial institutions were picking off Maine's banks one by one and it appeared that Maine businesses and other borrowers would soon be at the mercy of distant lenders, Mrs. Noyce blithely created a brand new bank, the Maine Bank and Trust Company with an initial $7.7 million investment that eventually grew to some $14 million.         What made such ''philanthropy,'' especially appealing became apparent when the bank prospered. Mr. Wells, who advised Mrs. Noyce on her investments, estimated yesterday that the bank was now worth at least twice what she paid for it.         During a lull in Maine's construction industry, Mrs. Noyce built five homes to provide jobs for construction workers, and when Maine's leading bakery was threatened with a takeover by a company that intended to move it out of state, Mrs. Noyce came to the rescue, buying the bakery and saving its 1,200 jobs.         Recently Mrs. Noyce had turned her attention to Portland's deteriorating downtown, going on a buying spree in which she acquired about 10 percent of the city's office and retail space. The rehabilitation effort attracted L. L. Bean and other tenants.         Although her efforts won wide praise, there were some rumblings that Mrs. Noyce was becoming too big a factor in the Portland economy and she had recently announced that she had no further designs on downtown property.         For all her wealth, Mrs. Noyce lived fairly simply, shunning the usual trappings of wealth and even driving her own car, most recently a Cadillac, to be sure, but only, she told her friends, because after a wreck in her smaller Oldsmobile, she felt more secure in a larger car.         Although she was always appropriately dressed, Mrs. Noyce had no interest in fashion and even less in travel, preferring to stay in Maine rather than visit the world's resorts.         Not that she was above the occasional indulgence. When she found that the steep driveway to her house became dangerously slick with wintertime ice, she built a more accessible winter home a thousand feet away.         Her only real material weakness stemmed from her love of the water, but it was a tribute to her reputation for innovative ''catalytic philanthropy,'' that when she indulged her passion by commissioning a multimillion-dollar 60-foot yacht a few years ago, the acquisition was not viewed in Maine as an example of conspicuous consumption. Instead the purchase was trumpeted in the Maine press as a rescue of Maine's boat-building industry.         In recent months Mrs. Noyce had apparently developed renewed concern about the state's beleaguered boat builders. She had commissioned a 90-foot yacht.         Mrs. Noyce is survived by a son, William, of Hollis, N.H.; three daughters, Pendred of Weston, Mass.; Priscilla, of Kenya and Margaret, of Montana; two brothers, Frank Bottomley of Ohio and Bruce, of New Hampshire; a sister, Frances Broomhead of Rhode Island, and 13 grandchildren.       
         Annabella, a film star with flashing eyes who became the toast of France in the 1930's, died on Wednesday at her home in Neuilly-sur-Seine, a suburb of Paris. She was 86.         The cause was a heart attack, said a friend, Jose Sourillan, according to The Associated Press.         Annabella, whose real name was Suzanne Georgette Charpentier, was the daughter of a French publisher. She rose to celebrity when she starred in two films directed by Rene Clair: ''Le Million'' (1931), about hunting for a lost lottery ticket, and ''Quatorze Juillet,'' or ''July 14th'' (1933), about the adventures of a flower girl and a cab driver. They are still widely regarded as her finest work.         Her skill at playing the gamine became known in the United States, where The New York American commented in 1937: ''Among screen types she is like a fresh breeze among too many orchidaceous blooms. Her eyes are frank, her forehead high and her mouth childishly quizzical.''         She moved on to Hollywood and starred in a down-to-earth role opposite Tyrone Power when he played the canal builder in ''Suez'' (1938). Later that year, when her plans to divorce the French actor Jean Murat drew wide attention, she was quoted in The New York Mirror as saying: ''It is not always good to be a film star in America. It is like being a goldfish in a bowl. They must know what I eat, what I think, they even want to know whom I love -- and that I tell no one.''         In 1939 she married Power. She appeared in four other American films and in 1942 became an American citizen. But Annabella achieved only minor success in her adopted country. She returned to France for good after a divorce in 1948 from Power, who went on to marry the actress Linda Christian.         Back in Europe, Annabella failed to regain her earlier acclaim. Her last film was ''Le Plus Bel Amour de Don Juan'' (1952).         In her teens she started out as a dancer. She made her first screen appearance, at 16, under the name Annabella, in a minor role in the epic-length silent film ''Napoleon'' (1926), with Abel Gance as director and screenwriter. Other minor film parts followed, until she was chosen by Clair, regarded by the film world as an original stylist, for her roles in ''Le Million'' and ''Quatorze Juillet.''         In 1936 she moved on to Britain, where she starred in three movies made there in 1937: ''Wings of the Morning,'' which was in color, ''Under the Red Robe'' and ''Dinner at the Ritz.''         Then Hollywood beckoned, and she appeared in ''The Baroness and the Butler'' (1938) before taking the role in ''Suez.'' That year she also found time to star in ''Hotel du Nord,'' directed by Marcel Carne, a classic with a fond view of working-class Parisians.         In 1940 Annabella and Power performed together in the Screen Guild radio production of ''Seventh Heaven,'' and the next year they were onstage together in a summer stock revival of Ferenc Molnar's hit ''Liliom.''         Over the years she took other roles in theatrical productions in New York, London and elsewhere.  The New York Times theater critic Brooks Atkinson praised her acting in a 1946 production of Jean-Paul Sartre's play ''No Exit'' as ''a bold and calculated performance that packs one corner of hell with horror.''         She is survived by a daughter, Anne Werner Power of Boston.       
         The train carrying Japan's most famous young couple chugs into the station and out comes Princess Masako, all charm and elegance in a pale-green suit, waving to her picture-snapping fans and walking briskly, two steps behind the Crown Prince.         That is almost the only kind of public appearance that Princess Masako makes these days -- a quick swish from a train to a car, en route to a hospital or charity -- for she has virtually disappeared since her marriage three years ago.         After a wedding that captivated this country, a union filled with the promise of imperial renaissance, these days there is only silence.         Before she married, Masako Owada was the symbol of the new Japanese career woman, an attractive Harvard-educated diplomat in the Foreign Ministry, moving with professional ease in five foreign languages.         When she became the Crown Princess, she was the second commoner ever to marry into the imperial family. Many in this nation brimmed with the hope that she could help  update the Chrysanthemum throne, ushering into the modern age a dynasty that is the world's oldest and is shrouded in pageantry and tradition.         Now Masako-san, as the Crown Princess is often called, has not only virtually vanished from sight, but is also measured by a standard that is thousands of years old: her ability to bear a son.         For the couple, producing an heir is a big responsibility. The Emperor, Akihito, is said to be the 125th direct descendant in an imperial dynasty that reaches back 26 centuries -- although these claims reflect the triumph of faith over scholarship.         But without a son in sight, people are openly discussing the succession. After Akihito, the throne goes to the Crown Prince, Naruhito, but if he dies without leaving a son, it will go to his younger brother, Prince Akishino. Akishino, however, has only two daughters now; after him, there is no male descendant.         So Japanese imperial-watchers are debating the possibility of seeing Chrysanthemum throne go to a daughter. After all, the dynasty was spawned by a Japanese sun goddess, Amaterasu, and 8 of Japan's 125 emperors have been women.         The last female emperor -- the title of empress is reserved for the emperor's wife -- reigned for seven years until 1770. Then a century ago, the imperial code was changed to forbid a woman from ascending the throne. Parliament would have to pass a new law before a woman could become emperor, but if that happened, then there would be potential long-term heirs. At least for now, for example, the throne could go to one of Prince Akishino's daughters, Mako and Kako.         Though the Crown Princess is only 32, there is an old Japanese saying, ''Marry for three years, and bear no child, then it's time to leave!'' But in a country where divorce is still uncommon, any kind of parting in the imperial family is unthinkable.         If there is any overwhelming feeling these days that ordinary Japanese have for the Crown Princess, it is sympathy. They tend to identify more with her as a commoner than with the Prince, and do not often discuss publicly the Prince's role in producing an heir.         ''She married into a position where her responsibility is to give birth to a boy, and I feel for her,'' said Naomi Yamaha, 33, a computer engineer. ''Even as commoners, there is a lot of pressure on you to have a boy if you marry the oldest son.''         And the pressure is a thousand times more intense for the Crown Princess, living in a gilded imperial cage where her every move is watched and evaluated.         ''Indeed, being the wife in the imperial family has got to be the No. 1  source of stress,'' said Rihachi Iizuka, a prominent fertility specialist at Keio University. ''That's why caged animals like monkeys and pandas in zoos don't have as many babies as the ones out in the wild.''         Princess Masako's royal zoo keepers are the 1,100 administrators and servants who form the Imperial Household Agency, a bastion of conservatism and protector of tradition and ritual. It has not only cloistered  Princess Masako and the Crown Prince, but many say it has created a greater distance between the imperial family and the ordinary Japanese people.         ''The Japanese imperial family is not in step with the times, with the perception of the new generation of citizens,'' said Toshiaki Kawahara, who has written many books on the imperial household. ''Unless they mix with the ordinary people, the imperial family will be forgotten.''         Another of the imperial tasks is to build links with other countries, the kind of diplomacy for which the Crown Princess spent her life training. But the couple's last trip abroad was to the Middle East in January 1995.         Some people say that the cloak of silence the Imperial Household Agency has now wrapped around her may be an effort to play down her presence until the royal couple produce an heir. Others say it is the agency's method of easing stress.         ''The agency wants to preserve a mood of tranquillity for the couple,'' said Minoru Hamao, a former chamberlain to the Emperor and a private tutor of the Crown Prince. ''If she comes out in public, she'd be surrounded by the press, by photographers, and it would make her nervous.''         Masako's mother-in-law, the Empress Michiko, the first commoner to be brought into the imperial fold, suddenly collapsed nearly three years ago in an incident that left her unable to speak for several months. It is still not clear what caused it, but many people blame Japan's gossipy magazines for triggering the Empress' breakdown with unflattering accounts of her.         Many ordinary Japanese blame the Imperial Household Agency for transforming the Crown Princess from a sophisticated, highly educated traveler into a dainty flower who studies poetry and ancient rituals.         ''Some women were happy having Masako-san enter the family, hoping the imperial system itself might change, but I said it would not be like that,'' said Mikiyo Kano, a professor who focuses on women in history. ''She's totally ignored. Unlike an empress, Masako-san is a yome, the wife of a son, and according to Confucian patriarchy, a yome doesn't hold any role, not even a place in the family.''         It is hard to imagine a more backward step for one of Japan's most talented career women. And indeed for the moment at least, she seems to be receding from the wider public's interest.         ''I look up to the female Japanese astronaut and the women athletes at the Olympics,'' said Yoko Nishimura, 49, a furniture store owner. ''I don't look up to Masako-san.''         The new Masako-san does have die-hard fans, like Harumi Tadakawa, a 30-year-old housewife who has spent $60,000 following the Crown Princess around the country. At the train station, Mrs. Tadakawa was snapping pictures to add to her collection of nearly 5,000 photographs of the imperial family.         But other Japanese prefer to follow the exploits of crowned heads elsewhere.         ''I care more about the British royal family, and I'm interested more in Queen Elizabeth and Princess Diana than in Masako-san,'' said Daisuke Sakaguchi, a 25-year-old clothing salesman. ''Whenever the imperial family gets sensational news coverage because of some ceremony, like Masako-san's wedding, for example, sure, I feel happy and want to congratulate them. But that's about it. The imperial family here is just too boring.''       
         Dorothy Lamour, whose sarong-draped charms adorned many films of the late 1930's and 40's, especially the ''road'' pictures she made with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, died yesterday at her home in North Hollywood, Calif. She was 81 years old.         Miss Lamour, a comely brunette who was also a favorite pinup of thousands of G.I.'s during World War II, was in her heyday at a time when the major studios believed that certain actresses needed something of a signature. Veronica Lake peered out from behind the lock of hair that invariably hid part of her face; Miss Lamour had her trademark sarong.  She wore that clinging garment in a series of films, from the 1936 ''Jungle Princess'' through such 1940's comedies as ''Road to Singapore'' and ''Road to Morocco.''         Miss Lamour appeared in seven of the road pictures, in which she was always the exotic but demure girl invariably won by a crooning Mr. Crosby at the expense of a more comedic Mr. Hope. On occasion, Miss Lamour would join Mr. Crosby in a ballad, such as ''Moonlight Becomes You'' or ''Constantly.'' By the late 1940's, her salary rose to a top of around $450,000 a movie.         But she had no illusions about either her acting or singing ability. Asked by an interviewer if she had ever studied acting or singing, she replied, ''No, can't you tell?''         During World War II, Miss Lamour was also known as ''the bond bombshell'' because of the volunteer work she did selling United States War Bonds. In tours around the country, she was credited with selling some $300 million of the bonds. So  effective was she as a saleswoman that the Government put a private railroad car at her disposal when she decided to go on a bond tour.         She received a belated citation for her bond work from the Treasury in 1965, at which time William H. Neal, at that time the director of the United States Savings Bond Division, credited her with being the first star to offer her services to sell war bonds and the originator of the successful Government plan for payroll deductions for those who wanted part of their salaries set aside for war bond purchases.         Her contributions to the war effort did not stop there. She was frequently seen at the Hollywood Canteen, the nightclub for servicemen founded by Bette Davis and John Garfield, where she spent many hours talking to and dancing with G.I.'s.         Miss Lamour was born on Dec. 10, 1914, in New Orleans as Mary Leta Dorothy Slaton, the daughter of John Watson Slaton and the former Carmen Louise La Porte. Her father was a waiter. Her mother, who soon divorced her father, worked as a waitress.         Young Dorothy never finished high school. The family finances were so desperate that when she was 15, she forged her mother's name to a document that authorized her to drop out of school.         Later, however, she did go to a secretarial school that did not require her to have a high school diploma. She regarded herself as an excellent typist and usually typed her own letters, even after she became quite wealthy.         After she won the 1931 Miss New Orleans beauty contest, she and her mother moved to Chicago, where  Miss Lamour earned $17 a week as an elevator operator for the Marshall Field department store on State Street. She had no training as a singer but was persuaded by a friend to try out for a female vocalist's spot with Herbie Kay, a band leader who  had a national radio show called ''The Yeast Foamers,'' apparently because it was sponsored by Fleischmann's Yeast.         She left Mr. Kay's group and moved to Manhattan, where Rudy Vallee, then a popular singer, helped her get a singing job at a popular night club, El Morocco. She later worked at 1 Fifth Avenue, a cabaret where she met Louis B. Mayer, the Hollywood studio chief. It was Mayer who eventually arranged for her to have a screen test, which led to her Paramount contract in 1935.         When she was at her zenith as a star, her fans suggested that an agent had adopted her last name from the French word for ''love'' as a box-office ploy. In fact, the name was close to one in the family; Miss Lamour adapted it herself from Lambour, which was the last name of her stepfather, Clarence, to whom her mother was briefly married.         Miss Lamour's more than 50 films included ''Typhoon'' (1939), ''Johnny Apollo'' (1940), ''The Fleet's In'' (1941), ''Star-Spangled Rhythm'' (1942), ''Duffy's Tavern'' (1945),  ''Here Comes the Groom'' (1951), ''Donovan's Reef'' (1962) and ''Pajama Party'' (1964).         The seven movies in which she appeared with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope were ''Road to Singapore (1940), ''Road to Zanzibar'' (1941), ''Road to Morocco'' (1942), ''Road to Utopia'' (1946), ''Road to Rio'' (1948) ''Road to Bali'' (1953) and ''Road to Hong Kong'' (1962). Although Miss Lamour worked closely with Mr. Hope and Crosby for many years, she said that she was not close to them personally.         Miss Lamour's first marriage, to Herbie Kay, ended in divorce. She met her second husband, William  Ross Howard 3d, in 1943 while she was on a bond tour. Mr. Howard, who had interests in the frozen food and advertising businesses, died in 1978.         After she retired from the movies, Miss Lamour remained active. In 1968, she starred in the national road show production of ''Hello, Dolly!'' And in 1969, she was named to the Civic Center Commission of Baltimore, where she then lived. She was active in various causes there for many years. In the 1980's, she worked the cabaret circuit, where she sang many of the songs she had sung in her movies.         In the 1987 film ''Creepshow 2,'' she played a sloppily dressed housewife who gets murdered. ''Well, at my age you can't lean against a palm tree and sing 'Moon of Monakoora,''' she said. ''People would look at that and say, 'What is she trying to do?' ''         While ''Creepshow 2'' was her only film role in two decades, she was frequently seen on television, doing guest shots such shows as ''The Love Boat,'' ''Murder, She Wrote'' and, naturally, a few Bob Hope specials.         She is survived by her two sons, John Ridgley Howard and Tom Howard; a stepson, William Ross Howard 4th; a grandson, and a granddaughter.         Correction:  September 24, 1996, Tuesday         An obituary of the actress Dorothy Lamour yesterday reversed parts of the name of her second husband in some copies. He was William Ross Howard 3d, not William Howard Ross 3d.

         Ludmilla Chiriaeff, the founder of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens of Montreal and a major force in Canadian dance, died on Sunday at a hospital in Montreal. She was 72.         She died of complications from a lung illness, said Catherine Luft Mead, a daughter.         Mme. Chiriaeff developed a major company in a city that knew little about ballet before her arrival there in 1952. Her earliest efforts perplexed straitlaced audiences, and a clergyman once chastised her for showing her legs in public. Mme. Chiriaeff persevered, and, in addition to building a company, she became a pioneer of dance on Canadian television and a leader of Canadian dance education.         Born in Riga, Latvia, of a Russian father and a Polish mother, Mme. Chiriaeff grew up in Berlin, where she received her first ballet lessons. She appeared with Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes, 1936-37, but was considered too young to remain on the company's arduous tours. She danced with the Berlin State Opera Ballet during World War II until Nazi doctors measuring her body decided that she must be Jewish (she was not) and sent her to a labor camp.         After the war she danced with companies in Switzerland, then moved to Montreal with the aid of the International Rescue Committee. Les Ballets Chiriaeff, which she founded in 1952, originally functioned as an ensemble for television, dancing on so many shows that its dancers were nicknamed ''Chiriaeff's grasshoppers,'' perpetually hopping about on the screen.         The group made its stage debut in 1955 and aroused such enthusiasm that Mme. Chiriaeff decided to transform it into a company for Canadian theaters. Renamed Les Grands Ballets Canadiens in 1958, it acquired an eclectic repertory and toured widely. In 1969, when he troupe danced Fernand Nault's ''Symphony of Psalms'' in a Montreal church, many local theatergoers decided that the city no longer found ballet to be morally suspect.         The following year, Mr. Nault, a French-Canadian choreographer, made Les Grands Ballets Canadiens internationally famous with his staging of ''Tommy,'' the rock-opera by the Who.         Mme. Chiriaeff founded l'Academie des Grands Ballets Canadiens in 1958 and l'Ecole Superieure de Danse in 1966, and relinquished the artistic direction of her company in 1974 to devote herself full-time to educational activities. Her many projects ranged from courses for students desiring professional careers to introductory ballet lessons for sixth graders.         Among the honors received by Mme. Chiriaeff are the Governor General's Medal of the Order of Canada, the Governor General's Award for the Performing Arts, the Denise Pelletier Award for the Performing Arts and honorary doctorates from McGill University, the University of Montreal and the University of Quebec. She was named a Companion of the Order of Canada in 1984 and an Officer of the National Order of Quebec in 1985. The City of Montreal proclaimed her a ''Grande Montrealaise (Great Montrealer)'' in 1978, and the headquarters of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens is called La Maison de la Danse Ludmilla Chiriaeff in her honor.         Mme. Chiriaeff was married twice; both marriages ended in divorce. In addition to Ms. Mead, of New York City, she is survived by two other daughters, Anastasia Chiriaeff of Montreal, and Ludmilla Luft Ivanovic of Boston; two sons, Avde Chiriaeff and Gleb Chiriaeff, both of Montreal, and four granddaughters.       
         Mary Ellen Jones, a biochemist whose studies of the components of DNA were part of the foundation of basic cancer research, died on Aug. 23 in Waltham, Mass. She was 73 and had lived in the Boston area for the past year.         Dr. Jones, who was the first woman to head a department in the School of Medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, died of cancer, her family said. She had been treated at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston.         DNA molecules are the building blocks of life, and Dr. Jones's research helped uncover how cells make the building blocks of DNA. She studied enzymes involved in the synthesis of nucleotides, the links in the helical chain that is deoxyribonucleic acid.         ''It was a positive line of investigation with the hope that some kind of cancer therapy would result,'' said Dr. Thomas Traut, a colleague at the university. Unlike normal cells, cancer cells are constantly dividing and thus need to make new DNA all the time. So cutting the supply of DNA components, the thinking went, could be one way to stop the cancer.         Although the enzymes Dr. Jones studied eventually turned out not to hold promise for cancer therapy, several of them ''are still seen as limited targets for a few diseases,'' said Dr. Traut, an associate professor of biochemistry and biophysics. Beyond that, he said, Dr. Jones contributed immensely to a field in its formative stages.         ''Forty years ago, people knew very little about this stuff,'' Dr. Traut said. Although the field expanded greatly in the 1970's, he said, Dr. Jones ''was at the front with a handful of other labs'' in the 1950's, when she did her first major research at the Massachusetts General Hospital.  That work involved the discovery of carbamyl phosphate, one compound in the sequence by which nucleotides are made.         Dr. Jones was born in LaGrange Park, Ill., and earned a bachelor's degree in biochemistry from the University of Chicago in 1944. She did graduate work at Yale University, receiving a doctorate in 1951.         After leaving Massachusetts General in 1957, she was a professor at Brandeis University until 1966. She became an associate professor at North Carolina that year, left in 1971 for a seven-year stint at the University of Southern California and then returned to North Carolina as chairwoman of the department of biochemistry and nutrition at the medical school.         She resigned as chairwoman in 1989, but she remained active in research and teaching until her retirement last year. She was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1984.         Her marriage, to Paul L. Munson, ended in divorce. She is survived by a sister, Anna Mae Dufty, of Pueblo, Colo.; two brothers, George K. Jones, of West Roxbury, Mass., and Elmer E. Jones, of Weston, Mass.; a daughter, Catherine L. Munson, of Fort Mill, S.C.; a son, Ethan V. Munson, of Milwaukee, and one grandchild.       
         Frances Lear, a mercurial figure in the media world who spent some $25 million she received in a divorce settlement to start a magazine named after herself, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         She died of breast cancer, said Dr. Jonathan LaPook, her son-in-law.         Ms. Lear was married for 28 years to Norman Lear, the highly successful television producer of series like ''All in the Family'' and ''Maude.'' Her divorce settlement from Mr. Lear, an amount variously estimated to be between $100 million and $112 million, was one of the largest ever recorded.         ''I was very much a part of his thinking,'' she often said, justifying the amount of the settlement. ''Norman could not have done his shows without me.''         It is generally considered -- and she herself claimed -- that she was the inspiration for Maude, the feisty and opinionated title character played by Bea Arthur.         Ms. Lear made a name for herself among feminists, working in political campaigns, including Eugene McCarthy's Presidential campaign in 1968; with the National Organization for Women on behalf of the Equal Rights Amendment, which was not ratified; as a partner in an executive search firm specializing in placing women, and as a writer, producing articles for a number of national publications. But she believed that she had faded into the background as her husband's career took off in the 1970's. After Mr. Lear acquired his own movie studio and founded his own civil liberties group, People for the American Way, she discussed her frustrations in an Op-Ed piece in The New York Times in 1981.         A woman in Hollywood is a nonperson, she wrote, ''unless she is under 21, powerful or a star.'' She noted, too, that an industry wife was looked through, never at. In a later interview, recalling her years as a Hollywood wife, she said she had felt constantly ignored and undervalued, had had little self-esteem and had often been depressed.         Ms. Lear, in her own words, ''always aspired to something out of the ordinary,'' and she moved to New York after her divorce in 1985. She quickly set out to change the nonperson identity she had felt in Hollywood by creating Lear's, a magazine aimed at women like herself -- ''the woman who wasn't born yesterday,'' as the magazine said on its cover.         Lear's began publication in 1988 and was a success. It began with a circulation base of 250,000 and grew to 350,000 in a year. But after two years, Ms. Lear abandoned her original concept and lowered the age of the theoretical Lear's woman to over 35. Abandoning the older-age niche put the magazine into competition with other women's magazines, and its advertising never recovered from the move.         Almost immediately after the magazine's debut, Ms. Lear developed a reputation for being unpredictable and hot-tempered. She held a series of intimate lunches in her apartment during which she sought, and then usually ignored, advice for her fledgling publication. She also frequently brought up more of her personal history than most of her guests were prepared for, revealing that she had a Dickensian childhood, that doctors had determined that she was manic-depressive and had prescribed lithium for her condition, that she was an alcoholic and that she had made several suicide attempts over the years.         There ensued a revolving door of editors and writers, many of whom complained of Ms. Lear's inexperience and capricious decisions. Numerous articles were accepted and not published, and layouts were changed at the last minute. In an article in The New York Times, a staff member recalled that when Ms. Lear had been told that she could not change a quotation, she had shouted, ''It is my magazine, and I will do what I want.''         A former associate once said of her, ''She spent her life in Hollywood, where you go on your gut and you are prized for being slightly nuts.'' Ms. Lear did not deny the validity of the remark. She had lived with that behavior for many years, she said, and ''very possibly some of it rubbed off.''         Although circulation was more than 500,000 in its final months, Lear's ceased publication in March 1994. It had lost an estimated $25 million to $30 million in its six years of operation.         Ms. Lear then formed Lear Television, investing $500,000 in a video production company. The videos, which she referred to as ''television books,'' were specifically for women and dealt with subjects like personal finances and relationships. She had also just completed a book, ''Frances Lear's Guide to Work and Family in the 21st Century,'' which does not yet have a publisher.         Ms. Lear was born on July 14, 1923, at the Vanderheusen Home for Wayward Girls in Hudson, N.Y., the child of an unwed mother and an unknown father. ''The odds were stacked high against me,'' she once said. She was given the name Evelyn, but she was renamed Frances when she was adopted after 14 months in an orphanage by Aline and Herbert Loeb of Larchmont, N.Y.         ''Aline was outwardly affectionate with me for my father's sake, but she did not like me,'' Ms. Lear wrote in ''The Second Seduction,'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1992) an autobiography that pulled no punches. The slim volume laid out in harrowing detail her personal history and most intimate experiences.         The memoir related her years of sexual abuse, beginning at age 12, by the man whom her adoptive mother married after Mr. Loeb committed suicide during the Depression. She told, too, of being sent to a psychiatrist, to whom she revealed her stepfather's abuse, and of the psychiatrist's betrayal in repeating her confidences to her mother and stepfather. Her stepfather, she wrote, ''met me at the door with a kitchen knife in his hand.'' Her mother ''turned and left the room, went into her bedroom, closed the door and protected her economic hide.'' On her mother's death, her stepfather was left 90 percent of the $100,000 remaining from Mr. Loeb's insurance, Ms. Lear said.         Ms. Lear attended the Mary A. Burnham School for Girls in Northampton, Mass. In the 1940's and early 50's, she held a number of jobs, primarily in advertising and retailing in New York. She was, she never hesitated to say, dismissed from most of them for behavior like listening in on the boss's telephone conversations and drinking through lunch.         For a brief period, she was the camera girl at the Copacabana nightclub in New York. The job ended when she asked Frank Costello, the camera-shy gangster, whether he would like to have his picture taken. Her boss grabbed her under her armpits, lifted her into the air, carried her into the street, set her down, kissed her goodbye and advised her to try another line of work.         Ms. Lear had two short-lived marriages before she met Mr. Lear. Her first marriage, to Arnold Weiss, a traffic manager at the Navy Yard in Charleston, S.C., lasted less than two years. Her second marriage, to Morton Kaufman (''or Kauffman or Kaufmann -- I cannot remember how to spell my second husband's name,'' she wrote in the autobiography), was dissolved within a year. She said that he had been unfaithful, leading to her first suicide attempt and three weeks in the psychiatric ward at Bellevue Hospital.         ''I tried to commit suicide three times seriously and three times with minimal interest in the outcome,'' she once said.         She was 33 and a buyer for better active sportswear at Lord & Taylor when she married Mr. Lear, who was then a television writer, and moved to California. She turned down a buyer's job with a Los Angeles store and concentrated on homemaking and rearing her two daughters.         One day, she recalled, she realized that ''we had become he.'' She began to think seriously of leaving her marriage. It took her 15 years, she said, ''to work up the courage.''         ''I believe the second half of one's life is meant to be better than the first half,'' she said in an interview last year. ''It is certainly true of me.''         Ms. Lear is survived by her two daughters, Maggie Beth Lear and Kate Breckir Lear (who is married to Dr. LaPook), both of Manhattan, and two grandsons.       
         Laura La Plante, an early screen star who made the transition from silent screams to audible sobs and songs, died on Monday at the Motion Picture and Television Fund Hospital in Los Angeles. She was 92.         In a career in which she appeared in some 75 films, many in the silent era, Miss La Plante was cast primarily as a comedian but demonstrated considerable dramatic range.         If a villain needed a heroine to tie to the railroad tracks in the face of an onrushing train, for example, Miss La Plante could be counted on to wriggle and squirm convincingly until the hero rescued her in the nick of time.         Perhaps her most famous role was as the heroine in the 1927 silent classic, ''The Cat and the Canary,'' still studied as the progenitor of the English manor house movie thriller, in this case with flashes of comedy.         She also became something of a footnote to Hollywood history as the first woman to sing on screen when she was actually heard singing and sobbing in the original film version of ''Show Boat,'' in 1929.         The daughter of a Missouri farmer with an ear for alliteration, Miss La Plante, who was born on a farm outside St. Louis, really was given that unlikely name at birth, almost. The original version of La Plante, her son explained yesterday, had no ''e'' at the end, but she added one, without prompting by studio executives, after friends pointed out it needed a proper feminine French ending to go with the ''La.''         At a time when movie acting was not regarded as entirely respectable, Miss La Plante, who came to Hollywood with her schoolteacher mother after her parents' divorce, got her first job on a lark, winning a role as an extra at the age of 15.         Within two years, she had won a contract from Universal and was well on her way to becoming one of the most famous women in America, appearing first in Hoot Gibson westerns and the like and then in leading roles opposite Reginald Denny, especially after the director William Seitzer persuaded her to bob and bleach her long brown hair.         She and Mr. Seitzer were married in 1926 and divorced in 1932, three months before Miss La Plante, who had been making a movie in London, married Irving Asher, a producer who had been running the Warner Brothers studio in London.         For all the bride's movie star fame, the couple were upstaged at their wedding by their official witness, Mr. Asher's pal, the former New York City Mayor, James J. Walker.         The next year, while Miss La Plante was staying at Mr. Walker's thatched-roof cottage in Surrey, the house burned to the ground, destroying all the papers and documents he had accumulated during his two years in office before resigning under a cloud in 1932.         Although there were some sniggling suggestions that the papers, at least, had been deliberately torched to hide evidence of the former Mayor's suspected corruption, Miss La Plante's son insisted that the fire had been entirely accidental. Indeed, he said, when his mother, who was ill in bed at the time and eventually had to be carried to safety out a window, was told by a maid that ''the thatch is alight, Mum,'' she shrugged off the news, thinking merely that a cozy fire had been started in the fireplace.         Miss La Plante largely retired from the screen after her marriage, making only a few movies after that while becoming a somewhat offbeat Hollywood hostess.         When friends like William Holden or Hal Wallis came to dine, Mr. Asher inevitably did the cooking, while Miss La Plante, who had learned the art in London from Somerset Maugham's wife, Syrie, wowed the guests with her stunning flower arrangements.         Miss La Plante, whose husband died in 1985, is survived by a daughter, Jill Murray of Mill Valley, Calif.; a son, Tony Asher of Los Angeles, and a grandson.         Correction:  October 22, 1996, Tuesday         An obituary of the actress Laura La Plante on Thursday misspelled the surname of her first husband. He was William Seiter.       
         Arlene Wanderman, an editor and public relations executive who was the American spokeswoman for the International Olive Oil Council, died on Monday at Beth Israel North Hospital. She was 60 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause has not been determined, said Linda Russo, an associate.         In 1990, Ms. Wanderman founded Foodcom, a public relations company in Manhattan that specializes in food, wine and cooking equipment. The company's major account is the International Olive Oil Council, a nonprofit educational and promotional agency supported by the governments of many Mediterranean countries, which also set standards for olive oil.         Her career in food started at the Macfadden Group as women's service editor for such magazines as True Story, True Confessions and Photoplay. She then became the food and equipment editor of Ladies' Home Journal before embarking on a career in advertising and public relations.         Ms. Wanderman, a native of Brooklyn, graduated from Cornell University and had a degree in metabolic dietetics from New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center.         Her marriages to Bob Reiter of Boca Raton, Fla., and Philip L. Wanderman of White Plains, both ended in divorce.         She is survived by her son, James K. Reiter of Hollywood, Fla.; her mother, Edith Rosenwasser of Boca Raton, Fla., and her brother, Stan Rosenwasser of Rehobeth Beach, Del.       
         Virginia Cherrill, a 1930's actress who starred as a beautiful, blind flower girl in the classic Charlie Chaplin silent film ''City Lights'' (1931), died late Thursday in a hospital in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 88 and had settled in Santa Barbara in 1950.         Miss Cherrill was born near Carthage, Ill. and educated at schools in Kenosha, Wis., and Chicago.         After an early marriage to Irving Adler, a Chicago lawyer, ended in divorce, she went to California to recover and met Chaplin there. He has variously been said to have first noticed her on a California beach and when they were both at a boxing match.         David Robinson, film critic for The Times of London, wrote in a 1985 biography of Chaplin that the actor gave Miss Cherrill the part of the flower girl largely because she portrayed a blind person appealingly, in a test, after he advised her to look at him but ''to look inwardly and not to see me.''         In the movie, Chaplin starred opposite her as a little tramp who fell in love with her. Its final scene, with close-ups of Miss Cherrill, has won special praise. The writer and critic James Agee called it ''enough to shrivel the heart to see, the greatest piece of acting and the highest moment in movies.''         Miss Cherrill starred in several other American-made movies in the early 1930's and met Cary Grant at a film premiere. They were married in 1933, and she went on to retire briefly from movie making.         Their divorce came in 1935. Then she resumed her career, again briefly, in Britain, where she acted in two films. Later she said, ''I was no great shakes as an actress.''         She retired from movie making for good when she began her nine-year marriage to the ninth Earl of Jersey, in 1937.         As the Countess of Jersey, she did charity work in Britain during World War II.         She is survived by her husband of 48 years, Florian Martini, a World War II flying ace.       
         Elaine Anthony, a painter who specialized in lush semi-abstract landscapes, died on Oct. 26 at her home in West Redding, Conn. She was 53 years old.         The cause was cancer, her family said         Ms. Anthony was born in New York City, where her father, Jack Murray Anthony, was a cartoonist for The New Yorker and art director at Young & Rubicam. After earning an undergraduate degree from Stephens College in Columbia, Mo., she studied art at the Rhode Island School of Design.         In 1964, she married a Spanish architect, Pedro Sanchez de Move llan, and spent much of the next 20 years living in Mexico City, where her husband worked for the firm of Luis Barragan.         Ms. Anthony began her artistic career making wire sculptures, cloth banners and paintings on cloth, often executed as commissions for Mexican resorts. Her work matured to semi-abstract landscapes and collages, often executed in a loose painterly style.         She had her first Manhattan solo show in 1987, at the Stephen Haller Gallery in SoHo, and her first retrospective last winter, at the Neuberger Museum in Purchase, N.Y.         Exhibitions of her work are on view at the Tremaine Gallery at the Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Conn., and the Stephen Haller Gallery.         Ms. Anthony's marriage ended in divorce in 1982. In 1991 she married Bernard Wharton.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her twin sister, the artist Carol Anthony of Sante Fe, N.M.; her brother, Jack M. Anthony of Seattle, and three children from her first marriage, Pedro Sanchez de Move llan of Middletown, R.I., Tessa Wohl of Stockbridge, Mass., and Mark Sanchez de Movellan of Hilversum, the Netherlands.       
         Louise Bates Ames, a psychologist whose pioneering work on children held that development unfolded in discrete, predictable stages, died last Thursday at her granddaughter's home in Cincinnati. She was 88 and lived in New Haven until shortly before her death.         The cause was cancer, said Jacqueline I. Haines, director of the Gesell Institute in New Haven, which Dr. Ames helped found in 1950.         Working in the 1930's and 40's with Frances L. Ilg and Arnold Gesell, and then later at the institute named in Dr. Gesell's honor, Dr. Ames developed the thesis that ages have patterned, predictable behavior. Thus, at about 2 1/2 years old, for example, children tend to become inflexible and rigid; the result is the ''terrible 2's,'' a term they helped popularize.         The idea that children develop in stages and that parents and doctors should pay attention to them was quite important in its time, said Dr. Sidney M. Baker, who headed the institute from 1978 to 1985. ''Now we know about these things, and it doesn't seem so surprising,'' he said.         But the work was later criticized as being too inflexible and too tied to the idea that a child's development is set in stone by genetics. ''People would talk about Gesell testing as if they were saying all 4-year-olds should be the same,'' Dr. Baker said.         In reality, the researchers thought just the opposite; they used their testing and research techniques ''as a measure of individuality, not conformity,'' he said.         Dr. Ames's greatest impact, Dr. Baker said, was in educating parents and teachers about the rhythms of child development. She was a prolific writer, and her work included a syndicated newspaper column with Dr. Ilg and co-authorship of several best-selling books; among them, ''Child Behavior'' (published in 1981 and reissued by Harper Perennial in 1992) is still popular. She also developed several television series on child development, including one in the early days of television, in 1952.         Louise Bates was born in Portland, Me., and received bachelor's and master's degrees from the University of Maine. In 1933, she joined the  Yale Clinic of Child Development, working as Dr. Gesell's research assistant. She received her Ph.D. from Yale in 1937, studying how infants make the transition to crawling, or ''prone procession.''         When Dr. Gesell retired in 1948, the direction of the clinic changed toward a more psychoanalytic view of child development, Dr. Haines said. Dr. Ames and Dr. Ilg moved up the hill from the campus and founded the Gesell Institute, unaffiliated with the university, to continue their research.         That research consisted largely of filming children as they played or did certain tasks. Dr. Ames and the others compiled hundreds of hours of films, later studying them in minute detail.         It was cinema of a different sort that caused trouble for Dr. Ames in the mid-1980's, when she was criticized for suggesting in a newspaper interview that parents should not take young children to see the Disney film ''Bambi,'' in which the young deer's mother is killed by hunters.         ''I think this is one of any child's greatest fears, that something will happen to his mother,'' Dr. Ames said in a later interview, defending her position. She recommended that any parent who felt compelled to take a child under age 5 to see the movie should read the book to the child first, to gauge the reaction. ''And I would then wait a few days,'' she advised, ''because sometimes a child cries uncontrollably at the time, and sometimes they seem to stand something O.K. and then they start having nightmares.''         Dr. Ames's marriage to Smith Ames, a medical doctor, in the 1930's ended in divorce.         In addition to her granddaughter, Carol Haber, she is survived by a brother, Silas Bates of Philadelphia; a grandson, Clifford Chase, who lives in Ohio, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Diane Margo Morales, special assistant for families and children to the Manhattan Borough President, Ruth W. Messinger, died on Nov. 1 at New York Hospital. She was 52 and  lived in Park Slope, Brooklyn.         She suffered a long illness, her office reported.         Ms. Morales advised Ms. Messinger on social affairs like domestic violence, homelessness and women's issues.         She graduated from City College and received a master's degree from the Hunter College School of Social Work and a master's in urban affairs from Yale University and Occidental College. Over the years, she worked for the Community Service Society, the State Department of Social Services, the city's Human Resources Administration and the Ryan Community Health Center in Manhattan.         She was a former chairwoman of Community School Board No. 3 and  was active on Community Board No. 7 on the Upper West Side, where she lived for many years. Working out of the Borough President's office, she devised and coordinated various social projects like Iris House, a center for women with AIDS.         Ms. Morales is survived by a daughter, Alexandra Morales of Brooklyn, and her mother, Nancy Salamo, and sister, Linda Salamo, both of El Cerrito, Calif. Her marriage to Charles Morales ended in divorce.       
         Somaya Fahmy, a pioneer of clinical psychology in Egypt and a women's rights advocate who developed literacy programs for rural Arab villages, died in Cairo on Nov. 29. She was 86.         Dr. Fahmy, a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Ain Shams in Cairo for many years, was a founder of the Egyptian Psychological Association and its president from 1972 to 1981.         She studied at the University of London and received a doctorate in psychology from Indiana University in 1953. She also practiced psychology in Geneva.         Dr. Fahmy, born in Mansura, Egypt, in 1910 to a family prominent in medicine, was trained as a teacher before turning to psychology. In an early experiment, she began a literacy campaign in the Nile delta and wrote about the improvements in the lives of village women.         Her marriage to Hussein Fawzi ended in divorce. She is survived by two sons, Dr. Hussein Fawzi, a physician in Scotland, and Ahmad Fawzi, deputy spokesman for the Secretary General of the United Nations in New York.       
         Joan Hartman-Goldsmith, an art historian and writer known for her expertise in Chinese works, especially jade, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 63.         The cause was colon cancer, her family said.         At her death Mrs. Goldsmith was the director of the Institute for Asian Studies on East 44th Street, which she founded in 1981 as a school for adult education. Its lecture programs cover a wide range of historical and contemporary subjects pertaining to Asia.         She also was a member of the art committee of the China Institute in America, which has its headquarters on East 65th Street. She established the institute's art gallery and helped in its work for nearly three decades.         She contributed numerous articles and book reviews to art publications and also wrote about jade and Chinese art for the general reader. Her most recent book was ''Chinese Jade,'' published in 1986 by Oxford University Press in Hong Kong.         Born Joan Lederman in Malden, Mass., she graduated from George Washington High School in Manhattan. She studied Chinese art on her own for 10 years and started a career at the China Institute and the School for Continuing Education at New York University. In the 1970's she worked as an administrator at the Jewish Museum in Manhattan.         Mrs. Goldsmith made 13 trips to China, most recently in June. She lectured at the Cooper-Hewitt Institute of Design as well as other museums and institutes across the country and abroad.         A marriage to Alan Hartman ended in divorce.         Mrs. Goldsmith is survived by her husband, Robert L. Goldsmith; a daughter, Hedy Hartman of St. George, S.I.; and a sister, Louisa Lubar of Newton Centre, Mass.       
         Mary Leakey, matriarch of the famous fossil-hunting family in Africa whose own reputation in paleoanthropology soared with discoveries of bones, stone tools and the footprints of early human ancestors, died yesterday in Nairobi, Kenya. She was 83.         Her family announced her death but did not give the cause, saying only that she died peacefully.         Over half a century, Mary Leakey labored under the hot African sun, scratching in the dirt for clues to early human physical and cultural evolution. Scientists in her field said she set the standards for documentation and excavation in paleolithic archeology. They spoke of hers as a life of enviable achievement.         ''She was one of the world's great originals,'' said Dr. Alan Walker, an anatomist at Pennsylvania State University who has long excavated fossils with the Leakey family. ''Untrained except in art, she developed techniques of excavation and descriptive archeology and did it all on her own in the middle of Africa. It was an extraordinary life.''         In a biography of the Leakey family, ''Ancestral Passions,'' published last year by Simon & Schuster, Virginia Morell characterized Mary Leakey as ''the grande dame of archeology.''         Beginning in the 1930's, Mary Leakey and her late husband, Louis, awakened the world to Africa's primary place in human origins with their spectacular discoveries and increasingly pushed back the time of those origins much earlier than had been thought. Until then, many scientists still believed the human birthplace would be found in Asia.         She discovered the skull of Proconsul africanus, an apelike ancestor of both apes and early humans that lived about 25 million years ago. In 1959, her discovery of a well-preserved skull of a hominid, a member of the extended human ancestral family, brought fame and substantial financial backing to the Leakeys. A few years later, the two Leakeys uncovered the fossils of the first known member of the genus Homo habilis, or ''able man,'' in recognition of the many stone tools found among the bones.         From then on, the name Leakey was synonymous with the study of human origins. The flamboyant Louis seemed to know just where to look to find revealing fossils; the envious spoke of ''Leakey's luck.'' Meanwhile, Mary Leakey worked in her husband's shadow, seeing to the plodding excavations and meticulous documentation of their finds.         ''Louis was always a better publicist than scientist,'' said E. Barton Worthington, a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in London and former African explorer. ''Mary was the real fossil hunter.''         After Louis Leakey's death in 1972, Mary Leakey overcame some of her natural shyness to assume direction of the family fossil enterprise, which by then one of their sons, Richard, joined as an expedition leader. Her operations centered on Olduvai Gorge and Laetoli, both in Tanzania. On the arid plain of Laetoli, she made her most sensational discovery in 1978: the earliest footprints of a human ancestor.         A Playful Moment, But a Fateful One         As often happens, the discovery of the prints was made by chance -- more Leakey luck. While tossing dried elephant dung in a playful camp fight, one scientist on Mrs. Leakey's expedition fell down and saw in the gray surface some curious indentations. They were imprints of raindrops and animals, now hardened to stone and recently exposed by erosion and weathering.         After further exploration, scientists determined that the tracks were made about 3.7 million years ago. The animals had walked over volcanic ash when it was damp from rain, leaving impressions of their feet. The wet ash set like concrete and was later covered over by more ash and silt. There the tracks remained to be found by dung-throwing scientists.         It was two years before a scientist uncovered a heel print that hinted of an even more significant find. It seemed to belong to a hominid. On Aug. 2, 1978, Mrs. Leakey spent three hours examining one of the clearest of these prints. She cleaned the crevices of the print with a small brush and dental pick. All the important elements were preserved: heel, toes and arch. She appraised the print from every possible angle.         Finally, Mrs. Leakey stood up from her work, lit a cigar and announced, ''Now this really is something to put on the mantelpiece.''         She was at last sure that a hominid had left this print and a trail of prints extending more than 75 feet across the plain. Two and possibly three individuals had walked this way 3.7 million years ago: the larger one, presumably a male; the smaller one, presumably female, and an even smaller individual, perhaps their child, whose prints are sometimes superimposed on the others.         In a Footprint a Clue To Human Behavior         Somewhere along the way, as Mrs. Leakey noted, the female appeared to pause and turn to her left. She might have sensed danger, possibly from a predator or the rumble of a volcanic eruption nearby. Then she resumed her walk to the north.         ''This motion, so intensely human, transcends time,'' Mrs. Leakey wrote in the National Geographic magazine. ''A remote ancestor -- just as you or I -- experienced a moment of doubt.''         These evocative footprints are the earliest known traces of human behavior. At the time, the discovery established that human ancestors had begun walking upright much earlier than previously thought, long before the evolution of larger brains. Whether upright walking preceded the larger brain, or vice versa, was still a much-debated issue among scholars.         With the discovery of a species called Australopithecus afarensis, based on the famous Lucy skeleton, the most likely identity of these prehistoric strollers was established. The species lived between 3.9 million and 3 million years ago, and from the fossils paleontologists have determined that they were as capable of walking upright as modern humans.         ''I think it's the most important find in view of human evolution,'' Mrs. Leakey was quoted by The Associated Press as saying in an interview in September. ''I was really looking for tools, but we never found any at the site.''         In Stone Age Art, Two Interests Merged         She also looked back fondly on what she called another highlight of her career. She was a budding artist before she met and later married Mr. Leakey, when she turned to fossil hunting and archeology. In 1951, her two interests merged briefly.         Mrs. Leakey recorded on drawing paper some 1,600 of the thousands of late Stone Age paintings in the Kondoa-Irangi region of Tanzania. The work gave her ''a great sense of happiness and well-being,'' she wrote in her autobiography, ''Disclosing the Past,'' published in 1984, because the drawings afforded a glimpse of the lives of the hunter-gatherers who painted them. ''No amounts of stone and bone could yield the kinds of information that the paintings gave so freely,'' she said.         One of her last books was a collection of these Stone Age drawings, entitled ''Africa's Vanishing Art: the Rock Paintings of Tanzania'' and published in 1983.         Art and, to some extent, prehistory were part of Mary Leakey's heritage. She was born Mary Douglas Nicol on Feb. 6, 1913 in London. Her father, Erskine Nicol, was a prolific and fairly successful landscape painter, as was his father before him. Her mother, Cecilia Marion Frere, was a descendant of John Frere, a British prehistorian who in 1797 first recognized Stone Age flint implements as primitive tools and weapons.         After World War I, the family spent months each year in Switzerland, France or Italy, where the father painted and took Mary to archeological ruins and the caves painted by Cro-Magnon hunters. As she said, this was the source of her early interest in archeology.         ''Basically, I have been compelled by curiosity,'' she wrote in her autobiography. But formal education was not for her.         Bored by class work and her fellow students, Mary was expelled from two schools and so, with attending a university out of the question, decided to pursue independent studies in drawing and archeology. ''I had never passed a single school exam, and clearly never would,'' she wrote.         At the age of 20, Mary Nicol, a sometime illustrator of stone tools and occasional participant in archeological digs, met Louis Leakey, 10 years her senior, married and an established figure in African archeology with a position at Cambridge University. He asked her to help him with drawings for a book, and she readily agreed. A romance followed, and then scandal.         Scandal in Cambridge Led to Magic of Africa         They would marry as soon as his divorce came through. Meanwhile, they did nothing to conceal the intimacy of their relationship, living together for more than a year in a cottage near Cambridge. This eventually cost him his post at Cambridge, the memory of which was dancing lightly through Mary Leakey's mind years later as she walked up the aisle at Cambridge to receive an honorary doctorate degree.         The two were married in 1936 and set out for Africa, where he had grown up as the son of British missionaries. As Mrs. Leakey wrote later, she was never the same again after ''Africa had cast its spell'' on her. Much of their marriage was spent at dig sites. ''Given the chance, I'd rather be in a tent than in a house,'' she said in a recent interview with Associated Press.         It was a discovery by the Leakeys in 1959 that, according to Dr. F. Clark Howell of the University of California at Berkeley, marked ''the beginnings of paleoanthropology in a modern sense.'' The pace of exploration quickened. Geologists and anatomists joined the quest, a multidisciplinary approach that the Leakeys did much to promote.         On a July day in 1959, as Louis lay ill in camp, Mary stumbled on some teeth and part of a jaw on a slope of Olduvai Gorge. Rushing back to her husband, she exclaimed, ''I've found him -- found our man.''         How the couple celebrated is not recorded. But in her autobiography, Mrs. Leakey wrote that after an earlier major find they ''cast aside care'' and that was how their son Philip ''came to join our family.''         The 1959 discovery turned out to be a 1.8 million-year-old fossil known as the ''nutcracker man'' because of its huge jaws and molar teeth. It was later designated Australopithecus boisei.         As Two Lives Diverged, A New Independence         From 1968 until Louis Leakey's death in 1972, he and Mary Leakey were separated. He spent more and more of his time in the celebrity whirl, raising money and lecturing,  while she stuck to her digging at Olduvai. She was becoming more independent, opposing some of her husband's more sensational interpretations of discoveries.         ''I ended by losing my professional respect for Louis; and it had been very great indeed,'' she wrote. ''Once that was so I was no longer able to offer the concurrence and unquestioning adulation he now seemed to demand.''         Another unsettling episode in her life was the controversy between her and Richard Leakey, on one side, and Dr. Donald C. Johanson, the discoverer of Lucy, on the other. She insisted on the removal of her name from the joint authorship of a paper that made assumptions about the place of the Lucy species human evolution.         Mrs. Leakey retired from fieldwork in 1983, still smoking small Cuban cigars and accompanied by her beloved Dalmatians. Her honors were many for a woman who never finished high school: medals from the National Geographic Society, the Geological Society of London and the Royal Swedish Academy and many honorary degrees.         She is survived by her three sons, Jonathan, Richard and Philip, all of Kenya, and by 10 grandchildren.       
         Helen Wilson, a staunch advocate of patients' rights as administrator for the Association of the Attending Staff at Mount Sinai Medical Center, died yesterday at the hospital. Mrs. Wilson, who lived on the Upper East Side, was 82.         The cause was cancer, a daughter, Victoria Wilson, said.         Working with the practicing physicians at Mount Sinai for more than 20 years, Mrs. Wilson was a champion of better patient care and increased respect for nurses.         Mrs. Wilson retired in 1984. At the time, she held the titles of secretary to the medical board, secretary to the board of trustees and head of the medical staff services office, in addition to that of administrator for the Association  of the Attending Staff.         The Association of the Attending Staff persuaded Mrs. Wilson to stay on, and  she continued as the organization's administrator until her death.         Mrs. Wilson joined Mount Sinai in 1962 as administrative assistant to the director of nurses. After a few years, she left briefly to work as a theater producer, but she returned in the late 60's and remained.         Mrs. Wilson was born in Manhattan and educated at the Dalton School, the University of Wisconsin and Hunter College.         Always an activist, she was involved in anti-Fascist causes during the Spanish Civil War, supported Russian War Relief and was often seen on picket lines.         In the early 1950's, after her marriage to the novelist and physicist Mitchell Wilson, which was to end in divorce, the couple lived on Martha's Vineyard for several years.         At that time, Mrs. Wilson gave up her work as administrative assistant to the president of the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, and with her husband founded the Martha's Vineyard Little Theater, where they produced and directed plays.         In addition to her daughter Victoria, of Manhattan, Mrs. Wilson is survived by another daughter, Erica Silverman, also of Manhattan.       
         Josephine Patterson Albright, who flew the mail, shot tigers in India, covered Chicago crime in journalism's colorful "Front Page" era, ran an Illinois dairy and pig farm, bred horses in Wyoming, wrote a column about her family and  helped establish a foundation for journalists, died on Monday at her home in Woodstock, Vt. She was 82.         A daughter, Alice Arlen of Manhattan, said the death was caused by complications after a stroke.         Mrs. Albright was a member of one of the most prominent families in American journalism. Her father, Joseph Medill Patterson, founded The Daily News in New York and helped found The Chicago Tribune. Her aunt, Eleanor Medill Patterson, published The Washington Times-Herald, and her older sister, Alicia Patterson, founded, published and edited Newsday.         Like Alicia, who was seven years her senior, Josephine was told by her father that journalism was not for women. Both proved him wrong.         When Josephine earned her spurs in Chicago in the early 1930's, interviewing  killers like George (Baby Face) Nelson and covering murders and the criminal courts, she worked not for her father's newspaper but for a rival paper, The Chicago Daily News, whose staff members served as models for the characters in the classic Ben Hecht-Charles MacArthur comedy "The Front Page."         In "Ladies of the Press" (Harper & Brothers, 1936), Ishbel Ross wrote, "She sailed along successfully under her own steam, in spite of the professional handicap of being born into a noted newspaper family."         Josephine Patterson was born in Libertyville, Ill., on Dec. 2, 1913, and educated at the Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Va. Although her father disapproved of women in journalism, he did approve of women as pilots, and she got her pilot's license at the age of 16. Before her 18th birthday, she was the  youngest pilot flying the mail route between Chicago and St. Louis.         But Josephine's career as a commercial mail pilot lasted only a few months. At 18, in the midst of her debutante party, she decided to fly with Alicia to India to hunt tigers. Without telling their mother, the two young women hopscotched their way across the world, dancing every night.         When they arrived in India, Josephine, who was later to become an ardent animal rights activist and naturalist, quickly bagged a tiger.         Alicia, who was supposed to shoot the tiger, was angry. She told her sister to stay out of the next hunt. So Josephine went on the next hunt carrying only a book. She was sitting in a tree reading when a leopard bounded up behind her. Josephine threw the book and hit the leopard in the nose. Alicia finished it off.         In 1936, Josephine married Jay Frederick Reeve, a Chicago lawyer she met while covering the courts. At that time she operated a dairy and pig farm that became the Hawthorne-Melody Dairy, a major Illinois enterprise.         In the mid-1940's, after a divorce, she moved to Dubois, Wyo., bought a stallion from an Indian reservation and began raising horses.         In 1946, in Red Lodge, Mont., she married Ivan Albright, an artist of the Chicago school who was known for his realistic paintings. The couple traveled extensively, and Mrs. Albright's travels fostered her enthusiasm for geography.  Near the end of her life, she sponsored a statewide geography bee that was held  in every Vermont school district.         In 1949, Mrs. Albright returned to journalism for three years as the author of a weekly Newsday column, "Life With Junior," which chronicled her foibles and successes in rearing her four children.         In 1963, she and her husband moved to Woodstock, where she obtained a bachelor of arts degree from Goddard College in Plainfield, Vt.         Mr. Albright, whose centennial is to be observed next year with retrospectives at the Art Institute of Chicago and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, died in 1983.         After Alicia Patterson died in 1963, Mrs. Albright helped establish and became a major benefactor of the Alicia Patterson Foundation, which awards fellowships to print journalists and photographers.         Mrs. Albright was also a supporter of the Pentangle Theater in Woodstock, the River City Arts and White River Opera House in White River Junction, Vt., the Hood Museum in Hanover, N.H., and the Art Institute of Chicago. Dartmouth College named her a Lathrop Fellow in honor of her support for its arts collection.         Besides her daughter Alice, Mrs. Albright is survived by another daughter, Dinah Albright Rojek of South Woodstock, Vt.; two sons, Joseph Medill Patterson  Albright of Moscow and Adam Medill Albright of Richmond, Mass., 10 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren.       
         Marcia Davenport, a biographer of Mozart and best-selling novelist, died on Tuesday in a hospital in Monterey, Calif. She was 92 and lived in Pebble Beach,  Calif.         Mrs. Davenport's last book was her autobiography, "Too Strong for Fantasy" (1967). In a review in The New York Times Book Review, Ellen Moers called it "a  compelling production" and said "the gift for old-fashioned, unadulterated romance which made several of her novels best sellers (and one a Greer Garson movie) does not fail her now." Mrs. Davenport did little writing after the 1970's.         Her best-known book is her biography "Mozart," which came out in 1932, and has been continuously in print since then, most recently from the University of  Pittsburgh Press.         When it appeared, Herbert Gorman praised it highly in The New York Times Book Review, writing that Mrs. Davenport "gives a vivid and convincing portrait of the child prodigy who developed into the man-genius, a portrait that does not romanticize Mozart too much and leaves the reader convinced of the reality of the figure with whom he has passed through a career of hard work, poverty, neglect and few (but astounding) triumphs."         Mrs. Davenport's best-known work of fiction was her best-selling 1942 novel "Valley of Decision," which covers the years 1873 to 1941 and focuses on Mary Rafferty, who comes into the lives of the Scott family of Pittsburgh, owners of the Scott Iron Works, as a maid. The book also weaves the Scotts' personal lives in with steel-industry and United States history. The book was made into a 1945 film, with the same title, starring Greer Garson and Gregory Peck.         Another of Mrs. Davenport's best-selling novels, "East Side, West Side" (1947), was one of the last works inspired and edited by Maxwell Perkins of Scribner's publishing house. The novel concerned a woman in Manhattan's high society whose marriage is threatened by her husband's infidelities. The 1949 film adaptation starred Barbara Stanwyck, James Mason and Ava Gardner.         Mrs. Davenport's first novel, "Of Lena Geyer" (1936), was recalled by one reviewer in the 1980's as a "a vivid portrayal of a great opera singer." Her last novel was "The Constant Image" (1960), which described an extramarital affair in Milan.         Her autobiography has vivid descriptions of music, even of the acoustics in Carnegie Hall years ago. In that book, she praises one particular box on the second tier at Carnegie Hall, saying "Carnegie Hall is glorious," but "nowhere else in the old house is the sonority so total, the instruments, together or individually, so brilliant and penetrating. The sound comes out of the walls and surrounds one like a cloak."         Marcia Gluck Davenport was a native New Yorker. In various biographical accounts, she refrained from giving her father's name. Her mother, Alma Gluck, rose from humble origins to fame as a soprano.         Mrs. Davenport wrote in her autobiography that her parents, whose marriage ended in divorce, "were part of the tidal wave of emigration from the Russian Pale and Eastern Europe which in a generation swept a million people, fleeing persecutions, pogroms and conscriptions, onto the shores of Manhattan Island."         Her mother later married the violinist Efrem Zimbalist. Young Marcia went to  private schools in Pennsylvania and attended Wellesley College. She was on the staff of The New Yorker from 1928 to 1931 before becoming a freelance lecturer,  music critic and commentator as well as an author.         Mrs. Davenport's first marriage, to Frank D. Clarke, ended in divorce, as did her 1929 marriage to Russell Wheeler Davenport, a novelist who became a prominent editor at Time Inc.         She is survived by a daughter, Cornelia Davenport Schwartz of Harrisville, N.H., six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Helena Leigh-Hunt, a realist still-life painter, died on Dec. 28 at Southampton Hospital in Long Island. She was 64 and had homes in Sag Harbor and  Claverack, N.Y.         The cause was emphysema, according to her family.         Ms. Leigh-Hunt was born in Paris, the daughter of the French poet and novelist Louise de Vilmorin and the American entrepreneur Henry Leigh-Hunt. She  studied at the American School of Commercial Art in San Francisco, the Art Students League in New York and the Academie Julian in Paris.         Over the years she had exhibitions in several galleries on the East Coast, including the Maxwell-Davidson Gallery in Manhattan and the Elaine Benson Gallery in Bridgehampton, L.I.         Ms. Leigh-Hunt's marriage to John Tracy Baxter ended in divorce.         She is survived by her companion, Mihail Chemiakin, of Claverack; three daughters, Elizabeth Baxter and Etienne Baxter, both of Paris, and Leigh Warre,  of Brooklyn; and a grandson.       
         Judith Kaplan Eisenstein, an author, musicologist and composer, died yesterday of a heart attack in Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md., where she was being treated for a broken hip. She was 86 and lived in Silver Spring, Md.         The oldest daughter of Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan, the founder of the Reconstructionist branch of Judaism, Dr. Eisenstein was the first woman to have  a bat mitzvah, in 1922.         No thunder sounded," she said in 1992, recalling the ceremony. "No lightning struck."         But opening to women the bar mitzvah rite that had long marked the passage of Jewish males into religious adulthood proved to be the first of many changes broadening the role of women in Judaism, including in recent years their ordination as rabbis.         Today the bat mitzvah ceremony, usually carried out when girls are 12, is an  established practice within the Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist branches of Judaism, and parallel celebrations are common in some quarters of Orthodox Judaism as well.         From 1929 to 1954, Dr. Eisenstein taught music education and the history of Jewish music at Jewish Theological Seminary's Teacher's Institute, now known as  the Albert A. List College of Jewish Studies in Manhattan.         While there she published a Jewish songbook for children, "Gateway to Jewish  Song," which was followed by other books of Jewish music and musical history for young people.  From 1942 to 1974, she wrote seven cantatas on Jewish themes, among them the frequently performed, "What Is Torah," which she wrote with her husband, Rabbi Ira Eisenstein.         In 1959, at the age of 50, Dr. Eisenstein, who had earned a master's degree in music education at Columbia University's Teachers College, began work for her Ph.D. at the School of Sacred Music of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of  Religion in New York. After receiving her degree, she taught there from 1966 to  1979, teaching as well at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in Philadelphia.         The smallest branch of Judaism, Reconstructionism views Judaism as what Dr. Eisenstein's father, Rabbi Kaplan, called the "evolving religious civilization of the Jewish people," emphasizing the cultural and moral heritage of the Jewish people but not traditional supernatural and theistic beliefs.         Dr. Eisenstein, who was born on Sept. 10, 1909, studied at the Institute of Musical Art, now the Juilliard School. An early marriage ended in divorce and in 1934 she married Rabbi Eisenstein, the assistant rabbi at the Society for the Advancement of Judaism, the Manhattan synagogue that her father headed.         She collaborated with her husband on five of her cantatas. In February 1952,  on the eve of a Jewish Music Festival in New York, Dr. Eisenstein defended the idea of a distinctive Jewish music. While Jews had borrowed much musically from  the nations and peoples they had lived among, she wrote in The New York Times, the music of Jews "bears the unmistakable stamp of their own peculiar wistfulness, puritanism, or wry humor."         When she was 82, 12 years past the biblical life span of 70, Dr. Eisenstein had a second bat mitzvah, at which she was also honored by feminist and Jewish leaders, including Betty Friedan, Letty Cottin Pogrebin, Ruth W. Messinger, Elizabeth Holtzman, Rabbi Rachel Cowan and Blu Greenberg.         At that time, Dr. Eistenstein expressed disappointment that bat mitzvah ceremonies, like bar mitzvahs, were often overshadowed by lavish parties. "Bat mitzvah began not just as a statement of feminism," she said, "but as a statement of dedication to something larger than oneself."         In addition to her husband, Dr. Eisenstein is survived by two daughters, Miriam Eisenstein of Gaithersburg, Md., and Ann Eisenstein of Manhattan; three sisters, Hadassah Musher and Selma Goldman, both of Manhattan, and Naomi Wenner  of Chevy Chase, Md., and one grandchild.
