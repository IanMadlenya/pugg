         Georgia Macris, an editor of influential energy industry publications for three decades, died on Jan. 13 at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 86.         The cause was lung cancer, her sister, Sophie Hocknell, said.         Ms. Macris graduated from Radcliffe College in 1940. She joined the Red Cross and served in the Pacific during World War II.         She was hired by McGraw-Hill World News in New York in 1947. When McGraw-Hill began publishing Petroleum Week magazine in 1955, she was named an assistant editor and then, a year later, foreign news editor. In 1961, she was named foreign news editor of Platts Oilgram News, a newsletter published by McGraw-Hill.         In 1968, Ms. Macris moved to Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, a newsletter that was then independently published by Wanda Jablonski and is now part of the Energy Intelligence Group. Ms. Macris served as managing editor from 1970 and as editor from 1972, retiring in 1983.         Ms. Macris chronicled the transformation of the international oil industry from the 1950's. She charted how the business evolved from one dominated by major corporations to one controlled by the nationalized companies in the 1970's.         Ms. Macris is survived by her sister, Ms. Hocknell, of Salem, Mass.       
         Joanne Grant, an activist who documented the grassroots efforts behind the civil rights movement through her journalism, filmmaking and commentary, died on Sunday at St. Vincent's Midtown Hospital. She was 74 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was heart failure, her son, Mark Rabinowitz, said.         Ms. Grant wrote ''Black Protest'' (Fawcett, 1968), a documentary analysis of black resistance from 1619 on. One of the first books to trace the origins of the civil rights movement, it remains required reading in many classes on African-American history.         A former assistant to W.E.B. DuBois, Ms. Grant sought to profile the struggle for civil rights through its community leaders. Her award-winning documentary film ''Fundi: The Story of Ella Baker'' (1981), about an unsung matriarch of the civil rights movement, was broadcast nationally on PBS. She later wrote ''Ella Baker: Freedom Bound'' (Wiley, 1998), a biography. In ''Confrontation on Campus'' (New American Library, 1969), she described sit-ins at Columbia University and elsewhere.         ''She was an important voice in the early writing on the civil rights movement,'' said Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, a professor of African-American studies at Harvard. ''Scholars began to realize that you couldn't understand how this became a national phenomenon unless you understood how communities rallied around issues.''         Friends described Ms. Grant as the movement's publicist and said she saw herself as both journalist and advocate. She was a member of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee in the 1960's and in later years organized benefits for social causes and political candidates.         In the 1960's, as a reporter for The National Guardian, she often traveled to rural Southern towns to describe demonstrations and organizations that other publications largely ignored.         ''She exposed and explained the civil rights movement in ways that the daily press either couldn't or wouldn't,'' said Julian Bond, chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.         Joanne Grant Rabinowitz, whose father was white and mother biracial, was born in Utica, N.Y., on March 30, 1930. She graduated from Syracuse University with a degree in history and journalism.         In addition to her son, Mark, of Manhattan, she is survived by her husband, Victor, a lawyer and activist; a daughter, Abby, of Hamburg, N.J.; a stepson, Peter, of Clinton, N.Y.; a stepdaughter, Joni, of Pittsburgh; a half-sister, Mary Jane Hubbard of Norwich, N.Y.; a half-brother, James Hubbard of Orlando, Fla.; and two step-grandchildren.       
         Phyllis W. Meadow, a psychoanalyst who worked to liberalize training and licensing in her field, died on Jan. 19 at St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan. She was 80 and lived in Brookline, Mass., New York City and Dummerston, Vt.         The cause was gallbladder cancer, said her daughter, Dr. Dena Reed, who is also psychoanalyst.         At a time when the largest psychoanalytic professional association in the United States required psychoanalysts to have medical training, Dr. Meadow, whose doctorate was in human relations, actively sought to open the training of psychoanalysts to those without a medical degree. Their mission placed them at odds with many psychoanalysts, who felt that opening the field to lay analysts might lower standards.         In 1988, the American Psychoanalytic Association, in response to a restraint-of-trade suit by psychologists, agreed to open psychoanalytic training to candidates without medical degrees.         Dr. Meadow felt that ''any qualified person with a B.A. should be eligible to pursue training in psychoanalysis,'' said Jane Snyder, dean of graduate studies at the Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalysis, an alternative training program that Dr. Meadow founded in 1973.         Two of her chief missions, Dr. Snyder said, were to create greater diversity among the kinds of patients being treated and to reduce the number of therapeutic sessions from three to five a week to one or two.         Dr. Meadow taught, wrote, edited, practiced therapy, and founded and led organizations, including the Center for Modern Psychoanalytic Studies in Manhattan, along with its branch, the Cyril Z. Meadow Institute of Psychoanalysis, in Dummerston. This was named for her husband, who founded the New York Center with her and who died in 1998.         Watersheds in Dr. Meadow's campaign, Dr. Snyder said, were 1994, when the Boston Graduate School became one of the first institutions in this country to grant a master's degree in psychoanalysis, and 1999, when the Vermont branch was able to offer a doctorate.         Dr. Meadow also lobbied successfully to liberalize laws regulating the training of psychoanalysts, both federally and in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Vermont, California and other states.         Phyllis Whitcomb was born in Boston on April 12, 1924, the oldest of three daughters of George Whitcomb, a printing and publishing salesman, and Marjorie Loring Whitcomb, who became Gen. Omar Bradley's administrative assistant during World War II. She attended Watertown High School and earned a B.A. from the University of Maryland in 1946.         After working as a magazine writer and editor in New York City, she did clinical work at the National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis, founded by Theodore Reik, receiving certification as a psychoanalyst in 1962. She got her doctorate from New York University in 1969.         Among her books are ''The New Psychoanalysis'' (Rowman & Littlefield, 2003) and ''Ethics for Psychoanalysis: In the Interest of the Patient'' (forthcoming from International Universities Press).         Besides her daughter, her survivors include two sisters, Susan Winbourne of Sudbury, Mass., and Jessie Roland of Navarre, Fla., and three grandchildren.       
         Dr. Sonja Buckley, a Yale virologist and investigator who helped in 1970 to identify the Lassa virus, a potentially deadly disease that originated in Africa, died on Feb. 2 in Baltimore. She was 86.         Dr. Buckley died in a nursing home after a series of strokes, said a close friend, Joyce Maclay.         In the Nigerian village of Lassa in 1969, two missionary nurses rapidly became ill and developed symptoms that included high fever and mouth ulcers before they died from what came to be known as Lassa fever. A third nurse in Lassa contracted the virus and was evacuated to Columbia-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, where she later recovered. Dr. Buckley, who was part of Yale's Arbovirus Research Unit at the time, began to study the virus, using samples of the nurse's blood.         Working with Dr. Wilbur Downs and Dr. Jordi Casals-Ariet, Dr. Buckley succeeded in using tissue cultures to isolate and identify the virus. In the process, Dr. Casals-Ariet himself fell ill and was treated with antibodies taken from the surviving nurse's blood. He recovered from the illness and lived until last year, when he died at 92. But a laboratory technician, Juan Roman, also contracted the fever and died in 1969.         Because of the risk of contagion, the research on the virus was transferred from Yale to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. The virus is transmitted by contact with infected rodents and can be passed from person to person through body fluids.         Dr. Curtis L. Patton, professor of epidemiology of microbial diseases at Yale, said that Dr. Buckley had provided strongly persuasive ''in vitro evidence'' of both the virus and the effectiveness of its antibodies, and ''went on in very remarkable work to demonstrate that antibodies taken from survivors were protective of tissue cultures'' and could be used in treatment.         Lassa fever continues to be endemic in Nigeria, Liberia and Sierra Leone. It is treated with a combination of antibodies, the antiviral drug ribavirin and what Dr. Patton called ''good, close nursing care.''         Dr. Buckley was born Sonja Grob in Zurich and received her medical degree in 1944 from the University of Zurich, where she was later an instructor in microbiology. In 1941, she married Dr. John J. Buckley, a pathologist also studying in Zurich.         After working as a research assistant at Johns Hopkins, she joined the Sloan-Kettering Institute, where she was chosen as head of the solid tumor program in 1949. Sonja Buckley then joined the Rockefeller Foundation in 1957, working in the foundation's virus laboratories. In 1964, the labs were transferred to Yale and became known as the Arbovirus Research Unit.         Dr. Buckley retired from Yale in 1994. She lived in Stamford, Conn., before moving to Baltimore about five years ago.         She is survived by a sister, Annemarie Kohler of Zurich.       
         Elsa H. Zion, a city official and former publishing executive who campaigned successfully to regulate the workload of interns and residents in New York State's hospitals after the highly publicized death of her daughter, Libby, in 1984, died on Thursday at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. She was 70 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was complications of breast cancer, said her husband, the journalist Sidney Zion.         For a decade, until shortly before her death, Ms. Zion was the deputy director of the Bureau of Senior Services, Resources and Partnerships at the New York City Department for the Aging. She was previously an assistant to Andrew J. Stein, then the City Council president.         Libby Zion was 18 when she died in New York Hospital on March 5, 1984, having been admitted eight hours earlier with a high fever. In 1987, a grand jury report cited errors that it said could have contributed to her death. These included being given a painkiller that can interact lethally with the antidepressant drug that she had told doctors she was taking and remaining unmonitored by a doctor for four hours, during which time her temperature rose to 108 degrees. The hospital admitted in 1987 that it had failed to provide adequate care for her, and the State Department of Health fined it $13,000.         After her death, the Zions pushed for limitations on the number of hours medical interns and residents could work each week, and in 1989, New York State adopted regulations limiting interns' and residents' hours and increasing their supervision by senior doctors.         In 1995, a jury in a negligence suit brought by the Zions against the hospital and the doctors who treated their daughter found that an intern and two other doctors had contributed to her death. The jury absolved the hospital of wrongdoing.         Elsa Ruth Heister was born in Winthrop, N.Y., on Feb. 24, 1935. She earned a bachelor's degree from Bard College and a master's in library science from the University of Chicago. In the 1970's and early 80's, she was president of Transworld Feature Syndicate.         Besides her husband, a columnist for The Daily News, Ms. Zion is survived by two sisters, Sandra, of San Francisco, and Martha, of Miami; two brothers, Karl, of Portland, Me., and Robert, of Miami; two sons, Adam, of Brooklyn, and Jed, of Manhattan; and two grandchildren.       
         The Rev. Phyllis Taylor Wofford, who in 1959 was the first woman to become a minister on the staff of Riverside Church in Manhattan, died on April 4 in Norristown, Pa. She was 96. A Pennsylvania resident since 1988, she lived in Lansdale.         Her death was announced by a stepson, former United States Senator Harris Wofford.         Ordained at 50 after a career as a personnel executive in private business, Mrs. Wofford became a full-time minister at the church, doing pastoral work and acting as a liaison officer with other church organizations.         She left in 1963, when her husband, an assistant dean at Columbia University and a church deacon, accepted a post at Robert College in Istanbul.         Phyllis Taylor was born in Norwood, Mass. She grew up in Manchester, N.H., where her father, Herbert, was superintendent of schools, and graduated from Skidmore College in 1930.         She held various jobs before joining the staff of Riverside Church in 1952 to work on women's issues.         When she found herself perplexed by theological questions, Riverside's founding minister, Harry Emerson Fosdick, encouraged her to enroll at the Union Theological Seminary, where she received her Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1959.         She was ordained as a Congregational minister in what is now the United Church of Christ and then became a minister at Riverside, which is interdenominational but affiliated with the United Church of Christ and the Baptist Church .         Mrs. Wofford was active in the hospice movement in Winston-Salem, N.C., in the 1970's until her move to Pennsylvania. Her husband, Harris L. Wofford Sr., died in 1981.         In addition to her stepson, the former Democratic senator from Pennsylvania and now a resident of Washington, Mrs. Wofford is survived by a stepdaughter, Anne Wofford Towson of Shaker Heights, Ohio; another stepson, John G. Wofford of Cambridge, Mass.; 11 grandchildren; and 8 great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Jeanne Petrek, a cancer researcher known for her investigations into the aftermath of breast cancer surgery, especially its impact on fertility, was killed in an accident in Manhattan on Monday. She was 57 and lived in Bronxville, N.Y.         Dr. Petrek died in surgery, hours after being struck by an ambulette while crossing the street at Second Avenue and 64th Street. At the time, she was on her way to work at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where she directed the surgical program at the Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center.         At the time of her death, she was also an attending surgeon in the Breast Service of Memorial Sloan-Kettering's Department of Surgery, and a professor of surgery at Cornell University School of Medicine.         Dr. Petrek was a leading expert on pregnancy-associated breast cancer and the causes of lymphedema, a swelling in the arm and hand that can develop after removal of lymph nodes under the arm. Lymphedema is one of the most common complications after the procedure.         In her 20 years at Memorial Sloan-Kettering, she treated more than 4,000 women and sought ways to provide them not just a longer life but a better one after recovery. One method she pursued was to limit the removal to only one or two lymph nodes -- the sentinel nodes, as they are known -- to which the cancer was likely to spread first, as determined by biopsy.         ''The hallmark of Jeanne Petrek's career was that she was the ultimate patient advocate,'' said Patrick Borgen, chief of the breast service. He said that while most public spending promoted the search for treatments aimed at prolonging life, Dr. Petrek hoped to improve the quality of life for cancer patients.         Dr. Borgen said Dr. Petrek borrowed a euphemism from the military, ''collateral damage,'' to refer to unwanted aftereffects of cancer therapy. Much of her work focused on the means of countering them with hormonal and other treatments.         A central question for Dr. Petrek, Dr. Borgen said, was: ''How safe was it for a young woman to get pregnant after breast cancer?''         She sought the answer in a 10-year study she was about to complete on the changes in ovarian function resulting from breast cancer treatment, like premature menopause, infertility and the overall effect on the quality of the patient's life. She followed the histories of 800 women 44 and younger who had undergone chemotherapy. About half of them were still menstruating after five years, she told The New York Times last September.         According to Memorial Sloan-Kettering, hers was the first extensive study ever undertaken of the safety of pregnancy for such women. Some preliminary findings will be reported to the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Orlando, Fla., next month, Dr. Borgen said. He said Dr. Petrek's investigation would be completed by Dr. Kimberly Van Zee, a senior researcher who had been part of it from the start.         Jeanne Petrek was born in Youngstown, Ohio. She graduated in 1969 from Case Western Reserve, where she also received her medical degree in 1973. After her internship and residency in surgery at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston, she first came to Memorial Sloan-Kettering on a surgical oncology fellowship in 1978-80.         From 1980 to 1984 she was an assistant professor of surgery at Emory University School of Medicine and was on the staffs of Grady Memorial and Emory University Hospitals. She continued her academic career at Cornell in 1984 when she returned to Memorial Sloan-Kettering as an assistant attending surgeon in the breast service of the medicine department.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Jeffrey M. Duban; a daughter, Jean Petrek-Duban of Brooklyn; a son, Paul Petrek-Duban of Bronxville; her mother, Emily Petrek of Manhattan; three brothers, John Petrek of Bainbridge Island, Wash., Jim Petrek of Danville, Calif., and Jerry Petrek of Denver.       
         Frances Langford, a mellow contralto who ventured into combat zones with Bob Hope's troupe during World War II and the Korean and Vietnam Wars to serenade tens of thousands of servicemen with ballads that reminded them of the girls they left behind, died yesterday at her home in Jensen Beach, Fla. She was 92.         Her death was announced by her lawyer, Evans Crary Jr., The Associated Press reported.         Although she regarded herself as more of a singer than an actress, she appeared in roughly 30 films and was half of the successful radio comedy duo ''The Bickersons,'' in which she and Don Ameche played a mismatched, querulous couple. He was devoted to ignoring her and concentrating on sleeping, the only time in the day, he said, when he felt alive; she was an insomniac who needed him as a refuge because she couldn't get to sleep. The show became so popular that it received a Sunday night spot of its own.         But among radio listeners, moviegoers and later a vast audience of G.I.'s, Miss Langford was known for songs like ''I'm in the Mood for Love,'' ''You Are My Lucky Star'' and ''Hooray for Hollywood.''         Mr. Hope thought of her as one of his three gypsies -- entertainers who were willing, like him, to travel all over the globe to entertain the troops. The other two were Jerry Colonna, a bulgy-eyed comic who liked to sing ''On the Road to Mandalay,'' and Tony Romano, a guitarist who sang, arranged and accompanied other talent.         Mr. Hope recalled her with characteristic snip: ''She knows just how much sex to pour and still be dignified.'' The troops frequently asked Miss Langford to sing ''I'm in the Mood for Love,'' a ballad by Dorothy Fields and Jimmy McHugh, her hit record from an otherwise forgettable 1935 movie, ''Every Night at Eight,'' which was mostly a vehicle for George Raft and Alice Faye.         ''The greatest thing in my life was entertaining the troops,'' Miss Langford told The Palm Beach Post years later. She said she was fascinated as well as frightened by being in or close to combat zones. On one occasion, near Bizerte in North Africa, she saw six planes shot down. On two occasions she was in planes that developed engine trouble; one of them crash-landed in New South Wales, Australia, on a flight from Guadalcanal. The other plane landed safely, but not before Miss Langford volunteered to don a parachute and jump.         Frances Langford was born April 6, 1913, in Lakeland, Fla., the daughter of Vasco Langford, a carpenter, and his wife, Anna, who was an accomplished pianist. She attended music college briefly but dropped out and began to work in vaudeville. Her first big break came after her mother drove her to Miami and convinced Rudy Vallee, then a popular star of stage and screen, to listen to her. He liked what he heard, asked her to sing on his radio show and even helped her get a start in New York. A small part in a Broadway musical led to radio appearances and a string of movie musicals.         In 1941, Miss Langford made her first appearance on Mr. Hope's radio show, and the visits to the troops started shortly thereafter. She also wrote a column for Hearst newspapers, recounting some of her experiences as an entertainer in wartime.         After the war, she was featured on a radio variety show and returned to nightclub work. She was married three times, first to the actor Jon Hall, from whom she was later divorced, and then to Ralph Evinrude, the manufacturer of outboard motors. They settled in Florida and started a marina, restaurant and gift shop near her 400-acre estate at Jensen Beach. She became more interested in sailing and fishing than singing, but on occasion she would sing at the restaurant.         Mr. Evinrude died in 1986. In 1994, she married Harold Stuart, an assistant secretary of the Air Force in the Truman administration, who survives her.       
         Mary T. Washington, a bookkeeper who in the 1920's began methodically surmounting racial barriers in business to become the first African-American woman to be a certified public accountant and the head of one of the largest black-owned accounting firms in the nation, died on July 2 at a nursing home in Chicago. She was 99.         Her death was reported by her daughter, Barbara Shepherd.         Ms. Washington began her career after high school in the 1920's at Binga State Bank, one of the nation's largest black-owned banks.         She worked at the bank as an assistant to the cashier and vice president, Arthur Wilson.         When virtually no white C.P.A.'s would hire blacks, Mr. Wilson provided Ms. Washington with the requisite experience, according to an account written by Theresa A. Hammond, who is the chairman of the accounting department at the Carroll School of Management at Boston College.         In 2002, Dr. Hammond published a book on the history of black C.P.A.'s, ''A White-Collar Profession: African-American Certified Public Accountants Since 1921,'' which included Ms. Washington's career and influence.         Inspired by Mr. Wilson, Ms. Washington earned her bachelor's degree in business from Northwestern University in 1941. While a student, she opened her own accounting firm in her basement, recruiting black businesses as clients.         Her husband, Donald Melvin Wylie, a mechanic for Yellow Cab, would cook late-night dinners for the group of ambitious young black men who worked for her during the tax season.         Her first business partner, Hiram Pittman, once described it as an ''Underground Railroad'' for aspiring black C.P.A.'s, who came from across the country to work there because they needed the experience to earn the accounting credential.         A study by the National Association of Black Accountants found that in 1943 Ms. Washington became the first black woman to become a C.P.A. and the 13th black C.P.A. in the country, Dr. Hammond said.         With Mr. Pittman and Lester McKeever, she founded Washington, Pittman & McKeever in 1968, still one of the largest black C.P.A. firms. She retired from the firm in 1985 at age 79.         Mary Thelma Morrison was born in Vicksburg, Miss., on April 21, 1906, to Daisy and William Morrison, a carpenter, who boasted to friends that his young daughter could read the entire newspaper.         When she was 6, her mother died, and she went to Chicago to live with her maternal grandparents. She attended Wendell Phillips High School, where she excelled in math.         Her first marriage, to Seymour Washington, ended in divorce.         Besides Ms. Shepherd, Ms. Washington is survived by two sons, Donald Wylie Jr. of Chicago and Donald Wylie II of Los Angeles; two other daughters, Melanie Blanks of Chicago and Ardelia Smith of Chicago; and nine grandchildren.       
         Edith I. Spivack, a tireless lawyer who worked for the New York City Law Department from 1934, when few other women were government lawyers, until last year, when she reluctantly stopped showing up four days a week, died on Tuesday at St. Francis Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y. She was 95.         The cause was complications of a fall, a daughter, Amy Bass, said.         The Law Department, New York City's legal advocate, has 650 lawyers, making it the third largest law firm in the city and one of the largest in the country. Having served 10 mayors and 23 corporation counsels, Ms. Spivack was by far the longest-serving civil servant in the department and quite possibly in the city.         A colleague, Jeffrey Friedlander, the first assistant corporation counsel, said that Ms. Spivack's formal expertise was tax law. But, he added, her wide-ranging legal knowledge, administrative ability and extensive institutional memory were ''the support behind the men who had the titles.''         Indeed, if Ms. Spivack had been born a man, Mr. Friedlander said, she would not have worked in obscurity for the many decades that she did.         ''She was, essentially, the power behind the throne,'' he said. ''It was clear she was the brains.''         Her most important legal work came in the 1970's, when she was well into her 60's. She helped negotiate loans to keep the city out of bankruptcy. In the Penn Central Railroad bankruptcy, she helped collect many millions of dollars in real estate taxes. She successfully argued a major tax case, Walz v. Tax Commission, before the Supreme Court.         Short, small-boned, impeccably dressed, with a courtly manner from another era, she had a tart wit.         At a Christmas party last year at which Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg awarded her a public service plaque, the mayor tried to make small talk and asked when she graduated from college. Ms. Spivack replied that she graduated from Barnard College in 1929.         The mayor said his mother had graduated from New York University in the same year. Ms. Spivack looked at the mayor and said, ''Well, I guess she couldn't get into Barnard.''         Ms. Spivack was born on April 19, 1910. She grew up in the Bronx and the Upper West Side, the daughter of a seller of cardboard boxes.         After graduating from Barnard at 19, she went to Columbia Law School. She married a fellow student, Bernard H. Goldstein, who died in 1998. She retained her maiden name as a tribute to her parents.         She is survived by Ms. Bass of Port Washington; another daughter, Rita Christopher Frank of Madison, Conn.; and four grandchildren.         Ms. Spivack was rejected by law firms, in part because of the Great Depression, but also, she maintained, because she was a woman and Jewish. When Fiorello H. La Guardia took office in 1934, political appointees were removed and replaced through civil service examination.         Told that the city had no money to pay her, Ms. Spivack worked in the Law Department as a volunteer and was finally hired at half salary: $1,700 a year.         In January 1980, the city began to force foreign consulates to pay their municipal water bills, but the consul general of Colombia refused.         After many telephone calls, she left a message: ''If a check is not delivered this afternoon to the corporation counsel's office, I'm coming up personally to shut off the water.'' The check arrived.         In the 1980's, Ms. Spivack took advantage of the elimination of mandatory retirement and continued to work until 1995, when she officially retired. After three weeks she returned to the department in an advisory capacity.         ''My mom didn't knit, never cooked, never drove,'' Ms. Bass said. ''She never typed. My mom was a professional woman, a professional lawyer.''         After the Penn Central bankruptcy, her efforts recovered $90 million in back taxes. ''For some reason, Penn Central made out the $90 million check directly to me,'' she recalled later. ''But being an honest woman, I handed it over to the city.''       
         Sue Gunter, a pioneering women's college basketball coach who turned Louisiana State University into a national power in a career spanning four decades, died yesterday at her home in Baton Rouge, La.         Gunter, a member of two basketball halls of fame, was 66.         The cause was respiratory failure, the university announced.         Gunter stopped coaching during the 2003-4 season because of severe emphysema and acute chronic bronchitis. Until then, she had missed only one game as a college coach, for her mother's funeral.         Gunter was a head coach at Middle Tennessee (1962-64), Stephen F. Austin (1964-80) and L.S.U. (1982-2004), reaching the National Collegiate Athletic Association tournament 14 times with L.S.U. From 1980 to 1982, she was the women's athletic director at Stephen F. Austin.         Her career coaching record was 708-308. Only Pat Summitt of Tennessee (852-167) and Judy Conradt of Texas (869-278) have won more games in women's basketball.         Gunter was elected to the Women's Basketball Hall of Fame in 2000, and to the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame in March.         She turned over the L.S.U. team to Pokey Chatman, who had spent the last 17 seasons with her as a player or as an assistant coach. Gunter, an oxygen tank at her side, watched practice and films.         L.S.U., under Chatman, reached the N.C.A.A. tournament's Final Four the last two seasons.         Sue Gunter was born May 22, 1939, in Walnut Grove, Miss.         She received bachelor's and master's degrees from Peabody College of Nashville in the early 1960's while playing Amateur Athletic Union basketball for Nashville Business College. From 1960 to 1962, she played for United States national teams against those from the Soviet Union.         Her early coaching career offered few luxuries. At Stephen F. Austin, she also coached softball, tennis and track.         ''She was an administrator,'' Chatman told LSUsports.net last year. ''She probably taught a class. She drove the bus. She coached the team. I remember she told me when she became head coach at Stephen F. Austin she was making $6,500 a year and she thought she'd hit the lottery.''         Conradt told The New York Times last year: ''Sue is one of a group of coaches who, early on, made a commitment to the sport when there was no tangible reason to do it. We weren't paid very well. We toiled in obscurity. The joy of being able to coach young women was reward enough.''         In 1980, Gunter was the head coach of the United States Olympic women's basketball team, which never made it to the Moscow Games because of a United States boycott to protest the Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan. Gunter, who never married, left no immediate survivors.         ''I've been very fortunate,'' she told the LSU Campus publication last year. ''People will call me on the history of women's college basketball, and I say sometimes that I feel like I am the archives.''         Correction:  August 13, 2005, Saturday  An obituary on Aug. 5 about Sue Gunter, a pioneering women's college basketball coach, misstated her standing on the lifetime victory list. It also misstated another coach's record and the given name of a third coach. Three coaches (not two) surpassed her 708 victories: Pat Summitt, whose record is 882-172 (not 852-167); Jody Conradt (not Judy), 869; and C. Vivian Stringer, 723.       
         Mary Ann Malkin, a noted rare-book collector and editor who for nearly two decades helped run AB Bookman's Weekly, the well-thumbed bible of the rare- and secondhand-book business that inflamed and then often sated the acquisitive passions of book collectors around the world, died on Aug. 1 at her home in Manhattan. She was 92.         Mrs. Malkin apparently died in her sleep, said Eric Holzenberg, the director of the Grolier Club of New York, the bibliophilic organization, which announced the death.         Mrs. Malkin, who signed her many book reviews in the magazine with just her initials, was known to generations of rare-book dealers and collectors simply as Mam.         With her husband, Solomon, she ran AB, as it was fondly known in the trade, from 1953 to 1972. (The initials stood for Antiquarian Bookman, the journal's original title.) In later years, Mrs. Malkin became an internationally recognized rare-book collector, amassing a library of historical books on dance notation that is considered the finest in the world.         In the decades after World War II, the mail-order secondhand-book trade was a flourishing enterprise, and AB, founded in 1948, was its chief avenue of communication. Eagerly awaited, greedily pored over and tenderly dog-eared, the journal was almost certainly the only bound artifact that any of its 10,000 subscribers -- rare-book dealers, librarians and private collectors -- would have ever considered marking up.         For 19 years, the Malkins ran the magazine from an office in downtown Newark where every horizontal surface, and many not-quite-horizontal ones, boiled over with centuries of books, papers and pamphlets. Sol. Malkin, who with the typographic exactitude of a cataloguer always spelled his nickname with a period, was AB's owner, editor and publisher. Mrs. Malkin was the administrative assistant, copy editor, proofreader, book critic and maker of coffee, which, for Mr. Malkin, had to be several parts cognac.         Thick, digest-sized and printed on very cheap paper, AB offered trade news, gossip and articles about book collecting. But it was for the classified ads that the journal was prized. Through its Books Wanted and Books for Sale departments, AB united far-flung collectors with dealers around the world, any one of whom just might happen to have a long-sought title in stock. (''Wanted: Any books on horse named Cruiser by Rary, Brown or others, ca. 1870?'' a listing in the issue of Jan. 3, 1953, read.)         Some of the ads catered to highbrow tastes. In December 1953, a dealer in Milwaukee offered an early edition of Gertrude Stein's 1925 novel, ''The Making of Americans,'' signed by Alice B. Toklas, for $12.50.         Others spoke of baser needs. ''Wanted: Spicy pulps of the 30's. Pep, Ginger, Paris Nights, Spicy Detective, Tattle Tales, etc.,'' a 1965 ad read.         Still others were simply bewildering, like this one, from March 22, 1965: ''Wanted: Anything on 'raining' of unusual objects -- frogs, toads, fish, beads, etc. -- falling or 'raining' from the sky.''         Mary Ann O'Brian was born on March 13, 1913, in Altoona, Pa. She earned an undergraduate degree from Pennsylvania State University in 1937, married a professor and moved with him to New York. The marriage ended in divorce, and she took a secretarial job with R.R. Bowker, then the parent company of Publishers Weekly, the book-industry trade magazine.         In 1948, Bowker started publishing Antiquarian Bookman, which had begun as a column in Publishers Weekly, as a stand-alone magazine, with Mr. Malkin as editor. The Malkins married around this time. Mr. Malkin bought Antiquarian Bookman in 1953, changing its name in 1967.         Mr. Malkin, who sold AB in 1972, died in 1986. Faced with rising competition from online used-book sellers, the magazine ceased publication in 1999. Today the Web site abbookman.com, owned by Intergalactic Inc., an Arizona used-bookstore chain that bought the rights to the name, offers information for dealers and collectors but does not sell books directly.         Mrs. Malkin leaves no immediate survivors. Her collection of dance books is now housed at Penn State. The university is also the distributor of a book she wrote with several colleagues, ''Dancing by the Book: A Catalogue of Books, 1531-1804, in the Collection of Mary Ann O'Brian Malkin.'' Published privately in 2003, the book can be obtained in very clean copies, with hard covers (no dust jacket) and many handsome illustrations.       
         Nora Kerr, a longtime editor at The New York Times and a former editor of its Sunday Travel section, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 61 and a Manhattan resident.         Ms. Kerr, who retired from the paper this month, died after having been ill with cancer for some years, her husband, Gordy Thompson, said.         Ms. Kerr joined The Times in 1976 as a copy editor; she was later editor of the paper's Westchester Weekly section and an assistant metropolitan editor. She was editor of the Travel section from 1986 to 1989, and was afterward an editor in The Times Magazine and the Arts & Leisure and Culture sections.         Nora Kerr was born on Nov. 19, 1943, in Cairo, where her parents had met during the war; the family later moved to New Jersey. She attended William Paterson College and Rutgers University and from 1967 to 1976 was a reporter and editor at The Bergen Record.         Ms. Kerr's first marriage ended in divorce. In addition to Mr. Thompson, a retired manager of Internet services at The Times, Ms. Kerr is survived by their son, Andrew Kerr-Thompson; her mother, Hermine, of Wayne, N.J.; and a sister, Jacqueline Kerr Harrold, of Benton, Pa.       
         Ruth Levine Sussman, an acting New York State Supreme Court justice who organized and headed the state system's first Integrated Domestic Violence Court, in the Bronx, died on Aug. 26 at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 46.         The cause was breast cancer, according to an announcement by Judith S. Kaye, chief judge of the Court of Appeals, who selected her in 2001 for the special panel, a pilot project for the state court system.         Justice Sussman grew up in Schenectady, N.Y. She graduated from Smith College in 1980 and received her law degree from Georgetown University's School of Law in 1983, then became an assistant prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney's office.         Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani appointed her a Civil Court judge in 1995, after which she was assigned to Family Court and Criminal Court. She was named an acting justice of the State Supreme Court in 1999.         The Integrated Domestic Violence Court was created by Chief Judge Kaye to bring before a single judge all court proceedings involving domestic violence cases. Those include criminal, family and matrimonial issues that, under the prevailing system, were divided among the Criminal Court, Family Court and Supreme Court.         In her final days on the bench, in mid-June, Justice Sussman was conducting hearings under the Sex Offender Registration Act, known as Megan's Law, in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.         As she was being treated for her illness, Justice Sussman, helped by family and friends, raised money toward a Sussman Family Fund for research at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The center said that the effort had contributed more than $500,000 to its breast cancer programs.         Justice Sussman is survived by her husband, David W. Sussman; their daughters, Jane and Rebecca; her parents, Judge Howard A. and Barbara Levine of Schenectady; and two brothers, Neil and James Levine, also of Schenectady.       
         Betty Lee Hunt, a longtime Broadway and nightclub publicist and producer, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 85.         The cause was non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, said her partner, Maria Pucci. Among the many shows Ms. Hunt publicized were the original Broadway productions of ''Sweet Charity'' and ''Grease.''         She was an associate producer of ''Torch Song Trilogy,'' Harvey Fierstein's groundbreaking play, which won the 1983 Tony Award for best drama and Mr. Fierstein a Tony for best actor. She also co-produced the successful 1986 Off Broadway musical ''Beehive.''         Her extensive personal client roster at various times included Lena Horne, George Shearing, Marian McPartland and Bobby Short, with whom she worked for 35 years.         Born Betty Lee Hurewitz in Brooklyn, Ms. Hunt graduated from Erasmus Hall and began her career as an assistant to Dorothy Ross, a New York publicist for nightclubs like Spivy's Roof, Le Martinique and Le Ruban Bleu. In her early 20's she became publicity director for the Music Corporation of America, then worked for several other companies before forming Betty Lee Hunt Associates in 1950, which represented ''House of Flowers'' and ''The Zoo Story,'' the first of four Edward Albee plays she publicized.         The business was renamed Hunt/Pucci Associates three years after Ms. Pucci joined the company. Among the many shows they represented were Beth Henley's ''Crimes of the Heart,'' Marsha Norman's '''Night, Mother,'' Michael Cristofer's ''Shadow Box,'' John Pielmeier's ''Agnes of God,'' ''Liza Minnelli at the Winter Garden'' and Peter Allen's ''Up in One.''         In addition to Ms. Pucci, Ms. Hunt is survived by a sister, Aileen, and a brother, Saul.       
         Hermine Braunsteiner Ryan was a Queens homemaker in 1964 when The New York Times revealed her notorious past as a vicious Nazi death camp guard.         Nearly a decade later, she became the first United States citizen to be extradited for war crimes. She was sent to West Germany, where she was tried, convicted and sentenced to life in prison.         That was in 1981, and little has been written about her since, although a German newspaper took note of her release, for health reasons, in 1996.         It turns out that she died three years later, on April 19, 1999, at the age of 79.         Her death appears to have gone unrecorded by American newspapers and magazines, although it is noted on the Internet encyclopedia Wikipedia and in a footnote in a 2005 memoir, ''Omaha Blues,'' by Joseph Lelyveld, a former executive editor of The Times, who recounts his experience as the young reporter who knocked on the door of the Ryan home more than 40 years ago.         Official word of Mrs. Ryan's death came in recent weeks from the Simon Wiesenthal Center's office in Israel, in response to questions by another Times reporter who was researching an article on the former Maidanek death camp in Poland, where Mrs. Ryan was once assigned.         Efraim Zuroff, director of the Israeli center, said he believed the death had been noted in some German papers. He said he did not know the cause, but in 1996, when the German government pardoned her from her life sentence, she suffered from diabetes and had had a leg amputated.         Dr. Zuroff said Mrs. Ryan's extradition and conviction were among the few successful legal actions against Nazis in the United States before the Justice Department Office of Special Investigations was established in 1979.         At the time she was discovered, Mrs. Ryan was living as the wife of an electrical construction worker in Maspeth, where she was known for her scrupulous housecleaning and friendly manner. When she was fighting deportation in 1972, The Times quoted neighbors saying her gruesome past was impossible for them to believe.         Survivors of the Maidanek concentration and death camp, near Lublin, told of her whipping women to death, seizing children by the hair and throwing them on trucks to take them to the gas chamber, kicking away a stool to hang a young girl, and stomping old women to death with her jackboots, among other cruelties. Her nickname was the Stomping Mare.         In her five-and-a-half-year trial by a West German court, which ended in mid-1981, Mrs. Ryan was convicted of just two murders. The deaths of possible witnesses and fading memories may have weakened the prosecution's case on other counts. Also, rules limited convictions to individual crimes actually witnessed.         Hermine Braunsteiner was born in Vienna on July 16, 1919. Her father was a butcher and not involved in politics. She received a strict Roman Catholic education and first wanted to be a nurse.         She instead worked in a brewery and as a household servant before going to work at the Heinkel Aircraft Works in Berlin, where she adopted the Nazi ideology. She applied to work at the Ravensbrück women's concentration camp in part to get more pay, starting in 1939.         In October 1942, she was transferred to Maidanek and promoted to assistant warden. She became known for whipping women for not sewing on their prison numbers correctly.         In 1944 she was sent back to Ravensbrück to lead a work detail. She had risen to supervising warden when the Soviet Army approached the camp. She fled to Vienna before the Soviet soldiers liberated the camp on July 23, 1944.         In 1946, she was arrested in Austria and handed over to Allied authorities, who shuffled her between internment and prisoner-of-war camps. In 1949 Austrian authorities again arrested her, and this time tried her.         She was convicted of assassination, infanticide and manslaughter at Ravensbrück in 1941 and 1942. Maidanek was barely mentioned.         Mrs. Ryan was sentenced to three years in prison, but was released early, in 1950. The Austrian government promised not to charge her with any additional crimes and granted her amnesty.         She then worked at hotels and restaurants, and met Russell Ryan, described in various sources as an American soldier or an American construction worker in Germany. In 1958, they moved to Nova Scotia, marrying in October of that year.         In April 1959, they moved to Queens, and she became an American citizen in January 1963.         Simon Wiesenthal, the Nazi hunter, who died in September, wrote in ''Justice Not Vengeance'' (1989) that he was approached in January 1964 in the Cafe Royal in Tel Aviv by three survivors of Maidanek. They told him about the cruel guard called Kobyla, the Polish word for mare.         One of his aides went to Vienna and discovered from her friends that she was in Halifax. Mr. Wiesenthal learned from a friend in Toronto that she had moved to Queens and got the address. The Nazi hunter then told the Vienna correspondent of The Times this information.         Mr. Lelyveld, as a young reporter, was assigned to check out the tip, but wrote that he was not given a specific address. He knocked on many doors of Queens residents with the last name Ryan.         On July 14, 1964, Mr. Lelyveld wrote that Mrs. Ryan readily acknowledged that she was Hermine Braunsteiner of Maidanek. She protested that she had already been punished in Austria, and said she was sick in the infirmary for much of the time she was assigned to Maidanek. Her husband told the reporter that he did not know she was a prison guard until Mr. Lelyveld informed him.         ''This is the end of everything for me,'' Mrs. Ryan said.         In 1971, she was stripped of her citizenship because she had concealed her criminal conviction from American immigration authorities. Germany and Poland then applied for her extradition.         She feared going to Poland, but said she was agreeable to going to West Germany. In August 1973, Mrs. Ryan was expelled from the United States. Her trial in Düsseldorf began in November 1975. With the many witnesses and procedural delays, it did not end until mid-1981.         Mr. Lelyveld wrote that in prison, Mrs. Ryan refused to speak to other inmates and liked to sew dolls and soft toys. When she was released, she went to a nursing home in Bochum-Linden where her husband lived.         A German weekly, Süddeutsche Zeitung Magazin, wrote of the couple in 1996, saying he had been seen pushing her through the market in a wheelchair, and asking her if she would like a bouquet of flowers. She did not respond. He looked at his watch and pushed on. Nothing is known of him now.         Correction:  December 10, 2005, Saturday  An article on the obituary page on Dec. 2 about Hermine Braunsteiner Ryan, a Queens homemaker who had once been a Nazi death camp guard, referred incompletely to the coverage of her death, in 1999. Although her death appears to have gone unrecorded at the time in the United States, it was noted in passing by some newspapers -- including The Daily News and Newsday -- in their obituary coverage, in September, of Simon Wiesenthal, the Nazi hunter who tracked her down.
