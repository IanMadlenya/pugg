         With reminiscences and some of her favorite songs, friends of Mary Martin gathered at the Majestic Theater yesterday afternoon to celebrate her life.         Miss Martin, who died of cancer in November at the age of 76, was recalled as a high-spirited artist who personified some of her signature roles; the eternal child in "Peter Pan," the "cockeyed optimist" in "South Pacific," the ebullient and nurturing protector in "The Sound of Music."         "She was the greatest figure we're ever going to have in musical comedy," said Helen Hayes. She quickly amended the announcement to include Ethel Merman. "Mary would rap me over the knuckles in heaven when I got there," she said, if she did not cite Miss Merman.         Miss Hayes remembered a trip with Miss Martin 35 years ago to Paris, where they were to perform in "The Skin of Our Teeth." Miss Martin took along grand clothes, she recalled, and as they walked through the city one day, "suddenly overhead there was a swoosh of birds," one of whom "took perfect aim on Mary."         "I didn't know her too well," she said, and she feared Miss Martin would "have hysterics" at the marring of her outfit. But, Miss Hayes said, there was Miss Martin "looking at me with a sort of half-smile, and she said, 'For some people, they         sing.'         That was the beginning of our friendship." Gold Dust From the Air         Van Johnson told of the time Miss Martin decided to stage a benefit for a hospital where she had been recovering from a 1982 automobile accident. To his horror, he saw her putting on a harness to reprise a number from "Peter Pan." "I said, 'Mary, you're         not!' "         he recounted, "and she said, 'Oh, yes, I am, and I may not come back.' And she zoomed up to the roof and sprinkled gold dust all over our hair."         Recalling the same car accident and another sign of the artist's indomitable temperament, Florence Henderson cited a time when Miss Martin, still a patient, was given a walker, an object she had apparently never encountered. She took it on a promenade down the corridor. Other people smiled, and she smiled back, Ms. Henderson recalled, adding that "she was         carrying         the walker."         She described Miss Martin as "truly the purest soul that I have ever known," adding, "She was so generous; she always let people into her circle of light." As for artistry, Ms. Henderson recalled a tribute that Miss Merman had made, in her fashion. Asked by a reporter what she had thought of Miss Martin's performance at the opening of "South Pacific," Ms. Henderson said, Miss Merman snapped, "Oh, she's all right, if you like talent.' " New Lyrics to a Favorite Song         In one of several videotapes shown, Miss Martin and Miss Merman were seen singing a medley, alternating, performing together and gradually turning the duet into a mock competition.         Carol Channing performed a tribute to Miss Martin that put new words to "My Heart Belongs to Daddy," the song that propelled Miss Martin to Broadway success in 1938 in Cole Porter's "Leave It To Me." "She played a nurse/She played a nun/She played a boy who was a fairy," Ms. Channing sang. "She stopped the show when she had to crow/And our hearts belong to Mary."         Other participants included the performers John Raitt, Carol Lawrence and Kathleen Nolan and the choreographer Jerome Robbins. President Ronald Reagan and his wife, Nancy, sent remarks in a videotape. Miss Martin's son, the actor Larry Hagman, and daughter, Heller Halliday DeMeritt, introduced the program.         The event concluded with a 1983 videotape of Miss Martin singing a song from "Peter Pan." The tape's final image, of the artist with her arms outstretched, remained on the screen as participants in the memorial returned to the stage to applaud it.       
         Charlotte L. Peskin, chairwoman and president of Polyplastex United, a producer of interiors for aircraft cabins, died on Tuesday at Holy Cross Hospital in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. She was 76 years old and lived in Tamarac, Fla.         She died of peritonitis after surgery, her family said.         Mrs. Peskin was the daughter of Louis Schnitzer, founder of the Yiddish Art Theater in New York, and his wife, Henriette, a noted actress on the Yiddish stage. Mrs. Peskin was a child actress before attending Pratt Institute, where she received a degree in art.         A longtime resident of Brooklyn and West Hempstead, L.I., Mrs. Peskin became secretary of Polyplastex, a publicly held family concern, in 1963. She was named chairwoman and president two years ago.         She is survived by her husband, Sidney, also an officer of Polyplastex; two sons, Roger, of Milford, N.J., and Dennis, of Tarpon Springs, Fla., who are also Polyplastex officers, and three granddaughters.       
         Gloria Holden, an actress whose film career spanned three decades, died Friday after a heart attack. She was 73 years old.         The London-born actress played the wife of Paul Muni in the Oscar-winning 1937 film "The Life of Emile Zola."         She appeared with Spencer Tracy, Myrna Loy and Clark Gable in "Test Pilot" in 1938, with Rosalind Russell and Melvyn Douglas in "This Thing Called Love" in 1941 and with Tyrone Power in "The Eddie Duchin Story" in 1956. Her credits also included "The Corsican Brothers," "Miss Annie Rooney" and "Dream Wife."       
         Lillian Day Lederer, a novelist, biographer and playwright, died yesterday at the DeWitt Nursing Home in Manhattan, where she had lived for the last eight years. She was 98 years old.         She died of heart failure, a cousin, Alexandra Lippman, said.         She was a native New Yorker, the daughter of two prominent physicians of the 1890's, Dr. Alexander Abrams and Dr. Amelia Fendler.         In the 1920's, she wrote magazine articles as Lillian Day, adopting the surname of her first husband.  In 1931, she wrote the novel "Kiss and Tell" and the next year she collaborated with her second husband, Lyon Mearson, on the novel "Our Wife." Later she was co-author of the mysteries "Murder in Time" and "Death Comes on Friday" with her third husband, Norbert Lederer.         Her 1938 novel, "The Youngest Profession," was made into a film starring Edward G. Robinson. A play, "Collector's Item," written with Alfred Golden, had a short run on Broadway in 1952.         In 1950 she moved to France, where she lived for nearly 30 years in Neuilly-sur-Seine and in Paris, where Mr. Lederer died.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Natalie Schafer, an actress best known as the stranded millionaire's wife, Lovey, on the long-running television series "Gilligan's Island," died on Wednesday at her home. She was 90 years old.         She died of cancer, a family spokesman, Frank Lieberman, said.         On "Gilligan's Island" Miss Schafer played the wife of Thurston Howell 3d, portrayed by the late Jim Backus. They were among the marooned charter boat passengers.         The comedy show originally ran on CBS from 1964 to 1967 and remains enormously popular in reruns. There were also three television movies that reunited the original cast: "Rescue From Gilligan's Island" in 1978, "The Castaways on Gilligan's Island" in 1979 and "The Harlem Globetrotters on Gilligan's Island" in 1981.         Miss Schafer was born in Red Bank, N.J. She appeared in a number of Broadway productions from the 1920's though the 1950's, including Moss Hart's "Lady in the Dark" (1941), Peter Ustinov's "Romanoff and Juliet" (1957) and Dore Schary's "Highest Tree" (1959).         Her film credits included "Molly and Me," with Gracie Fields; "Wonder Man," with Danny Kaye, and "Dishonored Lady," with Hedy Lamarr.         Miss Schafer also appeared on television in such shows as "I Love Lucy," "Topper," "Route 66," "77 Sunset Strip" and "The Beverly Hillbillies."         Miss Schafer's husband, the actor Louis Calhern, died in 1956.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Bennetta Bullock Washington, an educator and a former director of the Women's Job Corps, died Tuesday at Howard University Hospital in Washington. She was 73 years old and lived in Washington.         Dr. Washington, who was being treated for complications from a stroke, died of cardiac arrest, a spokeswoman for the family said.         Imbued with the desire to educate the poor and culturally deprived, Dr. Washington believed that all children, including poor, black, inner-city youngsters, have potential.         The daughter of a prominent Baptist minister, she was the wife of Walter Washington, the first elected Mayor of the District of Columbia. During his tenure, 1967 to 1979, she was regarded as one of his two top advisers.         She began her teaching career in a special school for disturbed youths called Boys Junior-Senior High. She was named principal of Cardozo High School in 1961, where she initiated an academic and work-study program that became a model for the National Teacher Corps.         In 1964 she started a Job Corps program for women, setting up training centers around the country. In 1973 she became an assistant to the Assistant Secretary of Labor, specializing in the education, vocational training and counseling of men and women in urban and rural ghettos. She retired in 1981.         Dr. Washington wrote three books about the effects of poverty on the learning process, was a trustee for several colleges and was a member of Presidential committees on youth, hunger and employment of the handicapped.         She graduated from Dunbar High School in Washington and from Howard University, where she receieved her bachelor's and master's degrees. In 1939 she earned a doctorate from Catholic University.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Dr. Bennetta Jules-Rosette, an anthropologist, of Leucadia, Calif.; two brothers, Dr. Samuel C. Bullock, of Philadelphia, and Joseph B. Bullock, of Washington; a granddaughter, and a great-granddaughter.       
         Dame Peggy Ashcroft, an actress who was in the forefront of British theater for more than half a century, died yesterday in London. She was 83 years old.         She suffered a stroke on May 23 and was unconscious in the Royal Free Hospital since then, a spokeswoman for the hospital said.         Dame Peggy was in the Old Vic company in the early 1930's, frequently appearing with John Gielgud in the 1930's and 40's. She often performed in the West End of London in the 1950's and with the Royal Court, the Shakespeare Memorial Theater, the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theater. She was made a Dame of the British Empire in 1956 and in 1962 she became the first British actress to have a theater -- the Ashcroft, in her hometown, Croydon -- named after her in her lifetime.         When she was in her mid-70's Dame Peggy won her greatest international acclaim from roles involving two visits to India. She played a saintly, enigmatic Englishwoman in David Lean's film of E. M. Forster's novel "A Passage to India" and then was cast as a doubting former missionary in a television mini-series, "The Jewel in the Crown," based on Paul Scott's "Raj Quartet."         She won a 1984 Academy Award as best supporting actress for the film; the New York Film Critics Circle voted her best actress. The two performances brought her Britain's top film and television awards. She had previously won a string of awards as the finest actress on the British stage, and in April she won a special Laurence Olivier Award, London's major theatrical prize, for lifetime achievement in the theater. A Juliet to Remember         Dame Peggy was praised as a natural actress who projected an inner serenity and moral gravity. She illumined all of Shakespeare's young leading women and was hailed as the finest Juliet of her generation, artfully attuning her performances to Gielgud and Olivier versions of Romeo and Mercutio as the actors alternated in the roles throughout a season.         Detractors called some of her early performances too genteel and cool, too English bourgeois, but over the decades she displayed increasing versatility in plays by Shaw, Sheridan, Chekhov, Wilde and Ibsen. With uncommon ease she worked closely with new generations of theater people and in later years played Shakespearean matrons and roles created by Edward Albee, Marguerite Duras, Harold Pinter and Beckett.         Her talents included portraying the rejected, the lonely and the oppressed with unsentimental sympathy. As Winnie in Beckett's "Happy Days," she was required to spend the first half of the performance buried up to her waist, the second half to her neck. It's "the greatest part ever written," she said, "nearer to Everywoman than any other I can think of, and like climbing Everest to perform."         In approaching hundreds of roles, including 10 leads in a season at the Old Vic, she tirelessly sought psychological truths. "Acting," she said in 1985, "is a mysterious business, so complicated, so tender a subject, there are no rules, and I think one works instinctively."  'Shimmering Radiance'         Defining her art in "Peggy Ashcroft," a 1988 biography, the critic Michael Billington cited her ear for language, her emotional identification with characters and avoidance of vulgarity and affectation.         Sir John Gielgud spoke of the actress's "shimmering radiance and a kind of forthright, trusting quality." The director Peter Hall said she maintained in old age an "extraordinary immediacy and passionate naivete." Harold Pinter said, "This flame of life she possesses informs all she does."         Dame Peggy appeared in only a few movies. Her most memorable early one was a vignette in Alfred Hitchcock's 1935 thriller, "The 39 Steps," as a farmer's wife who bravely aids the hero (Robert Donat).         In making films she missed the theater's long, searching rehearsals. The problem with films, she said, "is that you have to imagine everything in sufficient detail before you begin."         "With the theater," she added, "there is time to try things out. With filming, it is hit or miss."         She said appearing in films was "instant acting" because a film actor might have to begin at the end of a scene or a movie and not be able to build a role. "Also, you're in the hands of a director and an editor who can cut and shape, and you have no idea how," she said. "And, of course, there's no sharing with an audience, no rapport."         Dame Peggy said she had no desire to retire. "Just a rest after the rather full years I had in India," she said in 1985. "Then I'll wait and see what television or film or the theater bring."         She cherished privacy and granted few interviews, once explaining gently, "I'm not interested in myself, very." But she was outspoken in protesting injustices and inhumaneness, at home or abroad. She criticized apartheid in South Africa and protested the sentencing of a Soviet dissident, Vladimir Bukovsky, and political arrests in Czechoslovakia.         Edith Margaret Emily Ashcroft was born on Dec. 22, 1907, in Croydon, a London suburb, to William Worsley Ashcroft, an estate appraiser, and the former Violetta Maud Bernheim. Her father was killed in World War I when she was 10 and her mother died when she was 18, leaving her elder brother, Edward, as her only close relative.         She studied at the Woodford School in Croydon and after discovering "it was very exciting to become someone else," she said, she enrolled at the Central School of Speech and Drama in London. Her varied roles included Desdemona to Paul Robeson's Othello in 1930, stardom as Juliet and Shakespeare's other golden girls, as she called them, and title roles in Shaw's "Caesar and Cleopatra," John Drinkwater's "Mary Stuart" and Arthur Schnitzler's "Fraulein Elsa."         A 1989 biography of Paul Robeson by Martin Bauml Duberman revealed that Dame Peggy and the actor had had an affair during the run of "Othello," and quoted her as saying, "How could one not fall in love in such a situation with such a man?"         Later roles included an alcoholic mother in "Edward, My Son," in both London and New York; an unloved spinster in "The Heiress," leading parts in Brecht's "Good Woman of Setzuan," Ibsen's "Hedda Gabler" and "Rosmersholm" and the 10-hour tour de force as Margaret of Anjou in the Royal Shakespeare Company's "Wars of the Roses."         Dame Peggy was married and divorced three times. She is survived by two children, Nicholas, a director, and Eliza, by her third husband, Jeremy Hutchinson, a lawyer. Her previous husbands were Rupert Hart-Davis, a publisher, and Theodore Komisarjevsky, a director.       
         Jean Arthur, the buoyant actress whose piquant charm and infectious laughter enriched some of the finest comedy dramas of the 1930's and 40's, died yesterday at the Carmel Convalescent Hospital in Carmel, Calif., where she lived for 35 years. She was 90 years old.         Miss Arthur died of a heart ailment, a family spokeswoman said.         Miss Arthur had a bubbly flair for reflecting the absurdities of life, a subtle vulnerability and a voice that wavered unpredictably between the spunky and the amiable.         The classic films she graced included three by Frank Capra -- "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town," "You Can't Take It With You" and "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" -- and also George Stevens's "More the Merrier" and Billy Wilder's "Foreign Affair."  A Marshmallow Heart         Miss Arthur's winsome talent was brightest in roles where her hard-boiled career woman's exterior masked a marshmallow heart, as when she first exploited and then inspired such country bumpkins as Gary Cooper as Mr. Deeds and James Stewart as Mr. Smith in their uphill challenges to greed and corruption.         The actress's honesty made even implausible scenes and films appear credible. A shy perfectionist, she was invariably self-critical of her performances, refused to pose for cheesecake photographs, rarely granted interviews and was often suspended by Columbia Pictures for rejecting roles. "I just couldn't act in a bad picture," she once said.         She began acting on the Broadway stage and returned in 1950 for a widely praised performance in the title role of "Peter Pan," Sir James M. Barrie's 1904 fantasy about the lad who refused to grow up. The production had 321 performances, one of the longest runs for the classic. Interpreting 'Peter Pan'         The hit prompted Miss Arthur to drop her guard and give an interviewer this interpretation of the theme: "Peter represents the youth in all of us: the freshness and originality of childhood before our parents and schoolteachers have pressed us into a mold. Barrie meant that we should not let that 'genius of childhood' escape us, not let our neighbors and the man at the corner grocery store do our thinking for us. If I can get over the message that we should all try to be ourselves, to be free individuals, then I'm sure I'll have accomplished what Barrie wanted."         The actress, who was originally named Gladys Georgianna Greene, was born on Oct. 17, 1900, in Plattsburg, N.Y., and grew up in the Washington Heights section of Manhattan. Her father was a photographer. When pressed by Hollywood to choose a stage name, she selected one honoring two idols: Jeanne d'Arc and King Arthur.         She attended George Washington High School and soon became a successful advertising model, which led to a movie test and contract. She acted in dozens of silent two-reel comedies, melodramas and westerns. Easily making the transition to sound, she played ingenues in a spate of comedies, adventure yarns and melodramas. In three of them, she had to cope wih the insidious Dr. Fu Manchu (played by Warner Oland).  Back to Hollywood         But unhappy with her roles and determined to master her art, Miss Arthur returned to New York in the early 1930's and acted for several years on the summer theater circuit and Broadway in a total of 14 plays. Most were flops, but critics began to laud her maturing talent.         She won a contract with Columbia Pictures, returned to Hollywood and her comic talents blossomed in "The Whole Town's Talking," a 1935 gangster yarn of mistaken identity.         Miss Arthur credited Frank Capra with nurturing her skill in "Mr. Deeds Goes to Town" (1936) and "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" (1939). In the first comedy, playing a reporter, she humiliates a naive well-meaning heir -- played by Mr. Cooper -- and then saves him from his greedy tormentors at a sanity hearing. In "Mr. Smith," as a secretary, she deceives an artless young senator (Mr. Stewart), but later uses her parliamentary expertise to aid his filibuster and defeat his foes.         Other comedy successes included "Easy Living," "You Can't Take It With You," "The Devil and Miss Jones," "The Talk of the Town," "The More the Merrier," in which she, with Joel McCrea and Charles Coburn, wrestled with the housing shortage in World War II Washington, and "A Foreign Affair." She was nominated for an Oscar for her performance in "More the Merrier."         The actress also won plaudits for roles in such films as "Diamond Jim," "The Plainsman," "History Is Made at Night," "Only Angels Have Wings," "Arizona" and later, in 1953, in "Shane," about the disturbing effect of a gunfighter (Alan Ladd) on a frontier family, with Miss Arthur playing a gentle and loyal wife and mother.         At the peak of her career, in the mid- 1940's, she began studying many liberal-arts subjects at colleges. "All my life," she said, "I've wanted to make enough money so I could stop and be a student for a while. The only real reason for living is doing what you want to do, or trying to, anyway." Years later, she taught acting at Vassar College.         Her later stage appearances were frustrated by directorial and cast disputes and illnesses. On television, she played an urbane lawyer in "The Jean Arthur Show" in 1966, but the scripts were more far-fetched than funny.         Her elusiveness led to contrasting stories about her self-doubts and later psychoanalysis with Dr. Erich Fromm. In 1972, she remarked, "I guess I became an actress because I didn't want to be myself."         Miss Arthur was married twice, to Julian Anker, a photographer, in 1928, and to Frank Ross, a producer, from 1932 to 1949. Both marriages ended in divorce.         In later decades, she spent most of her time at her coastal retreat in Carmel, where she once remarked, "I have a very good life" with some good friends, a brood of cats and "the sea on three sides of me."         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Margot Tomes, an artist and illustrator of children's books, died on Tuesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 73 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of pancreatic cancer, a family friend said.         Miss Tomes was an award-winning illustrator of fairy tales, historical stories in verse for children, songbooks and cookbooks. She illustrated works by Alison Lurie, Jean Fritz, Wanda Gag, Ruth Kraus and Charlotte Zolotow, among others.         The American Library Association listed her work among notable books for children, and the American Institute of Graphic Arts included her work in a 1978-79 exhibition entitled "Communicating With Children." In 1977, "Jack and the Wonder Beans," a book she illustrated, was cited by The New York Times as one of the 10 best children's books of the year. A similar citation was given in 1984 for "If There Were Dreams to Sell."         Miss Tomes began illustrating children's books in 1963 with Barbera Wersba's book "The Brave Balloon of Benjamin Buckley." Most recently she had been illustrating fairy tales like "The Sorcerer's Apprentice," "The Six Swans" and "The Fisherman and His Wife."         She is survived by a sister, Jacqueline Allison of Amagansett, L.I.       
         Jiang Qing, the widow of Mao and herself a leader of China during some of its most tumultuous years, has committed suicide, the Government announced tonight. She was 77 years old.         Ms. Jiang was serving a life prison sentence for her role as leader of the Gang of Four. That name was given to the group of radical Communist leaders whose closeness to the all-powerful Mao enabled them to speak in his name and carry out what they said were his policies during the Cultural Revolution from 1966 to 1976.         Ms. Jiang killed herself in the early hours of May 14, the official New China News Agency reported. The three-paragraph dispatch did not say how she had committed suicide or why, and it was impossible to confirm the account. The agency said also Ms. Jiang had been receiving medical treatment outside prison since May 1984. Grew Up in Poverty         Raised in conditions so poor that hunger reportedly left her with lifelong stomach problems, Ms. Jiang grew up to become a beautiful actress, then used her marriage to Mao to reach the apex of power in China and help preside over the brutal persecution and chaos of the Cultural Revolution. She tried to build her own power base and exercised real control over much of Chinese culture, but in the end she owed her authority, and her ability to inspire fear, to her link with Mao. When he died in 1976, she and her allies in the Gang of Four were soon overthrown.         Few people have been so hated in modern Chinese history, and after her fall she became a symbol of the excesses and brutality of the Cultural Revolution. When her trial was televised each night at the end of 1980, most of the nation was delighted and riveted by the spectacle of Ms. Jiang in the dock. She refused to repent, and even taunted the court to chop off her head.         It was grand drama, for Ms. Jiang could be cruel, petty, ruthless and couragious. Above all, her ambition was dizzying.         "Sex is engaging in the first rounds," she once told an interviewer. "What sustains interest in the long run is political power."         The delay in announcing her death almost certainly was linked to the Government's concern about possible protests leading up to the second anniversary today of the army crackdown on the Tiananmen Square democracy movement. While it would be difficult to imagine university students taking to the streets to mourn her, the authorities apparently thought it best not to take any risks. Tiananmen Date Passes Quietly         In fact, the Tiananmen anniversary passed quietly today, and Ms. Jiang's death seems unlikely to have any major impact on the Chinese political scene. While there is some nostalgia for Mao, his widow was linked with just the kind of ideological extremism from which many Chinese are now trying to escape.         Ms. Jiang (her name is pronounced jyahng ching) came to symbolize the fanatical egalitarianism and passion for ideology of the Cultural Revolution years. Paradoxically, China has returned half a step in that direction in the last two years, and the present leadership is almost certainly far closer to her ideologically than to the growing number of young intellectuals who are waiting for a post-Communist period to dawn.         To many young Chinese, there is not much difference between Ms. Jiang and some of the neo-Maoist hard-liners who remain in power. Ms. Jiang was faulted for persecuting intellectuals, for insisting on an inane uniformity in the arts and for joining in the violent suppression of a democracy movement at Tiananmen Square -- an earlier one, in 1976. Those are precisely the complaints that young people have about some of today's leaders.         During the Cultural Revolution, Ms. Jiang oversaw mass rallies in which her enemies were humiliated and physically abused. She also is said to have sought out and killed those who spurned her in earlier years.         One of her grave miscalculations, in retrospect, was to make an enemy of Deng Xiaoping, now China's senior leader, and denounce him as an "international capitalist agent."         Ms. Jiang has been widely criticized for her ambition and for her efforts to exploit her relationship with Mao for personal gain. There is no doubt that the former actress offended other leaders, usually men, with her aggressiveness, and many accused her of using beauty and sex to win power.         Ms. Jiang caught Mao's eye in the caves at Yanan, the Red Army's hideaway in northern China during the civil war against the Nationalists, in 1938, and she scandalized top Communist officials when the couple apparently began living together before Mao got around to divorcing his previous wife, a respected revolutionary. Ms. Jiang was Mao's third wife, not counting a childhood betrothal that was never consummated.         Apparently because of indignation at the divorce of the second wife and a sense of impropriety that Ms. Jiang was just 24 years old while Mao was 45, party officials reportedly insisted that Mao could marry Ms. Jiang only if she never exercised any political power.         Mao kept that bargain for decades, even after the Communist victory of 1949 established him as the leader of the People's Republic of China. In the 1950's, Ms. Jiang held only minor posts in the cultural world, and there are some indications that the marriage was not going well. Ms. Jiang was in Moscow for health treatment, for example, when Mao made a state visit to the Soviet Union. But he did not visit her. Role in Cultural Revolution         In the 1960's, as Mao felt his influence waning and as he worried about the Communist Party becoming ossified and corrupted by years in power, he launched the Cultural Revolution. Ms. Jiang was involved in the planning of the Cultural Revolution and came to play an increasingly important role in that period.         As Deputy Director of the Cultural Revolution Group, Ms. Jiang appeared at rallies beginning in 1966 and praised the Red Guards, young followers of Mao who were dragging the country into chaos. Her status rose, and she became firmly linked to the faction that favored prolonged revolution and class struggle.         She served on the party Politburo, was in charge of literature and the arts and promoted "revolutionary operas" and other works intended to foster a suitable ideological outlook.         Mao died in September 1976, and within a month she and the other members of the Gang of Four -- Wang Hongwen, Zhang Chunqiao and Yao Wenyuan -- were toppled in a virtual coup d'etat. There was widespread rejoicing in the streets. Mr. Wang, Mr. Zhang and Mr. Yao apparently remain in prison, or at least in some form of house arrest. Steadfast in Her Views         For all the accusations that she was a callow opportunist, Ms. Jiang was one of the few top Chinese leaders over the last few decades who stuck to her views even when they were unpopular. Even Prime Minister Zhou Enlai, revered by many Chinese, bent with the political winds, but after she was arrested and faced the possibility of a death sentence, Ms. Jiang did not renounce her fervent Maoism.         "I was Chairman Mao's dog," she said in her defense. "Whomever he told me to bite, I bit."         After a famous show trial that began in November 1980, Ms. Jiang was sentenced to death, with a two-year reprieve. This was commuted to life imprisonment, and the New China News Agency said in its dispatch today that she had been "out of custody and receiving medical treatment since May 1984."         Earlier this year, an official Chinese newspaper suggested in a rare report about Ms. Jiang that she was still adamantly opposed to the present Government policies. The newspaper, the Hainan Daily, wrote that she "twists her lips, snorts and even says some nonsense like 'This is not the Chairman's revolutionary line.' "         While it might seem strange that the Communist Party leadership could continue to hail Mao during the 1980's while excoriating and imprisoning his widow, the two were not close by the time Ms. Jiang achieved power. By the 1970's they lived apart, and a Chinese book published last year asserted that Ms. Jiang had to request permission from the party Central Committee's Work Office to see her husband. Interviews With U.S. Scholar         Some of the best insights into Ms. Jiang came from a remarkable series of interviews she gave in 1972 to an American scholar, Roxane Witke. Ms. Jiang apparently was attempting to bolster her stature with the interviews. Rivals denounced her for making unauthorized statements, and in the end the interviews hurt her badly.         Jiang Qing, named Li Jin at her birth in March 1914, told Ms. Witke that she had had a miserable childhood. Her mother was a concubine and her father a small-town landowner who beat mother and daughter until they fled home.         At age 14 she joined an underground theater troupe in Shandong Province. At age 16, bereft even of underwear, she went off to Beijing with a traveling theatrical group without consulting her mother. She said that she made contact with the Communists in Qingdao, a port city in Shandong, and that she joined the party in 1932.         In Shanghai, the most exciting city in China in those days, Ms. Jiang played bit parts in a variety of plays, and later films, as well as a few larger roles. One of her roles was that of Nora, the rebellious modern woman, in Henrik Ibsen's "Doll's House," which was then very much in fashion in China.         Actors were then scorned in China, but the theater was dominated by leftist politics and increased her political awareness. She also married or lived with at least two men in this period, and in later years she went to great effort to cover up her early romances and failures. She also sought during the Cultural Revolution to punish anyone who had looked down on her during her Shanghai days.         She asserted that she had been kidnapped by Nationalist agents and held for eight months; whether or not that was true, she did flee Shanghai for the Communist base at Yanan, where she met Mao.         After the triumph of the revolution in 1949, she, like other Communist leaders, developed a taste for luxury. Even during the Cultural Revolution, when she was hailing egalitarianism and posing for pictures doing agricultural labor, she enjoyed foreign films, gourmet meals and the use of a private airplane.         There were rumors in recent years that Ms. Jiang was suffering from throat cancer and that she was refusing to be treated, but it was unclear if this was life-threatening.         Her only known child was a daughter, Li Na, fathered by Mao. According to a Chinese account, Li Na visited Ms. Jiang regularly in Qincheng Prison in the early 1980's but refused to write to the authorities to request her release.         At her daughter's refusal, Ms. Jiang is said to have hurled a watermelon to the ground and protested: "Even you do not care for me. You are heartless."       
         Mildred Dunnock, the actress best known for her performances in stage and screen productions of "Death of a Salesman," died Friday evening at Martha's Vineyard Hospital in Oak Bluffs, Mass. She was 90 years old, said her daughter, Linda McGuire.         Her daughter said that Miss Dunnock died of old age. She lived in West Tisbury, Mass.         Miss Dunnock was nominated for Academy Awards for her film performances as Linda Loman, the salesman's wife, in "Death of a Salesman" (1951) and for her performance in Tennessee Williams's "Baby Doll" (1956).         She was small and slight with a thin, mobile mouth, and she excelled at playing the parts of mothers and eccentric ladies of various kinds. Her admirers praised her power to move audiences by making them care for the characters she portrayed.  Broadway's First Linda Loman         Miss Dunnock originated the Linda Loman role on the stage, appearing with Lee J. Cobb as Willy Loman in the 1949 Broadway production of "Death of a Salesman," by Arthur Miller. She later played that part in the film, in regional productions and on television.         Appraising the film, Bosley Crowther wrote in The New York Times that "as the long-suffering wife, Mildred Dunnock is simply superb, as she was on the stage" in her "portrayal of a woman who bears the agony of seeing her sons and husband turn out failures."         In an interview late in her career, Miss Dunnock observed: "I like to play parts that are not like myself. I'm not the least bit exciting. I'm an ordinary person in an ordinary life, but in my imagination there's no stopping me."         Among her other major portrayals were Lavinia in Lillian Hellman's "Another Part of the Forest," Big Mama in Tennessee Williams's "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof," and Miss Ronberry in "The Corn Is Green," a 1940 Emlyn Williams play starring Ethel Barrymore.  Many New Haven Productions         Miss Dunnock performed in numerous stage productions at the Long Wharf theater in New Haven over the decades, including the parts of Mrs. Tyrone in Eugene O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and the mother in Mr. Williams's "Glass Menagerie."         She taught in the late 1960's at the Yale Drama School. Over the years she also taught at Barnard College and at the Brearley School in Manhattan.         Mildred Dunnock was born in Baltimore Jan. 25, 1901, her daughter said. She earned an A.B. degree from Goucher College there and an M.A. from Columbia. She first appeared on Broadway in the early 1930's.         She became, as one New York Times writer, Warren Hoge, put it in 1976, "an institution among first-nighters, the creator of several major characters in American dramatic literature, a performer studied and revered by younger actors and actresses."         She is survived by her husband of almost 60 years, Keith Urmy, who is a retired executive of Chemical Bank in Manhattan; their daughter, Linda McGuire, an actress who teaches at the Educational Center for the Arts in New Haven; a granddaughter, Patricia McGuire, an actress who is a member of the Trinity Repertory Company in Providence, R.I., and two grandsons.

         Carol Laise, an American Ambassador who was the wife of an American Ambassador and the first woman to be an Assistant Secretary of State, died yesterday at her home in Dummerston, Vt. She was 73 years old.         Miss Laise died of cancer, a spokesman for the family said.         She was named Ambassador to Nepal by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1966 and remained in the post until 1973. In January 1974 she married Ambassador at Large Ellsworth Bunker, a 79-year-old widower, in Katmandu, Nepal. She kept her maiden name professionally.         It was the first marriage between two American Ambassadors. Miss Laise was a close friend of Mr. Bunker's first wife, Harriet Allen Bunker, who died in 1964, and it was Miss Laise's first marriage.         For nearly six years after their marriage the couple saw each other only once a month when Ambassador Laise would take a plane provided by President Johnson and fly to Saigon, where Ambassador Bunker was trying to stabilize the situation in South Vietnam. Named Director General         In October 1973 she returned to Washington and was sworn in as Assistant Secretary of State in charge of the Bureau of Public Affairs, the first woman to hold so high a post in the department. Before her appointment as Ambassador to Nepal she had been director of the Office of South Asian Affairs,         In 1974 Miss Laise became director general of the Foreign Service, the highest nonpolitical job in the Foreign Service, a post she held until she retired in 1977.         Caroline Clendening Laise began her Government career in 1940 as an occupational coder for the Civil Service Commission. In 1946 she went to the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, and in 1948 joined the State Department.         From 1956 to 1961 she was an adviser to American delegates to various United Nations agencies and in 1962 was made deputy director of the Office of South Asian Affairs with responsibilty for diplomatic relations with Afghanistan, Ceylon, Nepal, India and Pakistan.         In comparing the economic problems of Nepal with those of India, she said in a 1966 interview with Ann Terry Pincus of The New York Post, "You could explain that Nepal is like Appalachia, and India has the problems of Harlem." An Adviser in New Delhi         When Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey went to India and Pakistan in 1965, Miss Laise went along as his adviser. In the 1962-63 Chinese invasion of India, Ambassador John Kenneth Galbraith sent for Miss Laise for advice and she spent about a year in New Delhi.         She was a winner in 1965 of the annual Federal Women's Award for outstanding contributions by women in government service, and in 1973 she received the Career Service Award of the National Civil Service League.         Miss Laise, a native of Winchester, Va., was a graduate of American University and received an M.A. in political science from George Washington University.         Her husband, Ambassador Bunker, died in 1984.         She is survived by a brother, Frederick Laise of Santa Fe, N.M.; two stepsons, Samuel Bunker of Dummerston, Vt., and John Bunker of Wheatland, Wy.; and a stepdaughter, Ellen Bunker of Tucson, Ariz.       
         Marguerite Feinstein, founder and director of the retiree division of Local 237 of the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, which represents 23,000 municipal workers in New York City, died on Monday at St. Francis Hospital in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. She was 57 years old and lived in Clinton Corners, N.Y.         Mrs. Feinstein, who was known as Maggie, was the wife of Barry Feinstein, president of Local 237. She died of a cerebral hemorrhage, said Frank Mazza, a spokesman for the union.         Under the Local 237 retiree program, which Mrs. Feinstein founded in 1980, more than 5,000 members participate in classes, community projects and political activities as well as the customary social activities, trips and health-care seminars offered by labor unions. The program has become a model for teamster locals across the country and for locals of other unions.         Mrs. Feinstein was born in Milton, N.Y., and held bachelor's and master's degrees from Marist College. Before joining Local 237, she was director of legislation and political education for the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees in New York State.         Mrs. Feinstein's older son by a previous marriage, John Dakin, who lived in Poughkeepsie, died of a heart attack on July 23. In addition to Mr. Feinstein, she is survived by her younger son, Patrick Dakin of Poughkeepsie; a daughter, Colleen Trogisch of Pleasant Valley, N.Y.; and two granddaughters.       
         Ella Haith Weaver, who directed the Speech Therapy Training Program at Brooklyn College for 18 years and was the wife of Robert C. Weaver, a Cabinet member during the Johnson Administration, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 80 years old.         She died of emphysema, her husband said.         Dr. Weaver is believed to have been the first black woman to earn a doctorate in her field, speech correction, audiology and linguistics. She received her Ph.D. in 1949 from Northwestern.         Dr. Weaver graduated from Carnegie Tech in 1932. She taught in speech departments at Roosevelt College in Chicago and Howard University in Washington, as well as Brooklyn College.         In 1966, President Lyndon B Johnson named her husband Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, making him the first black Cabinet member in the nation's history. At first, Dr. Weaver remained at Brooklyn College and the Weavers had a commuter marriage. But, Mr. Weaver said yesterday, it was not satisfactory and she retired in 1967 to join him in Washington.         While there, she served as a consultant to the Women's Job Corps, the National Advisory Research Council of the Institute of Dental Research and the Children's Hearing and Speech Center, an affiliate of Children's Hospital.         Besides her husband, Dr. Weaver is survived by a brother, Hampton D. Haith of Winston-Salem, N.C.       
         Colleen Dewhurst, one of America's foremost actresses whose career on stage, screen and television spanned 40 years and earned her two Tony Awards and three Emmys, died last night at her home in South Salem, N.Y., The Associated Press reported. She was 67 years old.         Ms. Dewhurst was pronounced dead by her personal physician, said Jan Stutts, a spokeswoman for the Westchester County Medical Examiner's Office. The cause of death was not immediately available.         Ms. Dewhurst was closely identified with the works of Eugene O'Neill, and in 1974 won a Tony Award for her portrayal of Josie Hogan in the acclaimed revival of O'Neill's "Moon for the Misbegotten." She was nominated for a Tony in 1973 for her performance as Christine in O'Neill's "Mourning Becomes Electra," in which she was hailed as one of the United States' pre-eminent tragic actresses.         Her most recent New York appearances were on Broadway in 1988 as Mary Tyrone in O'Neill's "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and as Essie Miller in "Ah, Wilderness!," and as O'Neill's wife, Carlotta Monterey O'Neill, in "My Gene," a one-woman play by Barbara Gelb at the New York Shakespeare Festival in 1987. Led Actors' Equity         Ms. Dewhurst also served two terms as president of Actors' Equity Association, the 39,000-member union of professional actors and stage managers, holding office from June 1985 until last May.         An imposing presence both in person and on stage, Ms. Dewhurst was known as a woman never hesitant to use her distinctive, big throaty voice to express an opinion on almost any subject. In the theater, she conveyed a mature sexuality, a folkish earthiness; her feline smile, crinkly eyes and high cheekbones combined to soften her large stature and enable the audience to feel closer to her and to identify with her characters, who were often tragic.         Her friends considered her passionate and caring. "She's like an earth mother," the actress Maureen Stapleton once said, "but in real life she's not to be let out without a keeper. She's a pushover, a pussycat. She's the madonna of the birds with broken wings." Born in Canada         Colleen Dewhurst was born in Montreal on June 3, 1924. Her father was Fred Dewhurst, a hockey and football player who later became sales manager of a lighting concern. Her family left Canada when she was a child, moving first to Boston and later to Milwaukee.         She attended Milwaukee Downer College, a girls' school, and decided to become an actress. She moved to New York, attended the Academy of Dramatic Arts for two years, and studied acting privately with Joseph Anthony and Harold Clurman. But finding stage work was not easy.         She once described the 10 years from 1948 to 1958 as desperate and frustrating. "It was murder -- murder," she said. She worked as a receptionist, an elevator operator and on a telephone switchboard between roles in summer stock from Tennessee to Maine and bit parts in New York.         Ms. Dewhurst actually made her Broadway debut in a very small role as a dancer in Mr. Clurman's 1952 revival of O'Neill's "Desire Under the Elms." But her first big break came in the mid-1950's, when she came to the attention of Joseph Papp, who was just beginning his New York Shakespeare Festival, producing plays on the Lower East Side, shortly before he moved to Central Park. Playing Kate in "The Taming of the Shrew" in 1956, she was seen by Brooks Atkinson, the chief theater critic of The New York Times. Mr. Atkinson praised her acting in print, and the public began to take notice. Start of a Team         Major success began after the 1958 Greenwich Village Circle in the Square production of Edwin Justus Mayer's "Children of Darkness," in which she appeared with another up-and-coming young performer, George C. Scott. The production was staged by Jose Quintero, who would be her director for many O'Neill roles.         Early in 1959, she played Cleopatra to Mr. Scott's Antony in Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleopatra" for Mr. Papp at the Heckscher Theater. The next year, Ms. Dewhurst and Mr. Scott divorced their respective spouses (Ms. Dewhurst had wed the actor James Vickery in 1947) and married. They had two children, divorced, then later remarried and divorced again.         Her first Broadway role with lines came in a brief 1960 production of Albert Camus's "Caligula," but the next year she won her first Tony Award, as best featured actress, for her portrayal of a suddenly widowed young mother in Tad Mosel's "All the Way Home," an adaptation of James Agee's novel "A Death in the Family."         In 1963, she returned to Circle in the Square and to "Desire Under the Elms," but this time instead of being a dancer she was a co-star, with Mr. Scott and Rip Torn, portraying Abbie Putnam in a critically praised production directed by Mr. Quintero. Starring With Jason Robards         Mr. Quintero also staged the 1974 production of "A Moon for the Misbegotten," in which she co-starred with Jason Robards. Writing in The New York Times, Clive Barnes said Ms. Dewhurst "spoke O'Neill as if it were being spoken for the first time -- and not the first time in a theater (you always hope for that) but for the first time in a certain New England farm, on a certain September night in 1923."         Ms. Dewhurst's other Broadway credits include the 1983 revival of George S. Kaufman and Moss Hart's comedy "You Can't Take It With You," in which she co-starred with Mr. Robards; O'Neill's "More Stately Mansions," with Ingrid Bergman in 1967; Edward Albee's adaptation of Carson McCullers's "Ballad of the Sad Cafe," in 1963, and a revival of Mr. Albee's "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?," with Ben Gazzara and directed by Mr. Albee, for which she was nominated for a Tony in 1977.         She also appeared in many productions for Mr. Papp's Shakespeare Festival, including an "Antony and Cleopatra" in Central Park in 1963 without Mr. Scott (Michael Higgins played Antony) and stagings of "Hamlet" and "Macbeth." Her other Off Broadway plays include Athol Fugard's "Hello and Goodbye," in which she co-starred with Martin Sheen in 1969 and won a Drama Desk Award.         Her many films include Woody Allen's "Annie Hall"; "The Cowboys" and "McQ" with John Wayne; "Tribute" with Jack Lemmon; "The Nun's Story"; "A Fine Madness," and "Ice Castles."         She performed in the recent movie "Dying Young" with Julia Roberts and her son Campbell Scott, who also acted with her in the Broadway revivals of "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and "Ah, Wilderness!" Numerous TV Roles         On television she was seen with Candice Bergen on "Murphy Brown" in the last three seasons as Murphy's mother, Avery Brown, winning an Emmy Award in 1989. Her other television credits include productions of "A Moon for the Misbegotten," two Arthur Miller plays, "The Price" and "The Crucible," "No Exit," "The Women's Room," "As Is," "Anne of Green Gables," "Anne of Avonlea" and "Lantern Hill." She also received Emmys for her roles in "Between Two Women" and "And Those She Left Behind."         Last year, as president of Equity, Ms. Dewhurst became embroiled in the union's dispute with the producer Cameron Mackintosh over whether Jonathan Pryce should be allowed to perform the role of a Eurasian pimp that he created in the London production of "Miss Saigon" when the show opened on Broadway.         The union first barred Mr. Pryce and then reversed its decision, and he went on to win the Tony Award this year as best actor in a musical.         In announcing the ban on Mr. Pryce and her support for the union's declaration that it was inappropriate in 1990 for a Caucasian actor to portray a Eurasian, Ms. Dewhurst said, "It's not censorship because it wouldn't have been censoring for us to ask for the stopping of the minstrel show." She was widely criticized for her statement and her stand, but there were also many who supported her and the union. Active in Theatrical Causes         Long active in theatrical causes, Ms. Dewhurst was a member of the board of the Actors' Fund of America, the theatrical charity and social services agency. She was also the chairwoman of the fund's executive committee, which helps theater professionals who have AIDS. She was the chairwoman of the advisory board of the Actors' Work Program, vice chairwoman of the board of Save the Theaters and a member of the boards of the American Council for the Arts and the Theater Development Fund. In 1982, she was active in the unsuccessful fight to save the Morosco and Helen Hayes Theaters on Broadway from being torn down to make way for the Marriott Marquis Hotel.         But it was acting rather than activism that she cared about the most. "When I started acting -- just a kid -- it was, 'I like theater,' " she said some years ago. "Then it was, 'I love theater.' Now it's more than that."         Ms. Dewhurst lived on a farm in South Salem, in upstate New York, with her companion of the last 16 years, the Broadway producer Ken Marsolais. The farm's population also includes eight cats, two dogs, one goat and a parrot. "The farm," Ms. Dewhurst wrote a few years ago, "is my eye in the storm, my sanity, my safety, my knowledge that there is a place that I do exist, that is my home."         In addition to Campbell Scott, she is survived by another son, Alexander R. Scott, a theatrical stage manager and writer, and two grandchildren.

Early in 1959, she played Cleopatra to Mr. Scott's Antony in Shakespeare's "Antony and Cleopatra" for Mr. Papp at the Heckscher Theater. The next year, Ms. Dewhurst and Mr. Scott divorced their respective spouses (Ms. Dewhurst had wed the actor James Vickery in 1947) and married. They had two sons, divorced, then later remarried and divorced again.         Ms. Dewhurst's first major Broadway role came in a brief 1960 production of Albert Camus's "Caligula," but the next year she won her first Tony Award, as best featured actress, for her portrayal of a suddenly widowed young mother in Tad Mosel's "All the Way Home," an adaptation of James Agee's novel "A Death in the Family."         In 1963, she returned to Circle in the Square and to "Desire Under the Elms," but this time instead of being a dancer she was a co-star, with Mr. Scott and Rip Torn, portraying Abbie Putnam in a critically praised production directed by Mr. Quintero.         Mr. Quintero also staged the 1974 production of "A Moon for the Misbegotten," in which she co-starred with Jason Robards. Writing in The New York Times, Clive Barnes said Ms. Dewhurst "spoke O'Neill as if it were being spoken for the first time -- and not the first time in a theater (you always hope for that) but for the first time in a certain New England farm, on a certain September night in 1923."         Among her many screen credits was the recent movie "Dying Young," with Julia Roberts and her son Campbell Scott, who also acted with her in the Broadway revivals of "Long Day's Journey Into Night" and "Ah, Wilderness!"         Her television appearances included three seasons playing Candice Bergen's mother on "Murphy Brown," for which she won an Emmy Award in 1989. She also received Emmys for her roles in "Between Two Women" and "And Those She Left Behind."         Last year, as president of Equity, Ms. Dewhurst became embroiled in the union's dispute with the producer Cameron Mackintosh over whether Jonathan Pryce should be allowed to perform the role of a Eurasian pimp that he created in the London production of "Miss Saigon" when the show opened on Broadway.         The union first barred Mr. Pryce and then reversed its decision, and he went on to win the Tony Award this year as best actor in a musical.         In announcing the ban on Mr. Pryce and her support for the union's declaration that it was inappropriate in 1990 for a Caucasian actor to portray a Eurasian, Ms. Dewhurst said, "It's not censorship, because it wouldn't have been censoring for us to ask for the stopping of the minstrel show." She was widely criticized for her statement and her stand, but there were also many who supported her and the union. Active in Theatrical Causes         Long active in theatrical causes, Ms. Dewhurst was a member of the board of the Actors' Fund of America, the theatrical charity and social services agency. She was also the chairwoman of the fund's executive committee, which helps theater professionals who have AIDS. She was the chairwoman of the advisory board of the Actors' Work Program, vice chairwoman of the board of Save the Theaters and a member of the boards of the American Council for the Arts and the Theater Development Fund. In 1982, she was active in the unsuccessful fight to save the Morosco and Helen Hayes Theaters on Broadway from being torn down to make way for the Marriott Marquis Hotel.         But it was acting rather than activism that she cared about most. "When I started acting -- just a kid -- it was, 'I like theater,' " she said some years ago. "Then it was, 'I love theater.' Now it's more than that."         Ms. Dewhurst lived on a farm in South Salem, in upstate New York, with her companion of the last 16 years, the Broadway producer Ken Marsolais. The farm's population also includes eight cats, two dogs, one goat and a parrot. "The farm," Ms. Dewhurst wrote a few years ago, "is my eye in the storm, my sanity, my safety, my knowledge that there is a place that I do exist, that is my home."         In addition to her sons, she is survived by two grandchildren. No public service is planned.

         Julia Jackson Christian Preston, a granddaughter of Thomas Jonathan (Stonewall) Jackson, the legendary Confederate general, died Sept. 15 at the Presbyterian Home in High Point, N.C. She was 104 years old.         Mrs. Preston was born in San Diego on June 5, 1887. Her mother, Julia Thomas Neal Christian, died when Mrs. Preston was a child and she was reared by her grandmother, Anna Morrison Jackson, General Jackson's second wife and widow.         She is survived by a son, Thomas Preston, of Silver Spring, Md.; three daughters, Mrs. Anna Shaffner of Fleetwood, N.C.; Mrs. Cortlandt Creech of Winston Salem, and Mrs. Julia McAfee of Jacksonville Beach, Fla.; 15 grandchildren and 22 great-grandchildren.         Correction:  September 27, 1991, Friday         An obituary on Saturday about Julia Jackson Christian Preston, a granddaughter of Stonewall Jackson, misidentified her mother. She was Julia Thomas Jackson Christian.       
         Oona Chaplin, the daughter of one of the great tragic playwrights of the century, Eugene O'Neill, and wife of one of the screen's greatest comic geniuses, Charles Chaplin, died yesterday at the age of 66 in Corsier-sur-Vevey, Switzerland.         She died of cancer of the pancreas, said her lawyer, Herbert Jacoby of New York City.         Mrs. Chaplin, who became known as Lady Oona after her British-born husband was knighted in 1975, was an 18-year-old Brearley graduate and fledgling actress in 1943 when she became the fourth wife of the internationally beloved actor and director, who was then 54 years old. Their elopement so infuriated O'Neill, who was the same age as Chaplin, that he disinherited her.         The Chaplins, who had eight children, lived most of their married life in their 18th-century mansion overlooking Lake Geneva. After her husband's death in 1977, Mrs. Chaplin stayed on, becoming something of a recluse. Renounced Citizenship         Charles Chaplin, who grew up in the slums of London, championed leftist causes during the Cold War and was an ardent critic of the American Government.  In 1952 he went into self-imposed exile with his family. Two years later, it was learned that Mrs. Chaplin had renounced her American citzenship and become an English subject like her husband.         In 1967 Mrs. Chaplin returned to New York without fanfare to visit her mother, who was dying. Chaplin did not return to the United States until 1975, when he was received in triumph and given a special Oscar.         Throughout her life, Oona O'Neill Chaplin was a gracious, quiet presence overshadowed by her ebullient husband. Their home became a kind of intellectual watering hole; Pablo Casals, Nikita Khrushchev, Jawaharlal Nehru and Zhou Enlai were among those who visited the Chaplins in Switzerland.         As a young and somewhat sensitive society beauty, Oona O'Neill had her own following. When she visited the West Coast in her brief attempt to become an actress, she received long daily letters from an admirer named "Jerry" -- the author J. D. Salinger. 'Oriental Objectivity'         Her two best friends from Brearley also went to Hollywood and married famous older men. Carol Grace married the writer William Saroyan, and Gloria Vanderbilt married the conductor Leopold Stokowski. Gloria Vanderbilt once said of her fellow debutante that she possessed "a wonderful quality of oriental objectivity about life."         She met Chaplin through a Hollywood agent who recommended her for a part in a Chaplin movie. Chaplin later said he had considered her too inexperienced at first, but changed his mind when he heard that a studio had offered her a contract.         Mrs. Chaplin's parents had had a bitter divorce when she was 2, and she saw her father only infrequently as she grew up. She managed to survive her difficult childhood relatively unscathed, but her older brother, Shane, and a half-brother, Eugene O'Neill Jr., committed suicide.         Mrs. Chaplin always told friends and interviewers that she was content to remain a wife and mother, and always said she never noticed the difference between her age and her husband's. "He is my world," she said in 1960. "I've never seen or lived anything else."         She is survived by her children: Geraldine, the actress; Michael, Josephine, Victoria, Eugene, Jane, Annette-Emilie and James, and 17 grandchildren.         Correction:  October 1, 1991, Tuesday         An obituary on Saturday about Oona O'Neill Chaplin misstated her age in some copies. Mrs. Chaplin was 66 years old, not 70.       
         Hallie Burnett Zeisel, a novelist, college teacher and co-editor of Story magazine from 1942 to 1971, died on Wednesday at the Steward Health Center in Raleigh, N.C. She was 82 years old.         She died of causes related to a stroke she suffered two years ago, said her daughter, Whitney Voss.         The novelist, who was professionally known as Hallie Burnett, made her reputation as a nurturer of young talent at Story magazine.         She joined the periodical in 1942 as assistant editor and new wife of its editor and founder, Whitney Ewing Burnett. Through the 1940's and 1950's, Story published known and unknown writers alike, paying the same standard fees. Salinger, Cheever, Etc.         During her tenure, Mrs. Burnett helped publish the early short stories of writers like J. D. Salinger, John Cheever and William Saroyan.         Then there was the young soldier named Joseph Heller who entered a writing contest held by the magazine. And there were stories from Carson McCullers and Truman Capote. A Harvard freshman named Norman Mailer won a Story college-writing prize for a piece entitled "The Greatest Thing in the World."         In addition to publishing Story, the Burnetts edited anthologies of stories and fiction, along with "Story Jubilee: Thirty-Three Years of Story" (1965). The Burnetts also operated Story Press, a book-publishing concern. Story magazine closed down in 1971, and Whitney Burnett died two years later.         In 1977, Mrs. Burnett married William Zeisel, who died in 1980. Wrotes Novels and Textbooks         Mrs. Burnett's novels were "A Woman in Possession" (1951), "This Heart, This Hunter" (1953), "The Brain Pickers" (1957) and "The Watch on the Wall" (1965). She also wrote a number of textbooks, including "On Writing a Short Story," which was published in 1983.         Mrs. Burnett, whose family name was Southgate, had little formal schooling in her native St. Louis. She spent a good deal of time at colleges as the daughter and niece of trustees. She was married in the 1930's to Robert Abbott, a college teacher, but the marriage ended in divorce.         Later, she returned to campuses to teach literature and creative writing at schools like Sarah Lawrence, Wagner College, Hunter College and the University of Missouri.         In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, she is survived by a son, John Burnett, of Bali, Indonesia, and six grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth M. Cahill, wife of William T. Cahill, a former Governor of New Jersey, died on Wednesday at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia after a brief illness. She was 79 years old and lived in Haddonfield, N.J.         Mr. Cahill, a Republican who had served in the House of Representatives, was Governor for four years, starting in January 1970.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Cahill is survived by five daughters, Kathleen Tully of Haddonfield, Mary E. Cahill of Washington, Regina Blake Keeley of Potomac, Md., Teresa Cahill of Boston and Eileen Campbell of Merchantville, N.J.; two sons, William T. Jr. and John P., both of Collingswood, N.J.; a brother, George Myrtetus of Scotch Plains, N.J., and 13 grandchildren.       
         Gene Tierney, the elegant actress whose beauty bewitched a tough detective in the 1944 film "Laura" and whose portrayal two years later of a diabolically selfish woman in "Leave Her to Heaven" won her an Academy Award nomination, died Wednesday night at her home in Houston. She was 70 years old.         Miss Tierney died of emphysema, a spokesman for the family said.         Miss Tierney had undergone years of treatment for stress and depression. She retired from films in 1965 after making "The Pleasure Seekers," but made at least two television appearances after that. She told reporters that she preferred her life in Houston as the wife of W. Howard Lee, an oil man whom she married in 1960. He died in 1981. Trying to Cope         A year before her marriage to Mr. Lee, when reporters found her working in a dress shop in Topeka, Kan. (a job she took as part of her psychotherapy at the Menninger Clinic there), she told them she attributed her illness to "my lack of understanding of what I could cope with and what I could not. . . . I tried to work harder and harder, thinking that work would cure everything. All it did was make things worse."         With her blue-green eyes, brown hair, prominent cheekbones and what many young men of the 1940's regarded as the most appealing overbite of the day (Miss Tierney said her movie contract stipulated that her slightly protruding front teeth were never to be fixed) she won plaudits for her patrician look but some criticism for her acting.         Even in "Laura," which more than any other movie established her as a major star, Miss Tierney was faulted by some critics. In that film, a detective (Dana Andrews) falls in love with the portrait of a woman he believes has been murdered. For the first 30 minutes of the film, he and the other characters merely talk about her; then they discover she has not been murdered, and the character appears on screen.         For Thomas P. Pryor, who reviewed the film in The New York Times, Miss Tierney's entrance was a bit of a letdown. She did not "measure up to the word portrait of her character," he wrote.         Nevertheless, Miss Tierney received much praise over the years for the freshness and disarming directness she brought to her portrayal of Laura. The film is still regarded as a classic of its genre.         Among the critics who liked her work was Bosley Crowther, who in 1939 had first seen her perform in the Broadway comedy "Ring Two," by Gladys Hurlburt. She was not yet 20 years old and not long out of finishing school, and she had only a supporting role, but Mr. Crowther wrote in The New York Times that he thought she had talent.         Whatever talent she had she decided not to use on Broadway. She went to Hollywood in 1941, signed a contract with 20th Century-Fox and built her career there. Among her other motion picture credits are "The Return of Frank James" (1940), "Belle Starr" (1941), "The Shanghai Gesture" (1942), "Heaven Can Wait" (1943), "A Bell for Adano" (1945), "Dragonwyck" (1946), "The Razor's Edge" (1946), "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir" (1947) and "The Left Hand of God" (1955).         Gene Tierney was born on Nov. 20, 1920, in Brooklyn, to Howard S. Tierney, a successful Manhattan insurance broker, and the former Belle Taylor. Miss Tierney was educated at Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn.; St. Margaret's School in Waterbury, Conn., and at a finishing school in Lausanne, Switzerland. Even with all the propriety that surrounded her upbringing, her grade-school teachers noted that she liked to mimic them, and at St. Margaret's she was regarded as the "class romantic."  Background Showed Through         For some critics who reviewed her films, Miss Tierney could do nothing to obscure her privileged childhood. As early as 1941, when she made "Belle Starr," The Times said: "As for Miss Tierney, her youth and fancy finishing school background betray her. As Belle, she never shot a man, much less loved one."         But by 1946, when she made "Leave Her to Heaven," the actress in Miss Tierney that had been noticed years before by other critics emerged. David Thomson, in "A Biographical Dictionary of Film," said that in "Leave Her to Heaven," Miss Tierney's portrayal of the selfish and deadly character was "frighteningly credible."         In 1941, Miss Tierney eloped with Oleg Cassini, the well-known couturier and her own wardrobe designer. They had a daughter, Daria, in 1943, who was born retarded, a condition attributed to the German measles Miss Tierney contracted during her pregnancy. They had another daughter, Christina, in 1948.         Miss Tierney's marriage to Mr. Cassini ended in divorce. She is survived by their daughters, Daria, who is institutionalized, and Christina Belmont of Paris; four grandchildren, and a sister, Patricia Byrne of Boynton Beach, Fla.       
         Jeannette E. Kriendler, a philanthropist and the wife of H. Peter Kreindler, the longtime chairman of "21" Club, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 77 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Mrs. Kriendler, who had been suffering from osteoporosis, diabetes and pulmonary disease, collapsed at her Fifth Avenue apartment yesterday morning and died at Mount Sinai a short time later, her husband said.         Mrs. Kriendler was born in New York City and was a graduate of New York University. During World War II she served in a number of executive positions with the Brooklyn chapter of the Motor Transport Service of the American Women's Voluntary Services, the organization that aided the armed forces and local military bases.         She married Mr. Kriendler in 1933, three years after his brother, Jack, founded "21" Club on West 52d Street. Mr. Kriendler was chairman from 1938 to 1989, when he became honorary chairman.         Mrs. Kriendler was a longtime contributor to the New York City Ballet and the New York City Opera and helped raise funds for them. She also contributed to Cornell University Veterinary School in Ithaca, N.Y.         Besides her husband, there are no immediate survivors.       
         Greta Kempton, a painter whose portrait of President Harry S. Truman hangs in the White House, died on Monday at her home in New York City. She was 89 years old.         She died of heart failure, said her daughter, Daisy Dickson of Norfolk, Va.         Miss Kempton, who was born in Vienna, started painting life-size portraits while still a child. She studied art in Vienna and, after her family moved to the United States in the early 1920's, at the National Academy of Design and the Art Students League in New York City. By the mid-1930's, she was living in California and was well-established as a painter of commissioned portraits, with Hollywood studio heads like Louis B. Mayer and Adolf Zukor among her clients.         In the 1940's she painted portraits of several members of the Truman Administration and their families, which led to commissions for portraits of the President, his wife and daughter.         Miss Kempton's husband, A. M. McNamara, a lawyer and business executive, died several years ago.
