         Dominique de Menil, a connoisseur, art collector and creator with her husband, John, of the Menil Foundation in Houston, died yesterday at her home in Houston. She was 89.         Mrs. de Menil and her husband, whose fortune came from oil-well technology, became widely known for commissioning the nondenominational Rothko Chapel near Houston, designed by Philip Johnson and dedicated in 1971. With its somber meditational paintings by Mark Rothko and its adjacent sculpture, ''Broken Obelisk'' by Barnett Newman, it soon became a place of ecumenical pilgrimage.         As collectors, the de Menils cut a very wide swath. Their first serious purchase was a Cezanne watercolor that Mr. de Menil had bought in New York in 1945 on the advice of the Rev. Marie-Alain Couturier, a French Dominican priest and a friend of theirs. Thereafter, everything that was of true quality interested them, from Etruscan art to Cycladic sculptures, Byzantine bronzes, African tribal art, the Surrealist paintings of Max Ernst and the recent work of Cy Twombly, an American painter long resident in Italy.         Public awareness of the size and quality of what they had bought was heightened when the Menil Collection museum opened in Houston in 1987. Mrs. de Menil had commissioned the Italian architect Renzo Piano to build a museum that would ''look small on the outside and be big on the inside.''         Its apparent modesty, allied to a seraphic perfection of detail, made it one of the most beautiful museum buildings in the United States. With no admission charge, no membership and no museum shops, it fostered the contemplation of an astonishingly wide range of objects, from antiquity to the Parisian and American avant-garde of recent times.         The full breadth of the de Menil art collection became evident when a massive selection from it, titled ''Rhyme and Reason,'' was shown at the Grand Palais in Paris in 1984.         Mrs. de Menil's attitude to art was not at all that of an esthete who stood apart from or above mundane concerns. One of the de Menils' earlier ventures in Houston was to take a derelict movie house, the De Luxe Theater, in a neighborhood of mostly black residents and to turn it into a center for exhibitions of works by black artists through the ages. She chose and installed those exhibitions herself. Starting in 1960, the de Menils financed a research project that culminated in a monumental publication called ''The Image of the Black in Western Art.''         From 1973 onward, the Rothko Chapel doubled as a center for colloquiums aimed at fostering mutual understanding on issues affecting justice and freedom throughout the world. The first colloquium drew scholars from Lebanon, Iran, India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Japan, Italy, the United States and Canada.         In 1991 the Rothko Chapel marked its 20th anniversary with a joint award with the Carter-Menil Human Rights Foundation, founded in 1986 with former President Jimmy Carter. Nelson Mandela was the keynote speaker and received the special Rothko Chapel award. The projects were not simply highminded pastimes for Mrs. de Menil. Despite her gentle bearing and soft-spoken ways, those who knew her said she was fervently committed to the causes championed at the Rothko  colloquiums.         For more than 50 years, Mrs. de Menil was a discreet but seemingly ubiquitous force for understanding in many areas of life. The house in Houston in which she and her husband lived and raised their five children was open to people of every age, nationality, color and religion.         Dominique de Menil, the daughter of Conrad Schlumberger and his wife, Louise Delpech, was born in Paris on March 23, 1908. She studied mathematics and physics at the Sorbonne in Paris in 1927-28. Though born in a bastion of French Protestantism, she converted to Catholicism to marry John (then Jean) de Menil in 1931.         In 1941 the de Menils left Nazi-occupied France and made their way to the United States, where Mr. de Menil was to represent the family firm of Schlumberger both in North and South America. Some years after they settled in Houston, they asked Philip Johnson to build them a house for them and their five children.         When it was completed in 1948, people told them that there had never been a flat roof in Houston. ''You'll never be able to sell it,'' they said. Mrs. de Menil said that she didn't mind about the market because she wasn't building to sell. ''Anyway,'' she said later, ''no sooner was our house built than you saw flat roofs everywhere.'' The house was also remarkable for the debut of a celebrated American couturier, Charles James, as an interior designer. It was his belief that only corridors and dark corners should have color, and that the living room should be kept quite plain. As an interior, at that or any other time, it was surprising.         After Mr. de Menil (by then called John, since he had become an American citizen) died in 1973, Mrs. de Menil continued their work. She maintained the Menil Foundation's commitment to two major scholarly enterprises -- the catalogue of the complete works of Magritte, by David Sylvester, and of Max Ernst, by Werner Spies.         Her most recent project was the recovery of a series of Byzantine frescoes on the subject of St. Themnianos from a church in the town of Lysi on the island of Cyprus. Permission was given for her to have them on indefinite loan from Cyprus, provided that they were installed in a chapel consecrated to the Greek Orthodox church. They were installed last February in a chapel designed by her son, Francois.         The French Government conferred on Mrs. de Menil the title of Officer of the Order of Arts and Letters in 1984. Two years later, she received the National Medal of Arts from President Ronald Reagan.         In addition to her son Francois, she is survived by another son, Georges; three daughters, Marie-Christophe de Menil, Adelaide de Menil Carpenter and Philippa de Menil Friedrich; 11 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren.         A funeral service is to be held on Saturday at 2 P.M. at St. Anne's Church in Houston.       
         Sister Bernadette Szymczak, who fought hunger and despair with such loving zeal that she turned a tiny Brooklyn food program into a mighty engine of sustenance and hope, died Monday at Long Island College Hospital. She was 76 and, until six months ago, had been getting up at 5 A.M. to stir the soup and poor people's spirits as the hands-on founding director of St. John's Bread and Life Soup Kitchen.         Friends said the cause was stomach cancer.         On paper, the soup kitchen Sister Bernadette founded in 1982 at the old red-brick campus of St. John's University on Lewis Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant would seem impressive enough. The 1,000 or so hot meals it serves each weekday in the old priests' dining hall make it the largest of the 1,000 emergency food kitchens and pantries that distribute about 60 million meals a year to New York City's poor.         And its array of medical, job placement, adult education and other satellite programs have won it a reputation as a model of its kind.         But to those who knew Sister Bernadette and fell under her spell, the numbers hardly measure her impact on the lives of those most food agencies regard as clients and Sister Bernadette knew only as guests.         ''She turned my life around,'' said Bill Baker, a one-time drug addict and petty criminal, recalling yesterday that his road to personal salvation began one freezing January day a few years ago when he stopped by St. John's for a warming cup of coffee and was approached by Sister Bernadette.         Speaking with a distinct Boston accent, she posed the question that would change his life: ''Would you mind helping with the trays?''         Like countless other street toughs before and after him, Mr. Baker, who had just got out of jail, found himself on his feet taking the first steps with a load of trays that would lead him  into Sister Bernadette's world of service before self.         ''The next day I came in a little earlier,'' he said, recalling the beginning of a slow, often-painful process that would, under Sister Bernadette's gentle goading, lead him to become a full-time volunteer, to abandon drugs and, finally, to join the kitchen's small staff.         ''She never gave up on me,'' he said.         A loving tenacity seemed to be the hallmark of a woman whose guests, not always the most stable of sorts, would sometimes become so disruptive she would throw them out, then welcome them back the next day.         To most of the guests, however, she was a warm and cordial woman who knew the regulars by name, inquired after their children and set such an inspiring standard of scurrying service that it is hardly surprising that the kitchen's two-dozen scurrying volunteers are all former guests.         To the volunteers she was also cordial, unless they became too boisterous, in which case they would see the stern side of a woman who brooked no nonsense when it came to helping those in need.         A native of Boston who was orphaned as a child, Bernadette Szymczak (pronounced SIM-zak) lived for a while in a home operated by the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent DePaul, the order she later joined. By the time she got to Brooklyn in 1971, she had spent 25 years working with children in homes in Boston, Buffalo and Philadelphia.         For a few years after she and other members of the order established themselves in Brooklyn, at the request of the Vincentian priests who run St. John's parish, there seemed little need for a soup kitchen.         The once prosperous neighborhood had descended into poverty, but Food Stamps and other Great Society programs had all but eliminated hunger in Bedford-Stuyvesant and elsewhere, so much so that by 1980 only about 50 small soup kitchens were being operated in New York City.         Then came the Reagan Administration cutbacks of 1981, and as the need for food began to soar, Sister Bernadette, who had already established a thrift shop and an adult education program, started the soup kitchen, initially serving 15 or so meals a day.         Over the next decade and a half, as the slender woman in the plain blue habit grew frail in her work, she became a neighborhood heroine. As she walked along some of the city's meanest streets, layabouts would rise from their stoops, the faces of hardened young criminals would soften and she would be besieged with offers of assistance.         For all her charity, Sister Bernadette, whose idea of a hobby was to do a bit of sewing, then give her handiwork away, was not completely above a taste for luxury.         Friends who knew her weakness would take her out for a breakfast of pancakes or bring her a treat from McDonald's.         She leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Rell Sunn, the Hawaiian surfer who skimmed across the waves with such sure and natural grace that she sometimes seemed at one with the sea, died on Jan. 2 at her home in Makaha on the island of Oahu. She was 47.         Ms. Sunn won international fame as a surfing champion and captured the heart of Hawaii during a stirring 14-year battle with breast cancer.         To the international surfing world, Ms. Sunn was the longboard champion who challenged the men on their own surf and helped make the sport safe for women as a founder of the first women's professional tour.         Hawaiians considered her a state treasure who used her fame to celebrate Hawaiian culture.         By the time her cancer was diagnosed in 1983, Ms. Sunn had established the credentials that would qualify her to become one of the first five women inducted into the International Surfing Museum's Walk of Fame in Huntington Beach, Calif.         A native of Makaha, a small town on Oahu's leeward coast, about 25 miles northwest of Honolulu, Ms. Sunn grew up just three blocks from one of the world's most storied surfing beaches, a reef-ringed stretch of water where big waves abound and the surf is almost always up.         Riding a surfboard almost every day from the age of 4, Ms. Sunn entered her first amateur meet at 16, but quickly ran up against a hard fact of surfing life. Although women had surfed alongside men in Hawaii for centuries, since the arrival of Western missionaries in the 19th century their participation had been discouraged. In the 1950's, boys rode the boards, and girls stayed on the beach, tanning their bodies and looking good in bikinis.         With virtually no competition for women, Ms. Sunn entered men's events, almost always making the finals. By 1975, she and other pioneers, like Joyce Hoffman and Linda Benson, had inspired enough women to take up the sport that Ms. Sunn was able to help found the Women's Professional Surfing Association and establish the first professional tour for women.         Riding the waves around the world, she competed in California, Australia, South Africa, France and elsewhere. In 1982, she became the top-ranked woman on the longboard.         Ms. Sunn had a mastectomy, a bone marrow transplant and so much chemotherapy that she lost her luxuriant amber hair five times, but never her good humor. Typically, the only concession she would make to the disease was to wear a bathing cap when surfing.         After an impatient hospital stay she would wheedle permission from her doctors to return home, but only after they had made her promise to go straight to bed and stay there. As soon as she got home, Ms. Sunn would go straight to the beach. Surfing, she said, was the best therapy.         In October she was able to paddle around the island of Molokai with friends, but she weakened rapidly after that.         On New Year's Day, the woman who once described her cancer as ''the biggest wave ever,'' was taken to the beach on a stretcher to satisfy her last wish, to taste the sea on her lips one more time.         She died the next day, and two weeks later thousands of people gathered at Makaha Beach for a memorial service she had planned.         After her ashes were scattered over the water, several hundred surfers made a final ride with Ms. Sunn, whose middle name, Kapolioka'ehukai, means ''heart of the sea.''         Ms. Sunn, who was married three times, is survived by her husband, Dave Parmenter; a daughter, Jan Carreira of Los Angeles; her parents, Elbert and Roen Sunn of Kailua-Kona, Hawaii; a brother Eric of Makaha, and three sisters, Val Fenwick of Kailua-Kona, Anella Dehr of Makawao, Hawaii, and Kula Sunn of Haiku, Hawaii.       
         Margaret Baltzell Kreig, who wrote about health and medicine and raised early alarms over drug abuse by American young people, died on Jan. 12 at her home in Washington. Ms. Kreig, a former resident of Manhattan, was 76.         The cause was complications from lung cancer, her family said.         Ms. Kreig (pronounced craig) researched her topics by traveling with scientific expeditions to such places as South and Central America. To write about Chinese medicine, she traveled to China in the early 1970's and was one of the first Americans to tour medical centers there.         Besides her many magazine articles she wrote two books of nonfiction, ''Green Medicine: The Search for the Plants That Heal'' (Rand McNally, 1964), and ''Black Market Medicine'' (Prentice Hall, 1967). ''Green Medicine'' told of the scientific quest for natural remedies in tropical rain forests as well as in up-to-date laboratories. For ''Black Market Medicine,'' she accompanied Federal undercover agents and wrote of organized crime groups that counterfeited prescription medicines and secretly took them to market.         Ms. Kreig was born in Chicago and was a fashion model as a young woman. She served in the Marine Corps Women's Reserve in World War II. Intermittently, she attended the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, the University of Chicago and Northwestern University.         In the late 1940's and 50's, she  researched the spread of drug abuse among middle-class youths in the United States and worked with the Federal authorities at a drug treatment center in Lexington, Ky. She also reported on early developments in automobile seat belts, contact lenses and other consumer items.         She was a public relations consultant to pharmaceutical and other manufacturing companies, and was a staff writer and editor at Parents' Magazine. Sometimes using the pen name Peggy Craig, she also wrote murder mysteries and television scripts about crime.         Ms. Kreig was divorced from her first husband, Albert A. Kreig, who died in 1988.         She is survived by her husband, William McAfee; three sons, Raymond Kreig of Anchorage, Andrew Kreig of Washington and Lawrence Kreig of Framingham, Mass.; her mother, Gladys Baltzell Jennings of Clinton, Ark.; and a sister, Frances Stover of Wilmington, N.C.       
         Once upon a time there was a little girl named Mary Lou. Her family's name was Hall, and she was born in Greenville, S.C., on the very first day of 1895. That was a very long time ago. A man named Grover Cleveland was President of the United States, and there were only 44 states. They did not have radio or television in those days, but Mary Lou was never bored. She loved to listen to her mother and grandmother tell stories about the old days.         Her grandmother, who had been a slave, had worked in the kitchen of a great big house. She told Mary Lou what it was like to cook a really wonderful meal for the master's family and then not be allowed to eat any of it.         When she was not listening to her mother and grandmother tell stories about the old days, Mary Lou would play with her sister and her friends. Her father was a carpenter, and Mary Lou never forgot what nice things he made for the house, even a swing for the back yard. Come to think of it, Mary Lou didn't forget anything.         Years later, she could recall how her dog, Bruno, would pick up a pail with his mouth and carry it along in his teeth on family errands. She remembered feeding the pigs and the chickens and the other animals the family kept behind the house. And she had such an eye and memory for detail she could tell you the color (usually red) of the dress she was wearing whenever anything interesting happened to her, which was all the time.         Her father was a very nice man, but he gave Mary Lou a whipping one time. What happened was that Mary Lou and her sister felt sorry for two little girls they knew. Their friends were so poor their toes were sticking out of their shoes. And when their friends' stepfather bought new shoes for his own daughters but none for them, Mary Lou and her sister took their own Sunday shoes and gave them to their friends.         When she grew up, she met a man named John Lollis at a party. He had taken someone else to the party, but Mary Lou was the one he married. They had two little girls, Alice and Ruby. Mr. Lollis was a bricklayer, and when he could not find work in South Carolina he got a job in New York City, then sent for Mrs. Lollis and their two little girls.         They settled in Harlem in 1924, and Mrs. Lollis, who never forgot anything, always remembered the sounds of jazz and laughter and how neat and clean the streets and the people were.         When hard times came in the Depression, Mrs. Lollis began making pies in her kitchen and selling them to friends. Then she started taking them around to the barbershops and drugstores and pool halls and anywhere else she might find a few hungry men.         Cab Calloway was one of her best customers, but the one who gave her the name the Pie Lady and made her famous all over Harlem was another fellow. Maybe he was never actually called Slim before he got into Mrs. Lollis's sweet potato pies, but once he did no one ever had a reason not to call him Fats Waller.         Mr. Lollis died in 1949, and Mrs. Lollis never married again. ''John was a good man,'' she said. ''I could never put up with another man, especially the ones around now.''         Over the years, Mrs. Lollis cooked and cleaned for other people and once worked for Western Union, but as she got older she mostly did volunteer work for the Mount Olivet Baptist Church and kept up with her grandchildren and her great-grandchildren, telling them stories about the old days.         The stories might have stayed mostly in the family if Mrs. Lollis had not been waiting for a bus one day in 1989 when she met a woman named Malika Lee Whitney. Ms. Whitney runs a theater group called Pickney Productions, and pretty soon she had Mrs. Lollis telling her stories at schools and libraries and museums and parks and civic club meetings and African street festivals and black history celebrations all over New York and in Washington.         People of all ages said they learned a lot about 20th century history listening to Mrs. Lollis, but it was the children whose eyes would get the widest and who would listen the hardest when Mrs. Lollis stood up and started telling stories about how things were in the old days.         Afterward, they would ask questions and want to know how she managed to live so long. Mrs. Lollis would tell them she never used tobacco, alcohol or drugs.         After she turned 101, Mrs. Lollis slowed down a bit, but it took a while for her to run down. When she died on Feb. 2, the woman who told stories about the old days was 103 years, 1 month and 1 day old.         Mrs. Lollis, whose daughter Ruby Jewett died in December, is survived by her other daughter, Alice E. Wilson of Atlanta, 3 grandchildren, 6 great-grandchildren and 20 great-great-grandchildren.       
         Martha Ellis Gellhorn, who as one of the first female war correspondents covered a dozen major conflicts in a writing career spanning more than six decades, died on Sunday at her home in London. She was 89.         Ms. Gellhorn was a cocky, raspy-voiced maverick who saw herself as a champion of ordinary people trapped in conflicts created by the rich and powerful. That she was  known to many largely because of  her marriage to Ernest Hemingway, from 1940 to 1945, caused her unending irritation, especially when critics tried to find parallels between her lean writing style and that of her more celebrated husband.         ''Why should I be a footnote to somebody else's life?'' she bitterly asked in an interview, pointing out that she had written two novels before meeting Hemingway and continued writing for almost a half-century after leaving him.         As a journalist, Ms. Gellhorn had no use for the notion of objectivity. The chief point of going to cover anything, she felt, was so you could tell what you saw, contradict the lies and let the bad guys have it.         ''You go into a hospital, and it's full of wounded kids,'' she once said. ''So you write what you see and how it is. You don't say there's 37 wounded children in this hospital, but maybe there's 38 wounded children on the other side. You write what you see.''         Though best known for her groundbreaking journalism, Ms. Gellhorn was also an accomplished fiction writer, author of 5 novels, 14 novellas and 2 collections of short stories, many of which were based on people and incidents she encountered during her prodigious travels.         Fresh out of Bryn Mawr College in 1927, she began writing for The New Republic, then became a crime reporter for a local newspaper in Albany. Ms. Gellhorn got to Europe by writing a brochure for the Holland American Line and traveled throughout the continent. Later, she met Harry Hopkins, President Franklin D. Roosevelt's confidant, and talked her way into a job with the New Deal, wandering America and writing about the effects of the Depression on ordinary people.         She went to Spain in 1937 with nothing but a knapsack and $50, covered the conflict for Collier's Weekly and became Hemingway's lover.         ''In Barcelona, it was perfect bombing weather,'' she wrote in a typical dispatch in 1938. ''The cafes along the Ramblas were crowded. There was nothing much to drink; a sweet fizzy poison called orangeade and a horrible liquid supposed to be sherry. There was, of course, nothing to eat. Everyone was out enjoying the cold afternoon sunlight. No bombers had come over for at least two hours.''         She covered the blitz in London. On D-Day, she stowed away on a hospital ship and snuck ashore as a stretcher bearer. She got British pilots to let her ride along on night bombing raids over Germany. When the Allies liberated Dachau, she was there to write about it.         ''Behind the barbed wire and the electric fence,'' she wrote of her visit to Dachau, ''the skeletons sat in the sun and searched themselves for lice. They have no age and no faces; they all look alike and like nothing you will ever see if you are lucky.''         She covered Russia's war against Finland in 1939, trekked across China with Hemingway in 1940, and became increasingly critical of the United States, which she saw as a ''colonial power,'' eventually settling abroad for good. She covered Vietnam, Nicaraguan contras, the Arab-Israeli conflict and, at the age of 81, the United States invasion of Panama. It was only when war came to Bosnia that she gave it a pass.         ''Too old,'' she said. ''You have to be nimble for war.''         Ms. Gellhorn's war correspondence was collected in ''The Face of War'' in 1959. She always focused on ordinary foot soldiers and civilians, ignoring the generals. Her peacetime journalism was collected in ''The View From the Ground'' in 1988.         Among her novels were ''A Stricken Field'' (1940), set among refugees in Prague just before the Nazi invasion of Czechoslovakia, and ''Liana'' (1944), about the marriage of a mulatto woman and a rich white man in the French Caribbean.         Many reviewers felt Ms. Gellhorn was even more successful as a writer of novellas, and she was highly praised for ''The Weather in Africa'' (1988), three novellas set on that continent, and ''The Novellas of Martha Gellhorn'' (1993).         Ms. Gellhorn sometimes took criticism from political conservatives, who painted her as a left-leaning dilettante whose writing was often didactic and sentimental. Others  criticized her vivid journalism as being, stylistically, too much like fiction and her terse fiction as being, stylistically, too much like journalism.         But her longevity and the compelling pull of her life story overrode such criticisms. A heroine to generations of young women correspondents for her fight to get equal treatment and a place on the front lines with male colleagues, she was also a romantic figure for her wartime relationship with one of the century's most famous writers and her subsequent rejection of him.         Ms. Gellhorn's father was a doctor in St. Louis with progressive notions and her mother, whom she adored, was a suffragist and social reformer who sometimes took her daughter  with her to rallies and protests.         Her father pulled her out of a convent school when he discovered the nuns were teaching female anatomy with a textbook that had its pictures covered and transferred the girl to a progressive coeducational school of which her mother was a co-founder.  Later, at Bryn Mawr, Ms. Gellhorn changed her major from English to French, which became useful for her  journalistic work in Europe. In 1934, she was among a group of American students invited to tour Nazi Germany, and she never forgot her first encounter with Fascism. When she returned to the United States and was working for the Federal Emergency Relief Administration, she befriended Eleanor Roosevelt and spent some time, as the First Lady's guest, at the White House. She also wrote a collection of novellas about it, ''The Trouble I've Seen'' (1936).         Her first marriage, in 1933 to Bertrand de Jouvenel, a French pacifist who was the son-in-law of the novelist Colette, ended in divorce.         In 1936, she wandered into a bar in Key West, Fla., and met Hemingway. They drank, became friends and, the next year, when she showed up in Madrid, she picked up again with Hemingway and other war correspondents. She married the author in 1940, becoming his third wife.         They traveled and worked together, living between conflicts at a villa in Cuba. In 1945, Ms. Gellhorn left Hemingway, walking out after an argument at London's Dorchester Hotel. She was the only one of Hemingway's wives to leave him, and he never forgave her. ''His hatred of her was a terrible thing to see,'' one Hemingway biographer noted. She left, she said, because he was jealous and bullying.         Ms. Gellhorn's third marriage, to T. S. Matthews, an editor at Time magazine, also ended in divorce. She said she just found married life too boring.         After World War II, Ms. Gellhorn adopted a son in Italy and raised him, largely on her own, in Mexico and other countries, where she supported herself with a string of articles for women's magazines.         She is survived by her son, George Alexander Gellhorn of London, and a brother, Alfred Gellhorn of New York.         Ms. Gellhorn had decided that she could no longer live in the United States, and moved from Cuba to Italy to Mexico to Kenya until finally settling in Britain, where she spent her  last 15 years shuttling between a small cottage in Wales, an apartment in London and the world's trouble spots. Her South Kensington apartment became a kind of salon for writers and foreign correspondents.         Bill Buford, the fiction editor at The New Yorker who was previously the editor of Granta, an English literary magazine, wrote about Ms. Gellhorn and her work: ''Reading Martha Gellhorn for the first time is a staggering experience. She is not a travel writer or a journalist or a novelist. She is all of these, and one of the most eloquent witnesses of the 20th century.''         She also wrote a highly regarded travel book in 1979, ''Travels With Myself and Another,'' that was an often humorous recounting of some of her more uncomfortable jaunts to remote corners of the globe, some  with Hemingway, whom she referred to only as Unwilling Companion.         Her first love continued to be a crusading brand of nonfiction. ''Journalism is education for me,'' she wrote. ''Writing is payment for the chance to look and learn.''         She wrote on an old, battered typewriter and had to quit in 1992 when a cataract operation left her with diminished eyesight. She could no longer see the keys and felt she was too old to learn how to dictate.         But she never lost her bite. She chain-smoked, drank and ate what she pleased. ''It bores me, all that health stuff,'' she said. She told one woman who came to interview her late in life that she had to stop. ''This conversation is so boring I think I'm going to faint,'' she said.         Ms. Gellhorn had little use for most war reporting after the Vietnam War, saying that the press' role in ending that conflict had taught military leaders a lesson.         ''They realized the power of the press and have been controlling it ever since,'' she said. ''Look at the Gulf War. If you wanted to go out and say to a soldier, 'How is it, kid?,' you had to bring a minder so the kid says nothing.         ''It seems to me that they feed war reporters at these ridiculous briefings in the ballroom of hotels miles from anywhere.'' The public, she said, needs to realize that it is not getting the full story.         Looking back on a life that was colorful enough for any novel or reportage, Ms. Gellhorn once confessed: ''I'm overprivileged. I've had a wonderful life. I didn't deserve it but I've had it.''       
         Karen Avenoso, an education reporter for The Boston Globe who also wrote about her yearlong battle with Ewing's sarcoma, a rare form of cancer, died yesterday at her home in Westfield, N.J. She was 31.         Ms. Avenoso joined The Globe in 1995 after spending three years at The Daily News of New York. She previously wrote freelance articles for several newspapers, including The New York Times, and for Glamour, Elle and New Woman magazines.         In an article published on July 23,  1997, in The Globe, Ms. Avenoso recounted the trauma of the disease.  ''It has been the hardest, and loneliest, experience I can imagine,'' she wrote. ''A friend describes the disease as me being on a raft alone while the people who love me keep trying to pull me toward shore. But somehow, no matter how hard they tug, I never feel tethered. It's more like I could be washed away at any moment, the rapids chugging over me while everyone stands back, gaping.''         A native of Smithtown, N.Y., Ms. Avenoso graduated from Dartmouth College in 1988. A Rhodes Scholar, she earned a master's degree in Victorian literature in 1991 from Oxford University.         She is survived by her husband, Jonathan Adam Smith Sherman of Westfield; her parents, Ellen and Frank Avenoso of Charleston, S.C.; a brother, Kenneth Avenoso of Portland, Ore., and two grandparents, Lillian Stark of Manhattan and Dorothy Shotsky of Rockville Centre, N.Y.       
         Jean Blackwell Hutson, who as curator and then chief of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture helped make it the world's main public repository of materials on people of African descent, died on  Wednesday at Harlem Hospital. She was 83 and lived in Harlem.         From 1948, when the Schomburg Center was known as the Schomburg Collection, until 1980, when she retired as its chief, Mrs. Hutson harnessed her powerful will to assemble an archive of documents, books and works of art that reflected the experience not just of African-Americans, but of peoples throughout the African diaspora.         Under her supervision, the library grew to 75,000 volumes from 15,000 volumes. She assembled an important collection of historical material from Haiti, as well as of African art, and persuaded her childhood friend, Langston Hughes, to donate a portion of his papers to the center. A friend of Romare Bearden, Dorothy West, Richard Wright, W. E. B. DuBois and other figures of the Harlem Renaissance, Mrs. Hutson helped make the Schomburg the cultural center of Harlem.         Even when people, both black and white, during the integrationist movement of the 1940's and early 50's, questioned the need for a separate archive devoted entirely to black experience, Mrs. Hutson championed it. And in the years when the Schomburg's budget was faltering, she fought for financing, and lobbied the State Legislature for money.         ''She had an exacting personality,'' said Howard Dodson, the present chief of the Schomburg. ''She ran a tight ship and had an astute way of getting what she wanted done.  Once her mind was set on doing something, there was no stopping her.''         She was born in 1914 in Sommerfield, Fla., where her father, Paul O. Blackwell, was in business as a  farmer. Her mother, Sarah Myers  Blackwell, was an elementary school teacher. When she was 4, she and her mother moved to Baltimore while her father remained in Florida to run his business, commuting back and forth to Baltimore to visit his family.         Through her baby sitter, who ran a boarding house, she met the poet Langston Hughes. Hughes was then a student at Lincoln University in Oxford, Pa., and went to Baltimore on weekends. Their friendship endured. Throughout his life he referred to her as his ''baby sister,'' and when Mrs. Hutson came to Harlem as a young woman, Hughes made sure she met the leading writers and artists.         At 15, Mrs. Hutson was class valedictorian at her graduation from Douglass High School in Baltimore, then an all-black high school in a segregated system. The school had exacting standards and emphasized the study of black history and literature. One of her teachers was Yolande Du Bois, the daughter of W. E. B. DuBois.         She attended the University of Michigan, then switched to Barnard College. In 1935, she became the second black woman to graduate from Barnard; the first was Zora Neale Hurston.         Mrs. Hutson wanted to be a psychiatrist but took up library science with the goal of financing medical studies. In 1936 she received a master's degree from the Columbia University School of Library Service.         Her first job was in the New York City Public Branch Library system. As a librarian in the Bronx, Mrs. Hutson noticed that there were few Spanish-language books that would appeal to the borough's Spanish population, and she arranged to buy some. In 1939, she married Andy Razaf, a lyricist who wrote songs for Fats Waller. The marriage ended in divorce eight years later.         In 1950 she married John Hutson, a fellow employee at the Countee Cullen branch library. Mr. Hutson died in 1957. They had one daughter, Jean Frances, who died in 1992. Mrs. Hutson left no survivors.         In 1948, Mrs. Hutson was asked to take over the Schomburg, which was based on the private library of Arthur Alphonzo Schomburg, a Puerto Rican of African descent. ''I was drafted for six months to keep the Negroes quiet,'' Mrs. Hutson once said. ''People who grew up in the Depression didn't throw away jobs, so I came.''         With the rise of the black power movement and the success of independence movements in Africa and the Caribbean, interest in the Schomburg grew. In 1962, under her supervision, the library published the Dictionary Catalogue of the Schomburg Collection, which was put on microfilm and made its holdings known to libraries in Europe, Africa and the Americas.         Mrs. Hutson's work in developing the Schomburg caught the attention of President Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, who asked her help in building an Africana collection at the University of Ghana. She lived in Ghana in 1964.         During the 1960's and 70's, the situation at the Schomburg grew perilous, with its collections deteriorating in the Countee Cullen branch library, a sparsely furnished, poorly lighted  space without air-conditioning at 103 West 135th Street. In 1971, Mrs. Hutson helped establish the Schomburg Corporation to raise money for a new building.         She ''learned to go to Albany,'' as she said once in an interview. There were many politicians, Mrs. Hutson said, ''who had never seen a black woman up in front of them at the legislature.'' Eventually she helped obtain a Federal grant for the construction of a new building.         In 1981, the new $3.7 million center finally opened, five stories tall, built of red brick and glass, climate-controlled, with an art gallery. By then, Mrs. Hutson had retired as the Schomburg's chief, and had taken a job in the office of library administration at the Public Library's headquarters on 42d Street.         Today, the Schomburg Collection holds some 150,000 volumes, 3.5 million manuscripts, the largest assemblage of photographs in the world documenting black life, and precious artifacts including a 16th-century manuscript, ''Ad Catholicum,'' by Juan Latino, believed to be the first book written by a black man.       
         Rene  de Epelbaum, a founder of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo human rights group and one of its most dynamic members, died on Saturday at age 77.         Her colleagues said she had suffered a heart attack.         In 1977, during its crackdown on leftists, the military dictatorship that ran Argentina at the time abducted her three adult children, Luis, Lila, and Claudio, and presumably killed them. Mrs. Epelbaum offered her home as a meeting place for mothers who had suffered the same plight.         Soon after, in open defiance of the junta, the group of mothers began holding weekly protests in the main Government square, the Plaza de Mayo. Today, the protests at the Plaza de Mayo are still held every Thursday as the elderly mothers don their trademark white head scarfs with the names of missing children scrawled in ink.         A Government commission found in the mid-1980's that at least 9,000 people had been killed or disappeared during the right-wing military Government's crackdown on political opponents. Human rights advocates contend that the number of victims was closer to 30,000.         Mrs. Epelbaum, who once taught literature, was a fearless, outspoken critic of the military Government. Her writings, speeches, and trips abroad helped earn the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo international acclaim. She also is credited with bringing worldwide attention to the atrocities of Argentina's military regime, which reliquinshed power in 1983.         ''I remember the first time she gave a press conference in Canada and spoke against the dictatorship,'' said Laura Bonaparte, another member of her group. ''They told her to be careful because she could be killed when she returned to Argentina. Epelbaum replied: 'What is important to me is what we do today, not what will happen tommorrow.' ''         Mrs. Epelbaum was greatly troubled by President Carlos Saul Menem's decision in 1989 to pardon senior military officers accused of human rights abuses. The democratically elected Government said the move was essential for national reconciliation.         ''It is a true moral aberration that leaves in liberty those who violated human dignity and those who rose up against the constitutional order,'' Mrs. Epelbaum said.         Alfredo Bravo, an opposition Congressman whose party has proposed a bill to rescind the military amnesty, said of Mrs. Epelbaum, who leaves no immediate survivors, ''It hurts me deeply that as a Congressman, I have not been able to repair her pain, at least in part, with the abolition of these amnesty decrees.''       
         Ruth Forbes Young, who founded the International Peace Academy, an organization that trains negotiators, diplomats and military personnel in peacekeeping and provides meeting grounds for diplomats involved in efforts to prevent hostilities, died on March 5 at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 94.         Mrs. Young's interest in peace started with the dropping of the atomic bomb in 1945. She first joined the World Federalists, a group that worked to influence governments toward peace, but came to believe that an organization that directly involved private citizens would be more effective.         ''When the bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, I realized that something enormous had happened, something that had never happened before and that people should take responsibility about what to do about it, for the world would be a really different place from now on,'' she said in a videotaped history of the academy, which is based in Manhattan. ''U Thant was Secretary General of the United Nations at the time. So I asked for a meeting with him. He responded and met me and sat on a bench with me outside. I told him my ideas that an international peace academy could be really useful, but I did not know the right people to start such a thing and how would you suggest I go about it.''         U Thant recommended that she enlist the aid of Maj. Gen. Indar Jit Rikhye, who had been military adviser to U Thant and Dag Hammarskjold. After helping establish the academy in 1970, General Rikhye became its first president, holding that position for 20 years. Mrs. Young provided the start-up money for the organization and, together with several foundations, continued to contribute to its financing.         The academy consists of a few specialists who prepare training models in conflict avoidance, mediation, negotiation, maintaining cease-fires and armistice agreements, negotiation and peacekeeping. There were also off-the-record meetings that brought together United Nations representatives, government officials and an assortment of specialists.         More recently, the group sponsored informal monthly breakfast meetings, also off the record, for such participants and led by Olara Otunnu, the current president, and Rita Hauser, chairwoman of the board.         ''The academy has helped in the career development of hundreds of diplomats and military commanders,'' General Rikhye said from his home in Charlottesville, Va. ''Its pioneering efforts in training future peacekeepers and trainers have had a global impact.''         Mrs. Young was born into a family of diplomats in Milton, Mass., the daughter of Ralph Emerson Forbes and Elise Cabot and a great-granddaughter of Ralph Waldo Emerson. Her uncle Cameron Forbes was the first Governor-General of the Philippines and often entertained government and military officials, including President William Howard Taft and Gen. John J. Pershing.         In the mid-1920's, she married George Lyman Paine Jr., an architect in New York City. They divorced in the 1930's. Two sons, Michael Paine of Harvard, Mass., and Cameron Paine of Tylersport, Pa., and two grandchildren survive.         In the early 40's she married Dr. Giles Thomas, a psychologist in Manhattan, who died several years later. Her third marriage, to Arthur M. Young, who built the first helicopter to be certified for commercial use, was in 1948.         The couple set up the Institute for the Study of Consciousness in Berkeley in 1972, believing that the world had become too focused on material objects and needed a new spiritual and moral order. Mr. Young died in 1995.       
         Rose Steinberg Stamler, a pioneer in the prevention and treatment of high blood pressure and a professor emeritus of preventive medicine at the Northwestern University Medical School, died on Feb. 28 at Scottsdale Memorial Hospital in Arizona. She was 75 and lived in Chicago.         The cause was heart failure, said her husband, Dr. Jeremiah Stamler, also a professor emeritus at the school.         Beginning in 1958, Professor Stamler, a sociologist by training, and her husband, a cardiovascular specialist, conducted studies to identify risk factors linked to heart disease. The studies have established the basis for others that have found that a change in life style, like quitting smoking and controlling high blood pressure through proper diet and exercise, can improve longevity.         Professor Stamler was also involved in other research projects, including a survey of more than 10,000 people worldwide that reaffirmed sodium as a factor in high blood pressure.         At her death, Professor Stamler was involved in a study to examine how protein, carbohydrates and fats in the diet affect blood pressure, said Alan Dyer, associate chairman of the department of preventive medicine at the medical school.         In addition to her husband, Professor Stamler is survived by a son, Paul J., of St. Louis, and a sister, Gertrude Asher of the Bronx.       
         Galina Ulanova, whose uncanny blend of unabashed emotionalism and lyrical restraint made her one of the greatest dancers of the 20th century, died here today. She was 88.         Revered in Russia from the moment she made her debut in Leningrad's Maryinsky Ballet in 1928, she riveted the Western world in 1956 when she traveled with the Bolshoi Ballet to London's Royal Opera House. There she astonished critics and fans alike with her performances as Juliet and Giselle.         Inspired by Prokofiev's score to ''Romeo and Juliet'' (one of three he wrote for the ballerina) and by the bold choreography of Leonid Lavrovsky, Miss Ulanova's dancing, and that of the Bolshoi, helped make the case after Stalin's death that Russian classical ballet remained the finest in the world.         ''The impact of the Bolshoi has been overwhelming,'' wrote John Martin, The New York Times's dance critic, when the company traveled for the first time to New York in 1959. ''And it will be something of a calamity if we ever allow ourselves to recover.''         Even with the advance publicity about the majesty of Miss Ulanova's role as Juliet, American critics found themselves astounded. ''To see a legend assume the dimensions of reality before us,'' Mr. Martin wrote about her dancing in ''Romeo and Juliet,'' ''and in the process lose nothing of the quality of legend, is a rare and wonderful experience.''         It was, however, an experience that Russian ballet fans were able to enjoy for decades. Galina Sergeyevna Ulanova was born in 1910 in St. Petersburg -- the home of Fokine, Balanchine, Petipa, Nijinsky and so many other legends of Russian dance. She was taught there by her mother -- who also danced professionally -- before entering the famous ballet school there.         She joined the Maryinsky Theater in 1928, the same year she completed her classical dance training, and she would live long enough to see it become the Kirov and then revert, when the Soviet Union dissolved, to its original name.         It was there that she made her name in Mr. Lavrovsky's ''Romeo and Juliet,'' as well as in such classical staples as ''Swan Lake'' and ''Giselle.'' In 1944, Miss Ulanova was transferred -- reportedly after a personal request by Stalin -- to the Bolshoi in Moscow.         She danced with the Bolshoi until 1960, and for most of that time she was the company's and the Soviet Union's chief soloist.         Miss Ulanova performed most of the greatest roles in classical ballet, including the leads in ''Giselle,'' ''Swan Lake,'' ''Cinderella'' and ''Sleeping Beauty.'' Such was her power that when Mr. Martin criticized -- mildly -- her performance in ''Swan Lake'' during the 1959 New York tour, Pravda responded the next day by accusing him and The Times of being ''bent on continuing the cold war.''         Despite her star status -- and the tension that can cause -- Miss Ulanova was highly popular, eventually becoming a teacher to the greatest dancers -- including Yekaterina Maksimova, Nina Timofeyeva and the current Bolshoi director, Vladimir Vasilyev -- who followed her.         ''On many occasions people tried to push us into conflict,'' Maya Plesetskaya, who replaced her in 1960 as the Bolshoi's leading female dancer, wrote two years ago in her memoirs. ''It could never happen.''         Miss Plesetskaya had only praise for the woman whom she remembered seeing for the first time on the day in 1939 that Hitler's Foreign Minister, Joachim Von Ribbentrop, arrived in Moscow to sign the notorious pact between Germany and the Soviet Union. ''She was an angel and she danced like one,'' she wrote.         Few stars are able to handle the demands of dancing into their 40's, but Miss Ulanova -- who was 49 when she struck New York like a thunderbolt -- was one of them. Still, she often vowed that she would retire when she was 50 and she did. Unlike most of her contemporaries, who return frequently into their dotage for special performances, Miss Ulanova then devoted the rest of her life to teaching.         She received nearly every medal  the Soviets bestowed on their most accomplished citizens, including the Order of Lenin and the Stalin Award.  Although she tried to remain politely uninvolved in party politics -- always an impossibility at the time -- she was twice named a Hero of Socialist labor.         President Boris N. Yeltsin, recovering at his dacha from his most recent illness, issued a statement today praising Miss Ulanova as a rare Russia genius.         ''She was the greatest ballerina of the 20th century,'' he said. ''Her life and the art of dance to which she has give her soul has become part of Russian and world culture. Ulanova has always been for us the symbol of conscience, honor and dignity. She was a true artist.''       
         Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney, the widow of John Hay (Jock) Whitney, the first wife of James Roosevelt and the last of the three glamorous Cushing sisters of Boston, died yesterday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y. She was 89.         Mrs. Whitney was one of the most prestigious figures in New York society, although she disliked publicity and rarely attended large social gatherings. When she did appear at an event, it was considered a coup.         In recent years, in failing health, Mrs. Whitney, a prominent philanthropist in medicine and art, spent most of her time at Greentree, one of the most magnificent private residences in the country, situated on 438 acres in Manhasset, on Long Island's Gold Coast. There, surrounded by an important Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art collection, gardens and greenhouses, Mrs. Whitney was looked after by 20 employees.         Mrs. Whitney was the second-born of the three Cushing sisters, who were renowned in the 1930's and 40's for their brilliant marriages into some of the most prominent families in the country. She inherited the bulk of one of the great American fortunes when Jock Whitney -- sportsman, financier, publisher of The New York Herald Tribune, philanthropist, political mover and shaker, and Ambassador to Britain -- died in 1982. In 1990, Forbes magazine estimated her wealth at $700 million.         Practicing the Art Of Marrying Well         From their debutante days, she and her sisters were celebrated by society chroniclers for their beauty and charm. Her older sister, Mary (Minnie) Cushing, was married to Vincent Astor, the wealthy real estate owner, and after a divorce, to James Whitney Fosburgh, an artist. She died in 1978 at 72. Barbara (Babe) Cushing, the youngest, was married to Stanley Mortimer Jr., a grandson of one of the founders of Standard Oil, and after a divorce, to William S. Paley, the legendary founder and chairman of the Columbia Broadcasting System.         Babe Paley, a perennial name on the world's best-dressed list and a glittering figure in society, also died in 1978, at 62, four months before her older sister.         Betsey Maria Cushing was born in Baltimore on May 18, 1908. Her father was Dr. Harvey Cushing, a neurosurgeon who was a professor of surgery at various times at Johns Hopkins, Harvard and Yale Universities. Her mother was Katherine Crowell Cushing, of a socially prominent family in Cleveland.         Dr. Cushing was a stern father, and Mrs. Whitney later recalled that ''perfectionism was drummed into us.'' The social skills that she learned at Miss May's, a private day school in Boston, and at the Westover School in Middlebury, Conn., were burnished by her mother, who made certain that her daughters excelled in the arts of entertaining and running a household as prerequisites for the advantageous marriages she was determined they would have.         David Grafton, the author of the 1992 book ''The Sisters: The Lives and Times of the Fabulous Cushing Sisters'' (Villard Books), wrote that Katherine Cushing once told a gossip columnist that she expected her girls ''to marry into the highest level of European nobility or into America's moneyed aristocracy.''         There were also two brothers, William and Henry, neither of whom survives.         Although marriage into the Roosevelt family did not apparently meet her highest expectations, it merited no objections. Betsey Cushing met James Roosevelt, the eldest son of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt, when she was 22.         They married at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Brookline, Mass., on June 5, 1930, two days before the bridegroom's graduation from Harvard. Five hundred leaders of the social and political worlds of Boston and New York watched the bride, in a floor-length gown of silver lame, exchange vows with the son of the Governor of New York and his wife. Elliott Roosevelt was his brother's best man, and two other brothers, Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. and John A. Roosevelt, were among the ushers. Minnie Cushing was the maid of honor, and Babe Cushing was a bridesmaid.         As a young married woman, Betsey Cushing Roosevelt ''could be imperious,'' the fashion photographer Horst P. Horst later told Mr. Paley's biographer, Sally Bedell Smith. But,  Ms. Smith wrote, ''Fortunately, Betsey redeemed herself with a rollicking sense of humor and an ability to kick up her heels.''         Not Exactly a Favorite Of Eleanor Roosevelt         The young Roosevelts spent their early married life living with the Cushings, while the bridegroom studied law at the Boston University Law School. When Mr. Roosevelt went into the insurance business, the couple bought a house and property in Framingham, Mass. After his father became President of the United States and chose him as an aide, the couple lived in Georgetown.         The young Mrs. Roosevelt was said to be the President's favorite daughter-in-law, but she enjoyed no such preference from Eleanor Roosevelt and was, in turn, not fond of her mother-in-law. ''The two women were simply too strong and too different in personal style and social preferences,'' Mr. Grafton wrote.         Betsey Roosevelt was often the hostess at the White House when Eleanor Roosevelt was absent. She was in the forefront on a summer day in 1939 when the President entertained King George VI and Queen Elizabeth at a picnic in Hyde Park, N.Y., at which the King ate his first hot dog. Later that day, when the President took the King and Queen for a drive along the Hudson River, the President asked Betsey Roosevelt to go along for company in the car.         Always family-conscious, she enhanced Babe Cushing's debutante season by giving a tea dance at the White House as a second coming-out party. She also introduced Minnie Cushing to Vincent Astor, and the two were married in 1940 after Mr. Astor divorced his first wife.         Even as a member of the President's circle, Betsey Roosevelt preferred a private life, and she did her best to shield her two daughters, Sara and Kate, from the public eye.         In November 1938, James Roosevelt left the Government and went to Hollywood to work in the movie business as an aide to Samuel Goldwyn. His wife followed him, but they separated, and early in 1940 it was disclosed that they were to be divorced. Mr. Roosevelt filed for divorce on grounds of desertion, and his wife filed a cross-complaint on grounds of desertion and cruelty.         In March 1940, Mrs. Roosevelt obtained a divorce decree. She was given custody of the children, child support, a settlement and further payments until she remarried.         Mr. Roosevelt went on to become a decorated Marine officer in World War II, a six-term Congressman from California and a delegate to the United Nations during the Johnson Administration. He died in 1991.         Early in 1942, rumors of a romance between Betsey Cushing Roosevelt and Jock Whitney began circulating in New York, Boston and Washington. He had been divorced in 1940 after 10 years of marriage to the former Mary Elizabeth Altemus.         The couple were married in a small, informal ceremony on March 1, 1942, in her widowed mother's East 86th Street apartment. The bride was 33 and the bridegroom 37.         After a honeymoon at Greenwood Plantation in Thomasville, Ga., one of Mr. Whitney's many residences, the newlyweds moved to Washington, where he ran the motion picture division of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, headed by Nelson A. Rockefeller. Mr. Whitney later joined the Air Force, rose to colonel, was a German prisoner for 18 days in 1944 before escaping and got several decorations.         In 1949, Mr. Whitney adopted his wife's two daughters. The Whitneys moved to London in 1957, when President Eisenhower named Mr. Whitney Ambassador to the Court of St. James's. Mrs. Whitney renewed her friendship with the Queen Mother, whom she had met on the 1939 visit to America. Both Ambassador and Mrs. Whitney became close to Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip.         Mrs. Whitney spent a good deal of her time making the Whitney residences comfortable and welcoming. In his book, Mr. Grafton quoted a friend of hers as saying, ''The Jock Whitneys are just about as 'down-to-earth' as any people can be with a quarter of a billion dollars.''         White House Is Nice, But It's No Greentree         The residences that Mrs. Whitney had at her disposal over the years included, in addition to Greentree on Long Island and the plantation in Georgia, a town house and an elegant apartment in Manhattan; a large summer house on Fishers Island near New London, Conn.; a 12-room house in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., which the Whitneys used when they attended horse races there; a golfing cottage in Augusta, Ga., and a spacious house in Surrey, England, not far from the Ascot racecourse.         E. J. Kahn, Mr. Whitney's biographer, reported that years later one of the daughters, Kate, once took her own children on a tour of the White House. Mr. Kahn wrote, ''After inspecting it, they pronounced it nice enough but hardly on a par with Greentree.''         In addition, the Whitneys shared a renowned Kentucky horse farm, which also bore the name Greentree, with Mr. Whitney's sister, Joan Whitney Payson. It was later sold.         Mrs. Whitney established the Greentree Foundation in 1983 to assist local community groups, and she was its president. She was a benefactor of North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, built in the early 1950's on 15 acres donated by Mr. Whitney and Mrs. Payson.         Mrs. Whitney was also involved with the Museum of Modern Art, Yale University and New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. The Modern received eight major paintings, by artists like Utrillo, Picasso and Seurat, from Mr. Whitney's estate, and Yale received six paintings, valued at $5 million at that time. New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center received a $15 million gift.         After her husband's death in 1982, Mrs. Whitney gave $8 million to the Yale Medical School, then the largest gift in the school's history. The National Gallery of Art got nine American and French paintings, which had been placed in a charitable trust during Mr. Whitney's lifetime. The trust also gave $2 million for acquisitions, and Mrs. Whitney chose a Toulouse-Lautrec painting from her husband's collection, ''Marcelle Lender Dancing the Bolero in 'Chilperic,' '' to give the gallery in his memory.         Mrs. Whitney made art history in 1990 by putting up for sale, by Sotheby's, one of Renoir's most famous paintings, the sun-dappled cafe scene ''At the Moulin de la Galette.'' It brought $78.1 million, then a record auction price for Impressionist art and the second-highest price for any artwork sold at auction.         Among Mrs. Whitney's many public activities were memberships on the boards of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the John Hay Whitney Foundation and the Association for Homemakers Service.         She is survived by her daughters, Kate Whitney and Sara Wilford, both of Manhattan; eight grandchildren, and 16 great-grandchildren.       
         Celestine Tate Harrington, a quadriplegic street musician whose buoyant personality and unremitting chutzpah brought astounded smiles to everyone who watched her play the keyboard with her lips and tongue on Atlantic City's Boardwalk, died on Feb. 25 at the Atlantic City Medical Center. She was 42.         She died of complications resulting from critical injuries she suffered in a traffic accident on Feb. 19.         Mrs. Harrington was born with a congenital joint condition that eroded the connective tissue in her arms and legs, leaving them immobile stubs, but she never seemed to consider herself disabled. Her daily street performances in front of Bally's Park Place Casino and Caesar's Palace, where she performed ''Amazing Grace'' and ''Stormy Weather'' on an electric synthesizer, were studies not only in the art of music, but also in the art human self-salvation.         Mrs. Harrington was born in the Germantown section of Philadelphia, and her father abandoned her when she was 6 years old, family members and a friend said.         Raised by her maternal grandparents, a construction worker and a registered nurse, she eventually became a parent herself. In 1974, in downtown Philadelphia, she met John Smith, a nursing home aide who courted her while she lived at the Moss Rehabilitation Clinic in Philadelphia. She bore him a daughter, Nia, in 1975, but before the couple could marry, Mr. Smith died.         The death led the courts to seek custody of Nia. Mrs. Harrington won the right to raise her child in 1976 by demonstrating to a dumbstruck judge what she could manage: she changed the baby's diaper with her teeth.         Three years later, she met a construction worker, Stanford Williams. In 1979, they, too, had a daughter, Coronda, but never married.         Mrs. Harrington learned to play the keyboard at Philadelphia's Settlement Music School. Soon afterward, she decided to take her newfound skill downtown, where she played for change on the sidewalk in front of Wanamaker's department store. But Atlantic City -- bustling with tourists and extra change -- beckoned. She arrived on the Boardwalk in 1984, and she eventually moved into a condominium in Atlantic City purchased with the proceeds from her busking.         She often boasted that as much as $100,000 a year was dropped into her plastic bucket, though friends and relatives gently dispute that claim.         Though Mrs. Harrington eventually started a tiny enterprise designing business cards, her main interest was her music, and her repertoire of solemn ballads like ''Somewhere Over the Rainbow,'' and patriotic hymns like ''America the Beautiful,'' quickly made her a redemptive presence in a gambling town. They also won her a following among the Boardwalk's casual strollers.         By 1989, Mrs. Harrington was a beloved presence, partly because of the remarkable figure she cut: a 4-foot, 10-inch tall, 190-pound woman moving swiftly, lying on her stomach, head up, , through the city streets on a motorized gurney that she guided with a steering device worked by her chin. But she was also known for the inspirational message she spread as a guest on national talk shows or to people she met on the Boardwalk with whom she formed close relationships.         Among them was her husband, Roy Harrington, a casino maintenance man who came along in 1990. In the next year, the couple married and adopted Charles Graves, the son of a former boyfriend.         In addition to her husband and three children, Mrs. Harrington is survived by two sisters, Agnes Tate-Sanders and Tamogene Tate, both of Philadelphia, and a brother, Jay-Cee Tate of North Carolina.         Another person that Mrs. Harrington befriended was Camille LeClair, co-owner of a McDonald's restaurant in Atlantic City who hired her last year to take phone deliveries.         A poignant memory of Mrs. Harrington was on her mind last week when word came that she had died. On one occasion when Mrs. Harrington was in her house, Mrs. LeClair said: ''I hopped in the shower and when I came back I said to Celestine, 'Why does God allow me to jump in and out of the shower in 10 minutes, but you have to struggle so much?'  Well, Celestine just looked at me and said, 'That's why I'm here. To keep reminding you to count your blessings every day.' ''       
         Leonie Rysanek, the Austrian dramatic soprano whose illustrious international career spanned nearly 40 years, died on Saturday at a hospital in Vienna, the city of her birth, where she lived all her life. She was 71.         She had been battling bone cancer, according to Peter S. Diggins, an artists' representative in New York and a longtime friend.         It was during Ms. Rysanek's final performances at the Metropolitan Opera in late 1995 and early 1996 in a new production of Tchaikovsky's ''Pique Dame'' that she received confirmation of her cancer diagnosis. But she told few people about it.         The scope of Ms. Rysanek's career was remarkable: she sang with the conductor Wilhelm Furtwangler during his final years in the early 1950's, and with the tenor Jussi Bjoerling in his prime. Yet she was still singing ardently in the early 1990's. She possessed a gleaming, refulgent soprano voice with an especially powerful top and a rich middle range, ideal for roles like Wagner's Sieglinde and Senta, Strauss's Chrysothemis, and Beethoven's Leonora.         Her full-voiced high notes could slice through the thickness of any Strauss orchestra. In her early days, her low voice was often criticized as patchy. But as she matured, her sound darkened and deepened, and she successfully took on lower-set roles like Wagner's Kundry in ''Parsifal.''         Ms. Rysanek's work was equally prized for its dramatic and musical intensity. Speaking of Ms. Rysanek at the time of her Met farewell, the conductor James Levine, a frequent colleague, said such longevity was striking for a singer of her fervor.         ''She had a fire burning in her at all times,'' Mr. Levine said. ''It's remarkable for someone to combine such intensity with a voice of such resiliency and range,'' he added. ''Somehow there is a very womanly, soft-textured quality in Leonie's singing, even in its most forceful moments.''         Her approach to singing was not classically beautiful. Reporting on her 25th-anniversary Met gala in 1984, when she sang Kundry in Act II of ''Parsifal'' and Sieglinde in Act I of ''Walkure'' in a concert with Mr. Levine conducting, The New York Times critic John Rockwell wrote that Ms. Rysanek ''has never been a singer who stresses an even vocal line and abstract bel-canto virtues. She is an Expressionistic actress, given to splintering significant words under the stress of emotion and to wrenching her body and chopping her arms in a way that inevitably distorts her singing. But the result, a few mannerisms aside, is not the disruption of the music but the enhancement of the drama.''         Ms. Rysanek credited her longevity to careful pacing; even at the height of her career, she never sang more than 45 or so performances a year. But, in an interview with The Times on the occasion of her Met farewell, she also cited her ability to say no to the most taxing roles. And, in a way, she explained, the presence of her colleague Birgit Nilsson as the reigning dramatic soprano of her day, fortified her own resolve.         ''Yes, I was asked to sing Brunnhilde,'' she said. ''But there was always Birgit, wonderful Birgit, next to me. She was my Brunnhilde, my Elektra. She was so wonderful in these parts. . . . Even Birgit asked, 'Why don't you sing Turandot?' I said, 'Because of you.' Maybe's it's Birgit who saved my voice.''         Ms. Rysanek was born in Vienna on Nov. 14, 1926, one of six children of a Czech father, a stonecutter, later a chauffeur, and an Austrian mother. As a adolescent during the war years, Ms. Rysanek had to work in a munitions factory. She aspired to be an actress. But her oldest brother, who had a pleasant baritone voice, encouraged her to take her singing seriously. She entered the Vienna Academy at 16, where she studied with Alfred Jerger, and later, Rudolf Grossmann, a baritone who became her first husband. They couple later divorced.         Her professional debut was at Innsbruck in 1949 as Agathe in Weber's ''Der Freischutz.'' But international acclaim came in 1951, when she sang Sieglinde in the first postwar production at Bayreuth, Germany, of Wagner's ''Ring.'' Her American debut was in 1956 with the San Francisco Opera as Senta.         A long association with the Met began in 1959, unexpectedly. She was scheduled to make her debut that season in late February as Aida. But when Maria Callas, who had been scheduled to sing Verdi's Lady Macbeth in the Met's first production of the opera, was fired by the general manager Rudolf Bing during a bitter contractual dispute, Bing asked Ms. Rysanek to take over the role. Leonard Warren was Macbeth; Erich Leinsdorf was the conductor; the night was Feb. 5, and the audience had been expecting Callas.         ''I was hesitant to debut in a production made for Callas,'' Ms. Rysanek said during an 1996 interview in The Times. ''I already had a major success in Europe. But in New York, the attitude was: 'Who are you? Who knows you? How dare you?' ''         When she made her first entrance, someone shouted, ''Brava, Callas!'' Ms. Rysanek was not rattled. ''I said to myself, 'If he is against me, I will show him my high C's.' So I sat on that high C, which is incorrect.'' Her performance was a triumph.         The next season, in 1960, singing Senta in Wagner's ''Fliegende Hollander,'' Ms. Rysanek solidified her claim on Met audiences. The Dutchman was George London. At the end of Act II, the reception was rapturous; a large contingent of fans kept applauding through the intermission, until the conductor Thomas Schippers returned to the pit to begin Act III.         By the late 1960's, she was giving most of her services to her two favorite companies: the Vienna State Opera, where she sang a total of 532 performances, and the Met, where during 37 years she sang 299 performances of 24 roles.         At the Vienna State Opera in 1977, and later at the Met, in one of her most renowned portrayals, Ms. Rysanek sang the Empress in Strauss's operatic fable ''Die Frau Ohne Schatten,'' with Ms. Nilsson as a dyer's wife. This work had been considered muddled and musically cumbersome until these powerful soprano champions sang it. A pirated recording of their Vienna performance, conducted by Karl Bohm, circulated among collectors until Deutsche Grammophon released it commercially in 1985. It is one of the most treasured of Ms. Rysanek's many recordings.         After her 25th-anniversary gala at the Met, Ms. Rysanek returned almost every season, singing a particularly memorable Kundry in 1985 to the great Parsifal of the tenor Jon Vickers. In 1992, at 66, she gave a searing performance in Janacek's ''Jenufa'' as Kostelnicka, a Moravian villager so ashamed of her stepdaughter's out-of-wedlock son that she drowns the infant in a stream.         Ms. Rysanek is survived by her husband of nearly 30 years, Ernst-Ludwig Gausmann, a former journalist; a stepson, Marcus Gausmann; a brother, Kurt, and sister, Lotte Rysanek, who was a lyric soprano with the Vienna State Opera.         The role of Ms. Rysanek's Met farewell, when she was 69, was the old countess in ''Pique Dame,'' which is ''vocally almost nothing,'' she conceded at the time. But dramatically, her portrayal dominated Elijah Moshinsky's haunting production. Even after the character's death, Ms. Rysanek's ghostly countess was a riveting presence. Her ovation lasted for 40 minutes.       
         Laurie Beechman, the throbbing-voiced singer and actress who played Grizabella in the Broadway musical ''Cats'' for more than five years, died on Sunday at her home in White Plains, N.Y. She was 44.         The cause was complications from ovarian cancer, said her agent and friend, Jim Wilhelm.         An emotive belter in the tradition of Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand, both of whom were her girlhood idols, Ms. Beechman brought a waifish pathos and a piercing vocal power to her character's signature song, ''Memory.''         Whether on Broadway, on a concert stage or in a cabaret, Ms. Beechman conveyed a strong involvement with her material, delivering the climaxes of big ballads with a full-throated, sobbing intensity.         Ms. Beechman was born in Philadelphia, attended New York University and made her Broadway debut in 1977 in the ensemble of ''Annie.''         Venturing into the pop arena, she  made an album, ''Laurie and the Sighs'' (Atlantic), that presented her as a rock belter in the mode of Pat Benatar. When the album sold poorly, she decided to stick to the worlds of theater and cabaret and returned to Broadway as the narrator in ''Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat.'' Her performance in that show won her Tony and Drama Desk nominations for best featured actress in a musical.         In 1983 she took the role of Grizabella in the national touring company of ''Cats'' with the proviso that she step into the part on Broadway when Betty Buckley departed. The chance came four months later.         In the late 1980's and 90's, Ms. Beechman became a cabaret and concert performer who often blended popular standards and theater songs with light rock-and-roll. She also recorded four more albums.         Ovarian cancer was diagnosed in 1989. Despite her illness, she joined the national touring company of ''Les Miserables'' in the role of Fantine, performing in the touring production of ''The Music of Andrew Lloyd Webber: The Sunset Edition,'' and singing ''You'll Never Walk Alone'' at President Clinton's 1997 inaugural gala. Last spring she rejoined ''Cats'' in time to be playing Grizabella when the show surpassed ''A Chorus Line'' as Broadway's longest-running hit.         She is survived by her husband, Neil Mazzella; her parents, Dr. Nathan and Dolly Beechman Schnall of Philadelphia, and two sisters, Jane Segal and Claudia Cohen, both of Philadelphia. A funeral will be held tomorrow at 11 A.M. at J.  Levine and Sons Memorial Chapel, 7112 North Broad Street, Philadelphia.         Ms. Beechman became an advocate and role model for people with cancer. ''The perception people have of cancer,'' she told The New York Times, ''is that you're cured or you die, and that's not necessarily how it works. It can be more like diabetes, a part of life.''       
         Eleanor Shuman, who was too young to remember more than the screams but recalled them vividly for more than 85 years, died on Saturday at a hospital near her home in Elgin, Ill. She was 87 and one of the last half-dozen survivors of the sinking of the Titanic.         Mrs. Shuman, whose original name was Johnson, was just 18 months old when the Titanic went down in the early hours of April 15, 1912, with the loss of more than 1,500 lives, but as one of 705 survivors, she had a tale to tell and told it often over the years.         For the most part, Mrs. Shuman lived a fairly ordinary life in the Chicago suburbs. A native of St. Charles, Ill., where her father, Oscar Johnson, was a newspaper editor, she moved to nearby Elgin, working for a while at the Elgin Watch Company before becoming a telephone operator until she retired in 1962. Her husband, Delbert Shuman, an International Harvester engineer, died in 1981. They had been married for 47 years.         Through it all Mrs. Shuman kept her memories of the Titanic alive. The living room of her tidy little house in Elgin had what she called her Titanic Corner, including books, a painting of the Titanic and a photograph showing her and her older brother, Harold, at the New York premiere of the Titanic movie ''A Night to Remember'' in 1958.         More recently Mrs. Shuman had acquired other souvenirs, photographs showing her and James Cameron, the director of the current hit movie ''Titanic,'' at the Chicago premiere last December.         As the only Titanic survivor Mr. Cameron met, Mrs. Shuman got royal treatment. She saw the movie three times, first at a screening along with the television movie critics Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert, then at the premiere and later at a theater in Elgin. She said she cried each time.         The movie and the attendant publicity made Mrs. Shuman such a sought-after celebrity that she changed her telephone number to an unlisted one after getting as many as 10 calls a day from people wanting to hear her recollections about the Titanic or simply to speak with someone who had survived the disaster.         But she recalled very little about the fateful night. Most of the details she related over the years came from her mother, Alice, but Mrs. Shuman insisted she recalled the screams and the sight from a great height of a sea of hands reaching up for her from a lifeboat below.         As Mrs. Shuman recounted it, the voyage on the Titanic came about by accident. She, her mother and her 4-year-old brother, Harold, had gone to Finland to visit her mother's dying father and other relatives and were on their way back to the United States when they stopped over in England and discovered that their passage on another ship had been canceled because of a coal miners' strike.         Learning that the Titanic had room, the family, along with two teen-age girls they had met in Sweden, hopped a boat-train to Southampton and bought third-class tickets just hours before the Titanic sailed.         Drawing on her mother's account, Mrs. Shuman recalled that at first the disaster had provided a moment of recreation for the third-class passengers.         When the Titanic struck the iceberg, she said, tons of ice went on the deck, right outside their cabin door. As her mother, the Swedish girls and others playfully kicked the ice around, an officer shooed them back into their cabins, saying the ship would get underway shortly.         A little later, she said, the steward who had waited on them in the dining room and apparently taken a liking to the little group knocked on their door and escorted them to the boat deck.         Her mother, carrying her daughter in her arms, was helped into a lifeboat, and little Harold, who had been carried to the deck by one of the Swedish girls, was dropped down into the boat after them. The other Swedish girl had gotten into another lifeboat and survived, she said, but the one who had been holding her brother went down with the ship.         Theirs, she said, was the last lifeboat to leave the Titanic. Five hours later they were picked up by the ship Carpathia and taken to New York.         Until a few years ago when she visited her son, then living in Florida, Mrs. Shuman had not seen the Atlantic since 1912. In 1996 she sailed back to the site of the disaster for a memorial service.         With Mrs. Shuman's death, there are now five known living Titanic survivors. Karen Kamuda of the Titanic Historical Society in Indian Orchard, Mass., said they are Barbara West and Millzina Dean of England; Michael Navratil of France; and Lillian Asplund and Winnifred Tongerloo of the United States.         Mrs. Shuman, whose brother died in 1968, is survived by a son, Earl, of St. Charles, Ill., two sisters, Irene Van Thournout of St. Charles and Esther Rudder of Connecticut, and two grandchildren.       
         Beatrice Wood, a ceramic artist known as much for her irreverent quips, beauty, bohemian life style and famous lovers as for her luminous luster-glaze chalices, and who  inspired at least two movie characters, died on Thursday at her home in Ojai, Calif. She had celebrated her 105th birthday on March 3.         An independent woman inclined to say whatever was on her mind, Ms. Wood famously attributed her longevity to ''chocolate and young men'' and just as memorably titled her 1985 autobiography ''I Shock Myself.'' In fact she was a lifelong vegetarian who neither smoked nor drank and remained clear-minded enough to take up the computer at the age of 90.         Until two years ago, she worked at the potter's wheel every day, following a strict daily regimen in a studio that was listed under ''Places of Interest'' in Ojai. A member of the Theosophy movement since 1923, she had moved to Ojai in 1948 to be near its leader, the Indian sage Krishnamurti. For the last four decades of her life, she dressed exclusively in bright Indian saris and wore large amounts of silver-and-turquoise jewelry, even when throwing pots, with her thick, hip-length gray hair twisted into braids or a bun.         She was born in San Francisco and  reared in New York, and demonstrated an early affinity for art and nonconformity, much to the dismay of wealthy parents. She once said that she was 23 before she got free of her mother and her lady's maid, but she was allowed to go, chaperoned, to Paris when she was 18, where she studied painting at the Academie Julien and acting at the Comedie Francaise. Back in New York she fell in with some of the most adventurous artistic characters in town.         Her friends included Man Ray, Francis Picabia, Charles Sheeler, Walter and Louise Arensberg, Edgard Varese and Mina Loy. She was closest to Marcel Duchamp and his friend, the diplomat and writer Henri-Pierre Roche. The three founded  Blind Man, a magazine that was one of the earliest manifestations of the Dada art movement in New York. (In the second and last issue, Ms. Wood defended Duchamp's infamous  urinal, rejected by the jury of the 1917 Independents exhibition, with a sentence usually attributed to Duchamp himself: ''The only works of art America has given are her plumbing and her bridges.'') Duchamp encouraged her to draw; the results were fey, often autobiographical caricatures.         Her life was already the stuff of movies. Roche's novel about a menage a trois, ''Jules et Jim,'' would inspire Francois Truffaut's 1961 movie of the same name, with the character played by Jeanne Moreau based in part on Ms. Wood. In 1993, she was the subject of a documentary, ''Beatrice Wood, the Mama of Dada,'' directed by Diandra Douglas. And more recently, she inspired the 101-year-old character of Rose in the movie ''Titanic,'' directed by James Cameron, a neighbor in Ojai.         Ms. Wood liked to say that she had loved seven men she didn't marry and married two men she didn't love,  saying that neither marriage was consummated. Her first, in 1919, to a theater manager from Montreal, resulted from family pressure and soon ended in annulment when it was discovered that the man already had a wife in Belgium. In 1938, while living in Los Angeles, she married Steve Hoag, an engineer, after a house they owned together in North Hollywood was swept away in a flood, on the correct theory that married people were likely to get Red Cross relief more easily. He lived with her until his death in 1960.         She was a late-bloomer as an artist and did not encounter ceramics until the 1930's, when she failed to find a teapot to match some neo-Rococo luster-glaze plates she had bought in Holland.         She enrolled in a pottery course at Hollywood High School, and began to research the luster-glaze process in a local library.         She never made that teapot, but became fascinated with the process.  Her first works -- small glazed figures whose whimsy echoed her drawings -- sold easily, helping her make it through the Depression. It was not until 1940, when she studied  briefly with the Austrian ceramicists Gertrud and Otto Natzler, that she began to appreciate the beauty and possibilities of ceramics as an art form.         After settling in Ojai in 1948, she began develop her own version of the unpredictable luster glaze technique, extending a process that embedded the metallic irridescence in the glaze itself, rather than painting it on. While she didn't invent the technique, she did create a unique palette in an extraordinary range of metallic pinks, golds and greens.         At first Ms. Wood supported herself by turning out large quantities of dinner sets, but after the mid 1970's, she was able to concentrate exclusively on more ambitious decorative vessels: chalices, bowls and vases. Her most complex pieces, which had elaborately decorated surfaces,  came only after the mid-1980's, when she was in her 90's. These elaborate, radiant works dominate her most recent retrospective, held last year at the American Craft Museum in New York. The show opens in Florida at the Lake Worth Museum of Contemporary Art on March 27.         Ms. Wood had her first exhibition in 1949 at America House in New York. Her museum exhibitions include a retrospective at the Phoenix Art Museum in 1973. Since 1981, she has had repeated exhibitions at the Garth Clark Gallery, first in Los Angeles and then in New York, where an exhibition of her work will close on April 4.         In 1994, the Smithsonian Institution named Ms. Wood an Esteemed American Artist and Pete Wilson, Governor of California, declared her a ''California Living Treasure.''       
         Bella S. Abzug, New Yorker, feminist, antiwar activist, politician and lawyer, died yesterday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 77.         She died of complications following heart surgery, said Harold Holzer, who was her spokesman when she served in Congress. She had been hospitalized for weeks, and had been in poor health for several years, he said.         Ms. Abzug represented the West Side of Manhattan for three Congressional terms in the 1970's. She  brought with her a belligerent, exuberant politics that made her a national character. Often called just Bella, she was recognizable everywhere by her big hats and a voice that Norman Mailer said ''could boil the fat off a taxicab driver's neck.''         She opposed the Vietnam War, championed what was then called women's liberation and was one of the first to call for the impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon. Long after it ceased to be fashionable, she called her politics radical. During her last campaign, for Congress in 1986, she told The New York Times, ''I am not a centrist.''         Bella Abzug was a founding feminist, and an enduring one. In the movement's giddy, sloganeering early days, Ms. Abzug was, like Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem, an icon, the hat bobbing before the cameras at marches and rallies.         After leaving the House in January 1977, she worked for women's rights for two more decades. She founded an international women's group that worked on environmental issues. And she was a leader of a conference of nongovernmental organizations that paralleled the United Nations' fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing in 1995.         Even then, she continued to rankle.  Former President George Bush, on a private visit to China that coincided with the Beijing conference, said to a meeting of food production executives: ''I feel somewhat sorry for the Chinese, having Bella Abzug running around. Bella Abzug is one who has always represented the extremes of the women's movement.''         When told of Mr. Bush's remark, Ms. Abzug, 75 and in a wheelchair, retorted: ''He was addressing a fertilizer group? That's appropriate.''         Her forceful personality and direct manner made her a lightning rod for criticism from those who opposed the idea of holding a women's conference. After Bob Dole, then the Senate majority leader, said he could not imagine why anyone ''would want to attend a conference co-chaired by Bella Abzug,'' she responded that she was not running the meeting but simply participating with more than 30,000 other women over how best to achieve equal rights.         But much of what Ms. Abzug agitated for -- abortion rights, day care, laws against employment discrimination -- was by that time mainstream political fare.         In Congress, ''she was first on almost everything, on everything that ever mattered,'' said Esther Newberg, Ms. Abzug's first administrative assistant and one of many staff members who quit but remained devoted. ''She was first to call for Richard Nixon's impeachment, first to call for an end to the war.''         Ms. Abzug made enemies easily -- ''Sometimes the hat and the mouth took over,'' Ms. Newberg said -- but Ms. Abzug saw that as a consequence of a refusal to compromise, as well as a matter of sport. Of her time in the House, Ms. Abzug wrote in a journal that was published in 1972 as ''Bella,'' ''I spend all day figuring out how to beat the machine and knock the crap out of the political power structure.''         She worked relentlessly at organizing and coalition-building. A founder of Women Strike for Peace and the National Women's Political Caucus, she spent a lifetime prodding for change, with a lawyer's enthusiasm for political channels, through organizations from the P.T.A. to the United Nations.         She made friends easily, too. ''She's fierce and intense and funny,'' said her longtime friend Gloria Steinem. ''She takes everyone seriously. When she argues with you fiercely, it's because she takes you seriously. And she's willing to change her mind. That's so rare.''         Her First Speech, In a Subway Station         Bella Savitzky Abzug was born on July 24, 1920 in the Bronx, the second daughter of Jewish immigrants from Russia. Her father, Emanuel Savitzky, whom Ms. Abzug later described as ''this humanist butcher,'' ran (and named) the Live and Let Live Meat Market on Ninth Avenue in Manhattan.         She said she knew from the age of 11 that she wanted to be a lawyer, and not long afterward gave her first public speech, in a subway station, while collecting for a Zionist youth organization. She went from Hunter College, where she was student body president, to Columbia University Law School, where she was an editor of The Law Review, to a practice representing union workers.         Ms. Abzug traced the wearing of her trademark wide-brimmed hats to those days. She once recalled: ''When I was a young lawyer, I would go to people's offices and they would always say: 'Sit here. We'll wait for the lawyer.' Working women wore hats. It was the only way they would take you seriously.         ''After a while, I started liking them. When I got to Congress, they made a big thing of it. So I was watching. Did they want me to wear it or not? They didn't want me to wear it, so I did.''         All the while, she was a leftist and an agitator. Later, exasperated with her Congressional aides, she wrote: ''I just don't understand young people today, quite frankly. Our struggle was political, ideological and economic, and we felt we couldn't make something of ourselves unless we bettered society. We saw the two together.''         In the 1950's, Ms. Abzug's law practice turned to other cases identified with the left. One client was Willie McGee, a black Mississippian convicted of raping a white woman and sentenced to death. Ms. Abzug, who was pregnant at the time, argued the case in Mississippi while white supremacist groups threatened her. Though the Supreme Court stayed the execution twice, Mr. McGee was eventually executed.         She also represented people accused of Communist activities by Senator Joseph McCarthy's Congressional committee and its counterpart in Albany.         In the 1960's, Ms. Abzug became an antiwar activist. A founder of Women Strike for Peace, she became its chief lobbyist, protesting nuclear testing and, later, the Vietnam War. She organized insurgent Democrats into other groups, too, becoming a leader of the movement against President Lyndon B. Johnson and a prominent figure in the 1968 Presidential campaign of Senator Eugene McCarthy.         During those years, Ms. Abzug started navigating New York City politics. She and her husband, Martin, moved from Mount Vernon, the Westchester suburb where they had raised their two daughters, to a town house at 37 Bank Street in Greenwich Village. In 1970, Ms. Abzug ran for Congress.         The 19th Congressional District, which snaked from lower Manhattan  to the West 80's, had four registered Democrats to every Republican and had been represented in Congress for seven terms by Leonard Farbstein, a  solid but rather somnolent liberal. Ms. Abzug won the Democratic primary with 54 percent of the vote.         Campaign Became A Women's Crusade         At this point, Bella Abzug became national news, a flash of local color in a political year. She seemed to be everywhere, clapping backs and jabbing biceps. Her campaign headquarters next to the Lion's Head, a writers' and journalists' bar in Greenwich Village, was also a day-care center for her legions of female volunteers. The women's crusade she led brought considerable, if sometimes derisive, attention.         Though she eventually took 55 percent of the vote, she had genuine Republican opposition, unusual in an era when New York's main political action consisted of various Democratic factions knifing one another. The Republican-Liberal candidate was Barry Farber, a well-known radio talk show host. Mr. Farber drew many Democrats who resented Mr. Farbstein's humiliation or were simply put off by Ms. Abzug's style.         To her chagrin, Mr. Farber accused Ms. Abzug, who advocated direct negotiations between Israelis and Arabs, of flagging in her support of Israel. For years after that, she made a point of stating her Jewish credentials, dating to childhood: her family was religious and she went regularly to synagogue (though she was bothered that women were relegated to the back rows of the balcony), studied Hebrew and was enrolled for a time at the Jewish Theological Seminary.         When Ms. Abzug went to Washington, she sought an appointment to the Armed Services Committee. She wanted a resolution calling for an immediate withdrawal from Vietnam and she vowed to take on the military-industrial complex. She wanted to end the draft. She wanted national health insurance, money for  day-care centers and housing, and more money for New York City, all to be paid for with billions siphoned from the Pentagon's budget.         She got little of this, but during the next six years ''she was indefatigable,'' Ms. Newberg recalled. ''She yelled a lot,only because she couldn't get everything done.'' And if she couldn't, Ms. Newberg added, it was partly because ''her agenda was too pure for her moment in time.''         Ms. Abzug did become expert at parliamentary rules, worked them skillfully and was famously well prepared for every vote, hearing and committee spat. The ''sunshine law'' requiring governing bodies to meet publicly came out of a subcommittee she headed. She coaxed funds for New York from the Public Works Committee. She was a co-sponsor of  the women's equal rights amendment. ''She was one of the most exciting, enlightened legislators that ever served in the Congress,'' said Representative Charles B. Rangel of Manhattan, with whom Ms. Abzug sometimes collaborated and sometimes sparred.         From her first day on Capitol Hill -- the day she dismayed her colleagues by introducing her Vietnam resolution -- Ms. Abzug derided the Congressional club, the seniority system, the log-rolling and back-scratching. She did not spare fellow Democrats; when she spoke of liberals, it was usually dismissively. She badgered the House leadership over committee appointments and votes.         She badgered the President, too. Invited to a reception at Richard Nixon's White House, she accepted (while writing in her journal, ''Who wants to listen to his pious idiocies?''), then announced to Nixon in the receiving line that her constituents demanded a withdrawal from Vietnam.         For all of her railing against Democrats who went along to get along,  Speaker Thomas P. O'Neill named her one of his dozen assistant whips, and by most accounts she worked well with some of the crustiest fixtures in the House.         Still, a 1972 report by Ralph Nader  estimated that Ms. Abzug's sponsorship of a measure often cost it 20 to 30 votes. Her reputation as an irritant came from all quarters. Jimmy Breslin wrote of a campaign worker who repaired to the Lion's Head one night, holding his side and swearing never to work for Ms. Abzug again. ''She punched me,'' he explained, in a quarrel over scheduling. The next day, Mr. Breslin reported, Ms. Abzug called the aide. ''Michael, I called to apologize,'' she said. ''How's your kidney?''         Mr. Breslin also recounted the Congresswoman's introduction to Sol Linowitz, the former chairman of the Xerox Corporation and a Democratic Party luminary: ''Are you the man that used to be head of the Xerox?'' Ms. Abzug asked. ''That's right,'' Mr. Linowitz replied. ''I'm glad to meet a big shot,'' Ms. Abzug said. ''I'm in hock $35,000 on my campaign.''         Ms. Abzug acknowledged loneliness in her years in Congress. ''Outside of Martin and the kids, I don't feel very related to most people at this point,'' she wrote in 1971. ''I feel detached in social situations. I'm always thinking about other things, about Congress, about the issues, about the political coalition I'm trying to organize. It never leaves me. I even have trouble relating to some of my closest friends, though God knows I still love them, even if they don't know it.''         Always, she returned to Manhattan to spend weekends with her husband.         She had married Martin Abzug in 1944. The two New Yorkers met on a bus in Miami, when both were on the way to a Yehudi Menuhin concert. Mr. Abzug, a stockbroker and an author of two published novels, had next to no interest in politics. In an interview in 1970, he murmured, while his wife was out of the room, ''The political bug is a curious bug.'' But he was, she said, her best friend and supporter, and ''one of the few unneurotic people left in society.''         Corrosive Ambition Hampers a Career         Ms. Abzug's own ambition was too corrosive for many people, even -- or, perhaps, especially -- for her fellow New York Democrats. When the State Legislature sliced up her district in 1972, they urged her to challenge one of the two conservative incumbent Democrats in adjoining districts, Representative John J. Rooney or Representative John M. Murphy. Instead, she opposed a liberal Democrat, William Fitts Ryan, in the 20th District, encompassing the Upper West Side and the Riverdale section of the Bronx.         The primary was bitter and, eventually, politically expensive to Ms. Abzug. Bill Ryan was one of the earliest heroes of the city's insurgent Democrats, an early opponent of the  Vietnam War and a genuinely well-liked man who, as many of his constituents knew, was waging a gallant fight against cancer.         Mr. Ryan defeated Ms. Abzug in the Democratic primary but died before the general election. The Democratic County Committee appointed Ms. Abzug as the candidate to replace him, but she was challenged by Mr. Ryan's widow, Priscilla, who ran on the Liberal line. Ms. Abzug won in November, but she had made dedicated enemies who believed she was an overly aggressive politician who would not hesitate to attack anyone who got in her way. Ten years later, she was denied a seat in the state's delegation to the national party's biannual conference because New York leaders considered her disruptive.         In 1976, she gave up her House seat to run for the Senate. She lost in the primary, to Daniel Patrick Moynihan, by a margin of only 1 percent. Two more campaigns quickly followed. (In a 1978 interview, she said: ''I'm a politician. I run for office. That's my profession.'') She lost to Edward I. Koch in a crowded mayoral primary in 1977. The next year, running for the House again, she lost, again by just 1 percent, to a little-known Republican, S. William Green.         She was appointed co-chairwoman  of President Jimmy Carter's National Advisory Committee on Women, and then, after disagreeing with him over economic policy, was dismissed. The majority of the committee members resigned in protest. Ms. Abzug, unapologetic, said with a shrug, ''I've got to find myself another big, nonpaying job.''         Her next and last campaign was in 1986, this time for a House seat in Westchester County. She won the primary in a burst of the old, ebullient campaigning style, but lost in November to Joseph J. DioGuardi, the Republican incumbent.         It was during that campaign that Martin Abzug died. Her friends said Ms. Abzug never recovered. Nine years later, she said, , ''I haven't been entirely the same since.''         There was one more bid for office, for her old House seat on the Upper West Side, when she announced her candidacy to replace Representative Ted Weiss on his death just before the 1992 election. But she was quickly eliminated from the field at the party convention.         During the next decade, Ms. Abzug suffered from ill health, including breast cancer, but continued to practice law and work for women's groups. She wrote a book, ''Gender Gap,'' with her old friend Mim Kelber. She started a lobbying group called Women U.S.A. and founded the Women's Environment and Development Organization, a group that works with international agencies.         In addition to her daughters, Eve and Liz, Ms. Abzug is survived by her sister, Helene Alexander of Great Neck, N.Y.         ''I've been described as a tough and noisy woman, a prizefighter, a man hater, you name it,'' Ms. Abzug said of herself in ''Bella.'' ''They call me Battling Bella, Mother Courage and a Jewish mother with more complaints than Portnoy.''         ''There are those who say I'm impatient, impetuous, uppity, rude, profane, brash and overbearing. Whether I'm any of these things or all of them, you can decide for yourself. But whatever I am -- and this ought to be made very clear at the outset -- I am a very serious woman.''       
         Baroness Lestor of Eccles, a crusading British politician who spoke out against apartheid in defiance of her Government's policies and who struck a blow on behalf of single mothers when she won the right to adopt two children on her own, died in a hospice in London on Friday. She was 66 and had been suffering from motor neurone disease.         Lady Lestor had two great causes in her life: the fight against racism and the fight for the rights of children, and was never afraid to criticize her party when she disagreed with its policies.         She was briefly chairman of the Labor Party in 1977-78 and served as a junior minister in several Labor Governments in the early 1970's, but was perhaps too uncompromising in her beliefs to rise to a higher office. She was, an admirer once said, ''the heart and soul of the Labor Party.''         Joan Lestor was born on Nov. 13, 1931, in Vancouver, British Columbia, to parents steeped in the international labor movement. Her mother, Esther, had been a machinist in a textile factory in East London who, as a teen-ager, became a shop steward for the garment workers' union; her father, Charles, a journalist and actor, was a leading member of the Canadian Socialist Party and later, when the family returned to England, of the Socialist Party of Great Britain.         Ms. Lestor graduated from London University with a diploma in sociology and went to work as a nursery school teacher, opening a nursery school in her own home six years later. At the same time she pursued a career in politics. Disillusioned by what she considered the extremism of her father's party, she joined Labor at the age of 24, won several local elections and was elected to Parliament in 1966. She remained there, with a four-year break, until 1997.         She immediately threw herself into the issues that consumed her, introducing a bill to tighten regulations on nursery schools and providers of child care; fighting the Government's attempt to stop paying social security benefits to unwed mothers, and working to insure that abandoned wives could obtain financial support from their husbands.         She was passionate about the rights of abused children, saying in a 1989 debate that while it was necessary to ''strike a balance'' between the rights of children and the rest of the family, ''in my book, the rights of the children are paramount.''         Her jobs in the Labor Governments of Harold Wilson and James Callaghan often became jeopardized by the rigor of her principles. In 1974, when she was appointed a junior minister in the Foreign Office with special responsibility for African affairs, she earned the nickname ''the African Queen'' and repeatedly clashed with her superiors over her strong anti-apartheid views.         Ms. Lestor was then moved to a ministerial job in the Education Department. But she resigned after a year in protest over spending cuts that threatened the jobs of thousands of teachers and forced the postponement of her goal to change the age when students left state-financed secondary schools to 16, from 15.         With the Conservatives in power through the 1980's and into the 1990's, Ms. Lestor worked as the opposition's chief spokeswoman on a number of issues, including children and the family, juvenile crime and race relations. She resigned from her last opposition post, as spokeswoman for overseas development, in 1996, saying that she was too ill to continue.         In 1997 she was made a Baroness and elevated to the House of Lords.         A flamboyant, warmhearted woman who listed her hobbies in Who's Who as ''playing with children and animals,'' Lady Lestor relished adversarial politics and was not shy about telling people what she thought, in the plainest possible language.         When she heard that Rupert Allason, a fellow Member of Parliament and an espionage expert, was about to accuse her publicly of spying for the K.G.B., she confronted him and showered him with invective. ''Perhaps I used words no lady should,'' she conceded later.         She was married briefly as a teen-ager in 1948, but the marriage was dissolved and she never remarried. She wanted children, nonetheless, and fought for the right to adopt them herself, despite being single.         When she won her case, she cried with happiness, and went on to adopt her son, David, in 1967, and her daughter, Susan, in 1969. She loved being a grandmother, and caused roars of laughter in Parliament when she announced, in a wicked nod at Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who had grandly used the royal ''we'' in noting the birth of her first grandchild, that ''we too became a grandmother.''         When she received her peerage, she said she celebrated by baking muffins for her grandchildren; having them, she said, was ''even better than being in love.''       
         Felicie Young Cormier and Marie-Louise Febronie Meilleur, who lived through more tumultuous history, saw more social and technological change and endured more late-life congratulations than any two people known to be alive, died within two days of each other this week, ending their rival reigns as the world's oldest living person.         Mrs. Cormier, who had no birth certificate but traced her birth date through family records to Nov. 9, 1879, was 118 when she died two minutes before midnight on Tuesday at a nursing home in Crowley, La.         Mrs. Meilleur, who had a birth certificate and other proofs of age that qualified her for the oldest living person listing in the Guinness Book of World Records, was 117 when she died on Thursday afternoon at a nursing home in North Bay, Ontario.         Both women had received considerable attention during the last decade of parallel lives that had been devoted almost exclusively to their large families.         When Mrs. Cormier, the daughter of former slaves, was born in New Iberia, La., during Reconstruction, Rutherford B. Hayes was President of the 38 United States and Thomas Alva Edison had just invented the electric light bulb.         Sir John A. MacDonald, Canada's first Prime Minister, was in his second term when Mrs. Meilleur was born in Kamouraska, Quebec, on Aug. 29, 1880, 13 years after the consolidation of Canada.         The daughter of a fisherman who operated a hotel, Mrs. Meilleur, whose maiden name was Levesque, was educated at a local convent, married a man named Leclerc and had four children before her husband died of pneumonia in the early years of the century. In 1915 she married Hector Meilleur and moved to Rapide des Joachims, Quebec, where her husband worked as a forest ranger during the summer and as a lumberman during the winter, while Mrs. Meilleur had six more children, bringing her total to 10.         Mrs. Cormier recalled growing up at a time of such racial tension that after her family was given some land by a white woman grateful that little Felicie had nursed her through a bout of smallpox when no one else would take the job, the Ku Klux Klan drove the family away.         She later lived in Morgan City and New Orleans, where she met her husband, Joseph Ellis Cormier, who had six children when the couple were married. Together they had seven more children, but Mrs. Cormier, who brought up all 13, refused to make a distinction between the two sets of children and claimed them all as her own.         Mrs. Cormier, who lived in her own house in Crowley, attended only by a part-time nursing assistant, until she entered the nursing home last September, was inevitably glib during the annual spate of birthday interviews.         In recent years this gave her something of an edge over Mrs. Meilleur, who had been virtually blind and deaf since entering the nursing home in 1989.         Mrs. Meilleur's family, though, kept better records. In addition to four children, Gabriel Vaugh of Barrie, Olive Therrien of Peterborough, Rita Coote of Deep River and Ernie Meilleur, who lives in the same nursing home his mother lived in, Mrs. Meilleur is survived by 85 grandchildren, 80 great-grandchildren, 57 great-great-grandchildren and 4 great-great-great-grandchildren.         Mrs. Cormier, who claimed 37 grandchildren and 100 great-grandchildren a dozen years, had since lost count, said her son, Herbert, of Crowley.         Although she generally cited hard work as the reason for her longevity, Mrs. Meilleur, who was known to enjoy a glass of wine, had perhaps added to her life span when she quit smoking at the age of 90. Mrs. Cormier, her family said, neither smoked nor drank. She attributed her longevity to taking care of her self and going to bed early and getting up early.         For all the public interest in longevity, the deaths of the two women suggest a trend: the world's oldest people do not seem to be as old as they used to. The last oldest person,  Jeanne Louise Calment of France, was 122 at her death last August.       
         Linda Eastman McCartney, the wife of the former Beatle Paul McCartney and a photographer whose portraits of 1960's rock stars have become classics, died on Friday in Santa Barbara, Calif., where the McCartneys were vacationing. She was 56.         The cause was breast cancer that spread to her liver, said Geoff Baker, a family spokesman.         Besides her work as a photographer, Ms. McCartney performed as a keyboardist and backup singer in two of her husband's post-Beatles bands, Wings and the unnamed ensemble that toured in 1989 and 1993. She was a staunch campaigner for animal rights and vegetarianism and, starting in the late 1980's, she turned her passion for vegetarian cooking into an industry. She published two cookbooks, ''Linda McCartney's Home Cooking'' in 1989 and ''Linda's Kitchen'' in 1996, and in 1991 started a line of frozen vegetarian dinners.         As the wife of a musician who had long been a teen-age heartthrob and was the last Beatle to be married,  Ms. McCartney first attracted the ire of her husband's fans, and eventually the respect of many of them. When the McCartneys were married in London on March 12, 1969, hundreds of crying girls packed the sidewalk outside the Marylebone Register Office. Later, when she toured with Mr. McCartney, she took considerable criticism for her modest keyboard and vocal technique.         But the McCartneys' 29-year marriage was uncommonly steady by the standards of the celebrity world of which they were a part but from which they generally remained aloof, spending most of their time on a farm in West Sussex, England. They  never spent a night apart, except for the 10 days Mr. McCartney spent in a Tokyo jail after he was arrested for marijuana possession; indeed, their disinclination to be separated was part of Mr. McCartney's reason for having his wife in his touring band.         And Mr. McCartney, the composer of some of the rock era's most beautiful love songs, has consistently told interviewers that all his romantic  ballads written after 1968 were about Linda. Those songs include everything from ''Maybe I'm Amazed'' and ''The Lovely Linda'' on his first post-Beatles album, ''McCartney'' (1970), ''Long-Haired Lady'' on ''Ram'' (1971) and ''My Love'' on ''Red Rose Speedway'' (1973) to more recent songs like ''We Got Married'' and ''Figure of Eight'' on ''Flowers in the Dirt'' (1989) and ''Somedays'' on ''Flaming Pie'' (1997), his most recent studio album.         Mr. McCartney was not the first to compose a song about Ms. McCartney. Her father, Lee Eastman, was a prominent show business lawyer in New York and one of his clients, Jack Lawrence, wrote ''Linda'' for her in 1947 when she was 6. Buddy Clark had a hit with the song that year, and it was later recorded by Perry Como and Jan and Dean.         Ms. McCartney also wrote a few songs, including the reggae-style ''Seaside Woman,'' which she and Mr. McCartney released as a single in 1977 under the name Suzy and the Red Stripes, and ''The White-Coated Man,'' which she wrote with Carla Lane and released (also as Suzy and the Red Stripes) on an animal-rights charity disk, ''Animal Magnetism,'' in 1994.         She was born Linda Louise Eastman on September 24, 1941, and grew up in Scarsdale, N.Y. As she often pointed out, without ever dispelling the assertion entirely, she was not related to the Eastmans of the Eastman-Kodak photography empire. In fact, her father had changed his name from Epstein.         She described growing up in artistic and materialistic surroundings, with a status-conscious mother and a father whose friends and clients included the artist Willem de Kooning and the songwriters Hoagy Carmichael and Harold Arlen.         Ms. McCartney attended Sarah Lawrence College and the University of Arizona. While a student in Arizona, she married and had a daughter, but the marriage ended in 1963.         Soon afterward, she took up photography, and in 1965 she returned to New York, where she began photographing rock groups, starting with the Dave Clark Five and the Rolling Stones. During the next few years she befriended and photographed dozens of rock stars, including Jimi Hendrix, the Doors, the Animals, Janis Joplin, the Mamas and the Papas, Bob Dylan, Frank Zappa, the Beach Boys and the Grateful Dead. A widely reproduced picture of the Beatles that she took at a press party for the release of ''Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band'' in 1967 captured the group on the eve of its greatest artistic triumph.         Her photographs appeared in Rolling Stone and other rock magazines, and in 1992 she published several hundred of them as a book, ''Linda McCartney's Sixties: Portrait of an Era.''         Ms. McCartney met her future husband while photographing the Beatles in London in 1967, and the pair carried on an occasional romance for more than a year. In September 1968, Mr. McCartney asked her to move to London, from which point they became inseparable. Although she took some stunning pictures of the Beatles at work, she left most of them unpublished until she assembled her ''Sixties'' book. Her photographs of Mr. McCartney, however, adorned some of his post-Beatles album covers, and in one of his early television specials, ''James Paul McCartney,'' he is shown singing a medley of his songs while his wife did a photo shoot.         In addition to Mr. McCartney and the daughter from her first marriage, Heather, Ms. McCartney is survived by three children from her marriage with Mr. McCartney: Mary, Stella and James; and by her brother John, who is now Mr. McCartney's lawyer and business manager, and two sisters, Laura and Louise.         Besides ''Sixties,'' Ms. McCartney published several other books, including ''Linda's Pictures,'' ''Sun Prints,'' ''Photographs'' and ''Road Works.'' Celebrities were by no means her only photographic subject. Plants, animals, natural patterns on rock faces and people she encountered on her travels engaged her interest and were captured with a touching refinement in many of her pictures. Her work has also been the subject of exhibitions at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, the Royal Photographic Society in Bath, England, and at more than 50 galleries around the world.         Correction:  April 21, 1998, Tuesday  The obituary of the photographer Linda McCartney yesterday gave an incorrect name in some copies for the most recent studio album by her husband, the former Beatle Paul McCartney. It is ''Flaming Pie''; ''Off the Ground'' was the one before that.         Correction:  June 11, 1998, Thursday  The obituary of Linda McCartney on April 20 misstated her college background. She attended only the University of Arizona, not Sarah Lawrence College as well. The obituary also misstated the given name of her first husband in some copies. He was Melvin See, not Bob. The errors were pointed out in E-mail received from a reader yesterday.       
         Linda Schele, a onetime studio art teacher who made a fateful vacation visit to Mexico that turned her life upside down and helped revolutionize Mayan scholarship, died on Saturday at a hospital near her home in Austin, Tex. She was 55 and widely known for her pioneering work in decoding inscriptions on Mayan monuments.         Her husband, David, said the cause was pancreatic cancer.         A native of Nashville who obtained a bachelor's degree in education and a master's in fine arts from the University of Cincinnati in 1968, Dr. Schele (SHE-lee) was more or less contentedly teaching studio art at the University of South Alabama in Mobile when her husband, a Cincinnati-trained architect who had long been fascinated with pre-Columbian architecture, suggested that the couple spend their 1970 Christmas vacation visiting Mayan ruins in Mexico.         A woman of infectious enthusiasm, Dr. Schele, who had no special interest in the Mayan civilization, threw herself into the project, securing a grant to take photographs for the university collection and recruiting three art students for the trip.         As the travelers began their tour, they were persuaded to make a slight detour from their itinerary to spend a couple of hours visiting the ruins at the Mayan city of Palenque.         When they got there, Dr. Schele was so taken with the breathtaking beauty of the site and so enthralled by the scholars she encountered there that the 2-hour visit stretched to 12 days. By the time she got back to Mobile she had a new life's work.         She remained at South Alabama until she had obtained a doctorate in Latin American studies from the University of Texas and become a professor of art there in 1981, but Dr. Schele spent virtually every spare moment at Palenque and other Mayan sites.         Although the Mayans, who flourished from about A.D. 200 to 900, had long been recognized for their scientific work in devising a calendar based on advanced astronomical observations, they had been largely dismissed by scholars as sort of idiot savants, an illiterate nation of indolent stargazers who devoted all their considerable mathematical and intellectual resources simply to marking time. They were also seen as a blissfully peaceful people, whose fabled cities lacked even rudimentary fortifications.         As for the abundant carvings and glyphs on the countless monuments among the ruins, scholars had assumed these were variously religious symbols or arcane notations denoting the movement of planets.         The view had persisted even though a 16th century Spanish priest had done important though long-ignored work suggesting that the glyphs constituted an actual language and though a spate of recent work, derided by established scholars, had even worked out the syntax of the language, in which individual glyphs represented syllables of complex words.         It was at a meeting of scholars at Palenque in 1973 that Dr. Schele emerged as a leader of a revisionist school of Mayan scholarship. When it was suggested that she and a young Calgary University student at the meeting, Peter Matthews, try to translate the inscriptions on the monuments at Palenque, it took the pair only three hours to discover that the inscriptions provided an incredibly detailed history of the Palenque dynasty.         Over the next dozen years, Dr. Schele and others deciphered and interpreted inscriptions throughout the Mayan realm, but it was not until 1986, when Dr. Schele helped organize an exhibition at the Kimbell Art Museum in Fort Worth that the world learned the full implications of the work: Far from being an ethereal peaceful people, the Mayans were a warring nation who tortured and sometimes sacrificed their captives, whose nobles engaged in blood-letting rituals to placate their gods and whose king was required to stick a rod through the shaft of his own penis on ceremonial occasions.         A scholar who shared her own research generously and who organized annual conferences that became a focus of Mayan research, Dr. Schele collaborated on a series of important books, among them ''The Blood of Kings'' (1986, Braziller), ''A Forest of Kings'' (1990, Morrow), ''Maya Cosmos'' (1993, Morrow) and ''The Code of Kings'' (1998, Scribner.)         In recent years the woman who helped decipher a language and discover a history of a once mighty civilization had held workshops to teach the Mayan descendants how to read the language of their ancestors.         In addition to her husband, Dr. Schele is survived by a brother, Tom Richmond of Chicago.       
         Florence Skelly Altman, an innovator in opinion research, died on Tuesday at Scottsdale, Ariz., Memorial Hospital. She was 73 and lived in Scottsdale.         The cause of death was complications of heart disease, her daughter, Alexandra Altman, said.         Ms. Skelly, as she was known professionally, was instrumental in developing many techniques that are now standard in market research, including the use of simulated test markets to estimate the potential of new products. Today, variations of the method are used by major packaged goods marketing companies such as Procter & Gamble.         ''She had a great flair for the numbers side of the business, but saw the human implications of the numbers like no one I have ever known,'' said Daniel Yankelovich, a partner of Ms. Skelly at the opinion research firm that bore their names.         The social implications of Ms. Skelly's work were apparent in a study of younger Americans she and Mr. Yankelovich conducted in the late 1960's, among the first to call them baby boomers.         Arthur H. White, another partner and a professional colleague of Ms. Skelly for 50 years, said, ''The study revealed gender and race problems, that we had a society in which large segments of the population were not treated as well as other segments and that attitudes about institutions were changing.''         ''In those studies,'' he added, ''we saw that most people did not want to accept everything an employer or the Government said.''         Ms. Skelly had firsthand experience with sex discrimination early in her career. Mr. White recalled a meeting in the 1950's that he, Ms. Skelly and another male executive from Stewart Dougall, a New York research firm where she worked early on, were asked to attend with the board of the New York Stock Exchange. ''She had to sit outside in the hall while we, the two men, went in to talk,'' Mr. White said.         Suffering such indignities did little to dispel what her colleagues said was an admirable disposition.         ''She was a wonderful, witty person, very funny but serious at the same time, which is a great combination,'' Mr. Yankelovich said. ''Our clients loved her, and she loved the business.''         Ms. Skelly, a longtime resident of New York, moved to Scottsdale in the mid-1990's. She was a graduate of Hunter College, where her senior honors paper in social psychology, based on a public opinion survey of a Y.W.H.A. project in New York, exhibited her interest in market research.         She spent four years at Stewart Dougall, went to Washington for two years and worked on the 1950 Census, and then returned to the firm.         In 1961 she and Mr. White left to join Mr. Yankelovich. Later in the decade, the firm of Daniel Yankelovich Inc. was renamed Yankelovich, Skelly & White. In 1986, two years after the firm was bought by the  Saatchi & Saatchi Company, the advertising concern, Mr. Yankelovich, Ms. Skelly and Mr. White left to start another firm, citing policy disagreements.         Until her death Ms. Skelly served as vice chairwoman of the new firm, DYG Inc., based in Danbury, Conn. (Saatchi & Saatchi sold the former Yankelovich, Skelly & White, now Yankelovich Partners, in 1992.)         In recognition of her contributions to the field, in 1990 the Market Research Council inducted Ms. Skelly into its Market Research Hall of Fame.         Over the years Ms. Skelly served on numerous boards, including the National Council of Christians and Jews, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's Business Advisory Board and the Warnaco Corporation.         In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, Ms. Skelly is survived by her husband, Eugene Altman of Scottsdale, and a son, Jonathan Altman of Los Angeles.       
         Maria Torok, a psychoanalyst in France whose rejection of Freud's ideas was welcomed in feminist circles and whose new methods for confronting pain and trauma drew many Holocaust survivors to her offices in Paris, died on March 25 at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 72 and had lived briefly in Madison, Wis.         The cause was complications of leukemia, said Dr. Nicholas Rand, her husband and a professor of French literature at the University of Wisconsin.         Ms. Torok's work, much of it published with Nicolas Abraham, her main collaborator, rejected most of Freud's core ideas, said Dr. Nelly Furman, a professor of French at Cornell University. ''She focused on the uniqueness of individuals and how they can overcome psychic pain,'' Dr. Furman said.         Ms. Torok's vision of psychoanalysis was liberated from the Freudian framework, including the Oedipus complex -- in which a male child may see the father as a rival for the mother's love. That interpretation was useful to a wide range of patients who had experienced trauma, but especially to dozens of Jews who had survived the Holocaust.         ''Ms. Torok was a landmark figure, very important within the world of psychoanalysis,'' Dr. Furman said, ''remembered for the manner in which she brought back the importance of individual experience within the limits of the theoretical apparatus of psychoanalysis. She was concerned with the clinical and healing ends of psychoanalysis.''         Ms. Torok collaborated with Mr. Abraham from 1950 to 1975. Both were Hungarians in the line of psychoanalysis begun by their countryman, Sandor Ferenczi, who was a close associate of Freud.         Working in Paris from 1956 to 1996, Ms. Torok led a seminar in phenomenological psychology, which emphasized the person's experiences as the basis for analysis.         She employed a novel approach that ''pushed to the limits the explorations of the unconscious, with the goal of devising a clinical method for liberating people from the intergenerational 'phantoms' that haunt their memories and the buried 'crypts' that limit their freedom,'' said Dr. Rand, her English-language editor.         Collaborating with Mr. Abraham, she wrote ''The Shell and the Kernel: Renewals of Psychoanalysis'' (University of Chicago Press, 1994) and ''The Wolf Man's Magic Word'' (University of Minnesota Press, 1976), which explores a classic case in Freud's writings, a study of the delusions of a patient of Freud's known as the Wolf Man.         With Dr. Rand, Ms. Torok wrote and edited ''Questions for Freud: The Secret History of Psychoanalysis'' (Harvard University Press, 1998), and edited ''Rhythms: On the Work, Translation and Psychoanalysis'' (Stanford University Press, 1995).         Born in Budapest, Ms. Torok went to Paris in 1947 and received a bachelor's degree in psychology from the University of Paris in 1955. She received a certificate in 1959 from the Paris Psychoanalytic Society.         Aside from her husband, there were no other immediate survivors.       
         Marjory Stoneman Douglas, the spirited writer and environmentalist who was known as the patron saint of the Florida Everglades for her ceaseless campaign to preserve the fragile wetlands, died yesterday at her home in Miami. She was 108.         Mrs. Douglas, who prevailed in recent years over blindness, hearing difficulties and other ailments, died in the English-style cottage she had built on a leafy street in Miami's Coconut Grove neighborhood in 1926.         ''The years caught up with her,'' William T. Muir, a lawyer and friend, told The Associated Press. He said that after cremation, her remains would be scattered over a portion of  Everglades National Park that bears her name.         The author of many short stories, novels and works of nonfiction, Mrs. Douglas was best known for her 1947 call to arms, ''The Everglades: River of Grass,'' which was at once a natural and political history and a  warning of what was to come if developers and other commercial interests were permitted to have their way with the unique wetlands that cover much of southern Florida.         The book became a best-seller and transformed public perception of the wetlands, which were then considered by most people to be useless swamps that should be drained and developed for farming and housing.  The novelist John Hersey, reviewing the book for The New York Herald Tribune, called it ''a remarkable almost poem'' and said that in the years to come, it would remain ''unique in any company.''         Mrs. Douglas began her book simply: ''There are no other Everglades in the world.''         ''The simplicity, the diversity, the related harmony of the forms of life they enclose. . . . It is a river of grass,'' she wrote.         Her phrase ''river of grass'' caught the public imagination but it was also a reference to the fact that the Everglades is really a vast, slow-moving stream of shallow water and saw grass that covers much of the final 100 miles of South Florida.         Mrs. Douglas was considered an authority on the delicate ecosystem of the Everglades, which is home to ibises, roseate spoonbills, wood storks, manatees, the threatened Florida panther and saltwater crocodile, and hundreds of other animals, fish and plants. But in her book she made her case with a rare blend of science, local lore and history, and shimmering writing: ''The clear burning light of the sun pours daylong into the saw grass and is lost there, soaked up, never given back. Only the water flashes and glints. The grass yields nothing.''         In 1947, the year her book was published, she also helped lead the campaign to have the central core of the Everglades preserved as Everglades National Park.         Long before water problems began to plague South Florida, Mrs. Douglas cried out against poor land management and the ill-planned creation of canals that, in effect, decreased the amount of fresh water in the Everglades and increased the amount of salt water, imperiling the ecosystem.         She deplored state and local policies that encouraged overdevelopment of the Everglades and threatened the very source water on which South Florida depends. Of the people of South Florida, she said, ''They could not get it through their heads that they had produced some of the worst conditions themselves, by their lack of cooperation, their selfishness, their mutual distrust and their willful refusal to consider the truth of the whole situation.''         She added that unless people acted more responsibly, ''overdrainage will go on'' and ''the soil will shrink and burn and be wasted and destroyed, in a continuing ruin.''         But in ''The Everglades: River of Grass,'' she expressed the hope that ''perhaps even in this last hour, in a new relation of usefulness and beauty, the vast, magnificent, subtle and unique region of the Everglades may not be utterly lost.''         In 1969, she helped found Friends of the Everglades, a conservation organization that now has 5,000 members. Joe Podgor, the former executive director, called her ''the giant on whose shoulders we all stand.''         In 1990, on her 100th birthday, when she was blind and frail, she continued to speak out against those who plundered the Everglades. And as damaged as the Everglades were, the fact that any of it remained was in large measure a tribute to her perseverance.         Roderick J. Jude, a longtime leader of the Florida chapter of the Sierra Club, said, ''The Everglades wouldn't be there for us to try to continue to save if not for her work through the years.''         Once an area of more than 4,000 square miles, the Everglades has shrunk to less than half its original size, the result of overdrainage, urban sprawl and pollution from government-supported sugar cane and dairy farming. Many think its long-range future is still tenuous.         In 1996, President Clinton endorsed a project to protect the Everglades by spending several hundred million dollars to buy farmland, take it out of production and try to restore the kind of natural water flow that Mrs. Douglas warned the state it was in danger of losing.         The proposal was strongly opposed by farmers, who saw it as an erosion of agribusiness. The sugar farmers asserted it was not their activities that damaged the Everglades as much as government drainage and flood control projects that turned wetlands into dry land so that it could be used for urban development.         In 1996, the voters of Florida approved a constitutional amendment for the cleanup of the Everglades,  but rejected a penny-a-pound tax on sugar to pay for it. The sugar growers convinced a majority of voters that the tax would have cost thousands of jobs.         The following year the Clinton Administration and the State of Florida agreed to buy more than 50,000 acres of sugar cane fields on the outskirts of Everglades National Park, a step toward rescuing the endangered ecosystem from polluted runoff.         A comprehensive restoration plan for the Everglades is expected later this year from the Army Corps of Engineers, which together with the South Florida Water Management District, a state agency, has been directed by Congress to oversee the huge replumbing project designed to restore the flow of fresh, clean water on which the Everglades depends.         Marjory Stoneman was born April 7, 1890, in Minneapolis, the daughter of Frank and Lillian Stoneman. Her father was a judge who became the first editor of the paper that eventually became The Miami Herald; her mother was a concert violinist.         Mrs. Douglas was raised in Taunton, Mass., and went to Wellesley College, where she majored in English, graduating in the class of 1912. Two years later she married a newspaperman named Kenneth Douglas, but realizing her marriage was a mistake she went to Miami, where she became a reporter at her father's newspaper. During World War I, she served with the American Red Cross in France, Belgium, Italy and in the Balkans.         Back in Miami after the war, she obtained a divorce and was reunited with her father at The Herald, becoming assistant editor, writing editorials and editing a literary column called ''The Galley.'' Her editorial writing presaged ''The Everglades: River of Grass,'' in that she began to explore the problems associated with Florida's rapid commercial development.         In 1923 she left The Herald to try free-lancing and sold her first story to The Saturday Evening Post. In 1928 she won second place in the O. Henry Memorial Prize for short story writing. In 1937, another of her short stories, ''Story of a Homely Woman,'' was included in a selection of the best Post stories published that year. Her first novel, ''Road to the Sun,'' which she worked on for 10 years, was published in 1951. It was the first of several works she would create for young readers.         Among Mrs. Douglas's other works were ''The Key to Paris,'' a book for young readers published in 1961, and a play, ''The Gallows Gate,'' in 1928. With John Rothchild she wrote ''Voice of the River,'' in 1987, an autobiography that told of her fierce advocacy of conservation measures to save the natural environment of South Florida.         Her short stories appeared in many magazines, including The Saturday Evening Post, Collier's and Women's Home Companion.         In addition to her writing, Mrs. Douglas taught at the University of Miami from 1925 to 1929 and also lectured at Pennsylvania State University in the late 1920's. She served on the editorial board of the University of Miami Press and for a time wrote book reviews. Among her other interests was the Junior Museum of Miami and the Coconut Grove Slum Clearance Association. She was also a member of the Society of Women Geographers.         Mrs. Douglas, who had no immediate survivors, was honored in many ways. Queen Elizabeth visited her in 1991. Two years later, President Clinton awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The building in Tallahassee that houses the state Department of Environmental Protection is named for her. Also named for her are a nature center in Key Biscayne and several schools and parks elsewhere in Florida.         President Clinton said of Mrs. Douglas in a statement from Germany, ''Long before there was an Earth Day, Mrs. Douglas was a passionate steward of our nation's natural resources, and particularly her Florida Everglades.''         On her 100th birthday, Marjory Stoneman Douglas was asked if she had hope for the Everglades' survival. She answered: ''I am neither an optimist nor a pessimist. I say it's got to be done.''       
         Belle Zeller, an emeritus professor of political science at Brooklyn College and a scholar of the legislative process who was an indomitable leader of unions representing City University of New York professors for more than 30 years, died on Friday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 95.         Dr. Zeller, who at 83 survived an accident in which she was struck by a bus and critically injured, died in her sleep, said her niece, Laura Glass.         From 1944 until 1972, Dr. Zeller was the chairwoman of the Legislative Conference of the City Colleges, a lobbying group that later became the first union to represent the permanent faculty in the City University system. In 1972, the conference merged with the United Federation of College Teachers, a rival union representing part-time instructors. For the next four years, Dr. Zeller was president of the joint group, the Professional Staff Congress.         As a labor advocate for the professors, Dr. Zeller lobbied for legislation to establish tenure and pensions that today are considered some of the basic rights of public college teachers in New York State. She used her academic expertise in the legislative process to champion the rights of faculty members, becoming a familiar figure at City Hall and the State Capitol.         ''When it came to representing the faculty, she was irrepressible,'' said Irwin H. Polishook, who has been president of Professional Staff Congress since Dr. Zeller retired in 1976. ''She would burst in on legislators who were busy with other business, even if they were behind closed doors, even if they were in conference. Because of who she was, people accepted that. She was able to get people's attention because she was a scholar as well as an activist.''         Belle Zeller was born in New York City on April 8, 1903. She was one of nine children of a couple who had emigrated from Eastern Europe to New York, where her father worked in a shoe factory. Her parents and older siblings often discussed politics around the dinner table and she became fascinated by government at an early age.         She attended Hunter College High School and Hunter College, where she specialized in history and the social sciences, earning a B.A. in 1924 and an M.A. in 1926. She was one of the system's few female professors when she began teaching at Hunter College's Brooklyn campus in 1927. She remained there when it changed its name to Brooklyn College in 1930, becoming one of the institution's founding instructors.         In 1937, she received a Ph.D. in political science from Columbia University.         Her doctoral dissertation, ''Pressure Politics in New York'' (Prentice Hall, 1937) was one of the first major studies of lobbying in New York State politics and it was reprinted in 1967. She was later recognized nationwide as an authority on lobbying and served as an adviser to Senator John F. Kennedy and other legislators who were revising the Federal Lobbying Registration Act.         Throughout her long career, Dr. Zeller was the recipient of numerous academic awards, including an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the Graduate School of City University in 1985 and the President's Medal from Brooklyn College on the institution's 50th anniversary in 1980.         Dr. Zeller never married. In addition to Ms. Glass, she is survived by four other nieces and a nephew.       
         Mary Bancroft Boulton, a psychotherapist who helped introduce to New York City the practice of transactional analysis, which tries to help a patient correct self-destructive behavior patterns in relationships with other people, died at her home in Greenwich Village on May 30. She was 86.         Transactional analysis became popular after Dr. Eric Berne published ''Games People Play'' in 1964 (reissued in paperback by Ballantine Books in 1996). Dr. Boulton studied with Dr. Berne in San Francisco, then brought the new therapy to New York in 1966 when she founded the New York Transactional Analysis Seminar with Dr. Marian Weisberg and Dr. Barbara Rosenfeld.         Transactional analysis, often done in group therapy, delves into the multiple roles each person plays, as a child or parent, for example. One of Dr. Boulton's sons, John Bancroft, said, ''She would often say to me, 'Well, that's your child speaking,' or, 'That's your parent speaking.' ''         Dr. Boulton was also concerned with the roles thrust upon her patients, particularly women, by society.         In one article, she said patients not only needed to escape from the smothering influence of demanding parents but also needed to defy ''the 'big guns' of our culture -- traditional religious teaching, educational practice, literature, television, and the toys and games which are prescribed for boys and girls.''         The New York seminar, modeled after one run by Dr. Berne, was open to any psychotherapists who wanted to learn the new therapy, Dr. Weisberg said.         The seminar met until 1973, when Dr. Boulton and Dr. Weisberg opened the Gotham Institute for Transactional Analysis, a training institute that closed in 1978. Dr. Boulton continued her private practice until she retired in 1990.         Dr. Boulton was born Mary Elizabeth Holzman in Cincinnati on Aug. 9, 1911. She received a bachelor's degree in education from the University of Cincinnati in 1932 and a master's in social work from the University of Pennsylvania in 1935. She received her Ph.D. in 1980 from Northern Indiana University.         She married Frank Bancroft in 1935, and they were both active in left-wing causes.         Mr. Bancroft died in 1959. Dr. Boulton married John Wallace in 1962; the marriage ended in divorce.         Dr. Boulton married Schroeder Boulton in 1965, and their home in Greenwich Village became a gathering spot for people in civil rights and antiwar work, Mr. Bancroft said.         Dr. Boulton is survived by her husband; three sons, Carter Bancroft, of Huntington, N.Y., and Michael and John Bancroft, both of Seattle; three stepdaughters, Janet Boulton, of New York, Nancy Boulton, of Lincoln, Mass., and Tiffany Wallace, of Lexington, Ky., and seven grandchildren.       
         Maxine S. Pfeffer, an assistant United States attorney in Manhattan whose prosecutions ranged from drug dealing to international art theft, died on Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center after a long battle with cancer. She was 37.         Ms. Pfeffer's achievements included her prosecution of 29 organized-crime figures in a major drug-trafficking case in 1994 and helping run a sensitive Justice Department investigation into allegations that high officials of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service had deliberately misled Congress about overcrowding and security problems in the agency's Florida operations.         She had recently begun to specialize in art law. In one case last year that drew international attention, she prosecuted three people accused in the theft and attempted sale of more than $10 million worth of valuable drawings, including works by Rembrandt and Albrecht Durer.         The drawings had come from a cache of artworks that was originally part of a collection looted from the Bremen Museum in Germany at the end of World War II.         Bonnie Goldblatt, a United States Customs agent who worked on the case, said that Ms. Pfeffer -- whose friends called her Max -- loved art, and that they would visit museums together in what little spare time they had.         ''She kept her plate full of art cases,'' Agent Goldblatt said.         Ms. Pfeffer grew up in Brooklyn and attended Harvard, where she was an editor at The Crimson. After graduation in 1981 she worked for a year as a paralegal for Linda A. Fairstein, chief of the Sex Crimes Prosecution Unit in the Manhattan District Attorney's office, before entering Harvard Law School.         After graduating cum laude from there in 1985, Ms. Pfeffer worked for three years as an associate in the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. She specialized in commercial litigation, but also took on extensive pro bono work in capital punishment cases. She went to the United States Attorney's office for the Southern District in 1991 and later worked closely there with Mary Jo White, the chief Federal prosecutor.         Ms. Pfeffer is survived by her husband, Khalid Chahi of Manhattan, a son, Sami, and her mother, Shirley Pfeffer of Brooklyn.       
         Catherine Kennedy, who after a  long struggle established one of the nation's first nursing centers for AIDS patients, died on Tuesday at her home in New Haven. She was 51.         The cause of death was pancreatic cancer, family members said.         Not long after moving to New Haven with her family in 1983, Mrs. Kennedy became aware of the lack of nursing centers and services for people with AIDS. Many were turned away by nursing homes. Some were being kept, at enormous expense, at hospitals essentially unequipped to treat them. Others were homeless.         She resolved to open a nursing center for AIDS patients but constantly encountered obstacles. She waged an eight-year struggle against  financial and political obstacles to establish the home. Her experiences, which became a case study for the Harvard Business School, exemplified how someone involved in social entrepreneurship could overcome  great odds.         After two years of research and attempts to raise money, she received a $60,000 grant from the Merck Family Fund. When she sought help from the State Legislature, she encountered indifference and fear of AIDS among the public, as well as hostility from legislators more interested in cutting health-care funds than increasing them.         But she gained the help of Lucie McKinney, the widow of Representative Stewart McKinney, who had died of AIDS, to plead her case with Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.         The Governor was persuaded and,  with others, gained passage of a bill to provide special funding for her project that included daily patient costs that were substantially less than full hospitalization and $3 million to renovate an old factory in New Haven.         In 1995, the home opened in the reconverted factory as Leeway Inc.; Mrs. Kennedy ran it until last fall,  when she was forced to resign because of her illness. In that time about 150 patients have been treated.         Catherine Urwin Kennedy was born on Feb. 12, 1947 in Wallsend, England. She received a bachelor of arts in economics and a master's in economic history from the University of East Anglia in England, where she later taught. She also earned a master's degree at Yale's school of management.         She married Paul Kennedy, the author and Yale historian, in 1967.  Besides her husband, she is survived by three sons, James and Matthew, of New Haven, and John, of New York, and two brothers and two sisters, all of England.         It was through her affiliation with  Yale that she was able to apply for her patients' participation in the university's experimental research in  AIDS medication and treatment.         Mrs. Kennedy's original goal was to build a home to shelter and care for dying patients. But today, Leeway staff members said, nearly half  of the patients can be sent home with reasonable chances of survival.  Among them was Fred Tyson, who is going back to work as a casting director in Hollywood.         ''She got us involved,'' he said of Catherine Kennedy. ''And I truly believe I would not be alive if it weren't for her.''       
         Galina Brezhnev, the high-living daughter of the former Soviet leader Leonid I. Brezhnev whose antics often led to scandal, died today in a Moscow hospital. She was 69.         Russian news agencies said she is to be cremated on Wednesday. There were no details about the cause of death.         Galina Brezhnev was never involved in politics but she figured in some major scandals in the last years of Soviet power. The arrests of some of her husbands and some of her friends illuminated corruption of the Soviet aristocracy.         A hard-drinking member of the Soviet elite who liked to race her father's Mercedes, Ms. Brezhnev had her first brush with scandal when she was just 22 and ran away with a circus acrobat.         ''He could hold 10 people on his shoulders but failed to hold Galina too long,'' NTV television observed tonight. ''Galina got married quite often.'' She remained infatuated with the circus and with circus performers for several decades.         In 1982 a close friend from the circus, known as Boris the Gypsy, was arrested and charged with smuggling. The arrest took place when Yuri V. Andropov was head of the K.G.B., and Mr. Andropov portrayed the move as part of his anticorruption drive. But it was also interpreted as a bid by Mr. Andropov to position himself to succeed Mr. Brezhnev as Soviet leader. Mr. Brezhnev died in 1982.         That was not the end of her notoriety: In 1988 her husand Yuri Churbanov was arrested for taking bribes and imprisoned for six years. Mr. Churbanov had been a lieutenant colonial in the police when he met Ms. Breznev and was promoted to post of Chief Deputy Interior Minister soon after their marriage.         Coming in the early years of reform under Mikhail S. Gorbachev, the Churbanov case sent an important political signal: that no one was above the law.         After Mr. Churbanov was jailed, Ms. Brezhnev said she was unaware of his bribe-taking and divorced him, saying he had been a bad husband. Mr. Churbanov was released from prison in 1993.         Despite her brushes with scandal, Ms. Brezhnev retained her privileges and comfortable life style. She  won a law suit for the return of a Mercedes and other valuables confiscated from Mr. Churbanov.         There were no details tonight about survivors.       
         Elaine Aiken, a Method acting teacher, former member of the Actors Studio and a founder and director of Actors Conservatory in Manhattan, died on July 12 at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 71.         The cause was cancer, said Lily Lodge, the other founder and director of Actors Conservatory.         A teacher who worked with such actors as Harvey Keitel, Alec Baldwin, Shelley Winters and Brooke Shields, Ms. Aiken was known for her ability to allay a student's fears with her relaxation techniques. While she could be a strict taskmaster, she could get an actor to slow down, control his breathing and find the confidence to convey his own vulnerability onstage.         Ms. Aiken was born Elena Arizmendi in Cordoba, Spain, and came to New York with her parents during the Spanish Civil War. She began studying with Lee Strasberg in 1951 and joined the Actors Studio three years later, exercising considerable influence as a member of its auditions panel as well as through her directing abilities.         She was a Strasberg protegee, said Ms. Lodge, who added that Strasberg counted her among the few people he considered able to carry on his work as a teacher.         From 1977 to 1984 she taught acting at the Lee Strasberg Theater Institute, and she founded Actors Conservatory with Ms. Lodge in 1987. She acted on television, onstage and in films, including a 1957 western, ''The Lonely Man,'' with Anthony Perkins and Jack Palance.         She also appeared in the movie ''Caddyshack'' (1980) and had parts onstage in a 1975 revival of ''Death of a Salesman'' directed by George C. Scott and in ''Cages'' (1963) by Lewis John Carlino.         She is survived by a son, Robert Aiken of Washington; a sister, Carmen Zincke of Madrid; a brother, Henry Arizmendi of Tenafly, N.J., and three granddaughters.       
         Geraldine Owen Delaney, a nutritionist who founded a highly regarded New Jersey treatment center for people recovering from alcohol and drug addictions, as she had, died on July 9 at Newton Memorial Hospital in Newton, N.J. She was 91 and lived in Frelinghuysen Township.         In 1957, she founded the Little Hill Foundation, which operates a private adult residential center in Blairstown, N.J., called Little Hill-Alina Lodge. She was known for her approach to the long-term treatment of people who resisted such help. She was chief executive of the foundation until she retired in 1994.         She was named to the New Jersey State Advisory Council on Alcohol Problems in 1975, and in the 1980's she served on the advisory board of the United States Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental Health Administration.         When she retired, Mrs. D, as she was known, was able to celebrate 50 years of sobriety and service. Her early fall into dependency and her wrenching recovery played a pivotal role in her career, as did her friendship with two co-founders of Alcoholics Anonymous and Al-Anon, a support group for relatives and close friends of alcoholics.         The two co-founders, Bill and Lois Wilson, New Yorkers, took her through A.A.'s 12 steps, enabling her to face up to her alcoholism and take the organization's message to others. From this experience she derived her own no-nonsense program and opened the Blairstown center in Warren County, one of the first such treatment centers in the country.         She was convinced that the families of alcoholics needed educating in order to support the recovery process. Her comprehensive treatment for adults she described as ''reluctant to recover'' includes total abstinence, strict rules, an atmosphere of tough love -- a regimen of three to eight months, sometimes longer.         Her work was praised by Betty Ford, co-founder of the Betty Ford Center. The former First Lady called Mrs. Delaney ''a front-runner in the field of alcohol and drug treatment'' who had helped thousands of professional people.         Her work was the subject of a recent paperback titled ''Hope! The Story of Geraldine D., Alina Lodge & and Recovery'' (Tincture of Time Press, Hawaii), which was written by a historian of Alcoholics Anonymous, Dick B.         A native of Stonington, Ill., she was educated at Knox College and the University of Illinois.         In 1949, she married Thomas Francis Delaney, a building contractor, who helped her start the Little Hill Foundation and Alina Lodge. Mr. Delaney died some years ago. She is survived by a niece, Margaret Owen Fisher, of Plymouth, Mich., and a nephew, James Owen, of Atlanta.       
         Judith F. Albert, a toy designer whose credits include the redesign of the Cabbage Patch doll for the mass market as well as other commercially successful dolls, died July 20 from breast cancer at her home in Mill Neck, N.Y. She was 59 years old.         Her vinyl recast of the formerly all-cloth Cabbage Patch doll in the early 1980's for the toy company Coleco Industries set off a frenzy among parents to obtain the dolls for their children or, perhaps, for themselves. Mrs. Albert had devised a way to manufacture the dolls with variety in eye color, facial features and clothes, so that each one looked unique. Like the originals, they also came with birth certificates, suggesting additional reality.         ''People were beating each other up in the store aisles, trying to get one,'' recalled Christopher Byrne, editor of Playthings Market Watch, a toy-industry newsletter. ''There were stories about people flying to Europe to buy them.''         Mrs. Albert, a native of Rockville Centre, N.Y., graduated from the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan and joined the Ideal Toy Company, then based in Queens, in 1960. She remained there for more than 20 years, said her husband, Arthur, whom she met when he joined the company in 1963.         Together -- she was the designer, he was the marketer -- they worked on a series of dolls, including Betsy-Wetsy, Tiny Tears, Tiffany Taylor and Chrissie, a doll heralded in television commercials for her ''beautiful hair that grows, and grows, right down to her toes.''         Chrissie, Mr. Albert said, was inspired by a television show he and his wife were watching one night about Rapunzel. ''The hair gave us the idea,'' he said. Chrissie, whose hair could be rewound with a knob attached to her torso, inspired a line of other dolls, including Velvet, who had purple eyes, Mr. Albert said.         By 1981, the couple had left Ideal because they did not want to follow the company when it relocated to New Jersey. They established their own company, called Alberts Design, and continued working on dolls and other toys. Among their successful projects was the Puffalumps series of dolls made by Fisher-Price Inc. -- now part of Mattel Inc. -- one of the first toys to be made of the synthetic fabric used in parachutes, and, more recently, the company came out with Singing Bouncy Baby, which sings when bounced on a child's knee, and Happy Hugs, which has a ''hug-o-meter'' that measures how hard a child squeezes it.         Thin, exuberant and always meticulously dressed, Mrs. Albert was a fixture at the annual Toy Fair in Manhattan for many years, where she now and then dressed in clothes matching whatever Tiffany Taylor, a Barbie-type doll made by Ideal, was wearing that season. In her spare time, she painted, sketched, raised prize-winning dahlias and tended a poolful of ornamental goldfish called koi on the grounds of the house she and her husband designed and built together in 1976.         Her instinct for what would make a doll appeal to children appeared to be innate. Not only would she design a doll, but she would also design the showroom for the manufacturer, said Maurene Souza, a former executive at Hasbro Inc. who worked with Mrs. Albert over the years.         ''She always understood the connection the child makes with the toy,'' Mr. Byrne said. ''Toys that have long-term value really aren't complete without the child.''         In addition to her husband, of Mill Neck, Mrs. Albert is survived by her mother, Florence Carman of Franklin Square, N.Y.; a stepson, Ross M. Albert of East Norwich, N.Y.; a stepdaughter, Ronda Kornfeld of Greensboro, N.C., and four stepgrandchildren.       
         Dorothy West, ''the Kid'' of the  Harlem Renaissance circle of writers and artists in the 1920's who was rediscovered seven decades later when her novel ''The Wedding'' was published and became a best-seller,  died on Sunday night at New England Medical Center in Boston. She was 91 and a longtime resident of Oak Bluffs, Martha's Vineyard.         Miss West, who began writing stories at age 7 in her family's elegant four-story house in Boston, was not yet 20 in 1926 when her short  story ''The Typewriter'' won a prize from the Urban League's Opportunity magazine. Encouraged, she  moved to Harlem and joined the poets, novelists, musicians and other artists forging a cultural renaissance there. Long before her death, she was frequently described as the last surviving member of that group.         ''We thought we were going to be the greatest writers in the world,'' she told The Los Angeles Times in 1995. 'We were all young and we fell in love with each other. We all had the same ambitions: writers and painters and so forth. We were free. . . .We had an innocence that nobody can have now.''         Langston Hughes gave Miss West the nickname ''the Kid'' and took her to Russia in 1932. She asked him to marry her but he declined. Soon she received a proposal from Countee Cullen, the poet who received one of the first Guggenheim Fellowships given to an African-American. She turned him down. She shared an apartment with Zora Neale Hurston, the writer and folklorist, and when guests came to the loft of Wallace Thurman, the novelist and editor, she was always there, sitting on the floor.  She had a bit part in the original stage production of ''Porgy and Bess.'' Claude McKay, already established as a poet and novelist, scolded her for not writing more.         ''We were a beautiful, young group,'' she told a Boston Globe interviewer in 1989. 'We drank too much, though. We drank too much.''         Miss West's first novel, ''The Living Is Easy,'' was not published until  1948, when the Harlem Renaissance had long faded. Her second, ''The  Wedding,'' about the aspirations and anxieties of black people living on Martha's Vineyard, appeared in 1995. Both were written at her family's former vacation home on the  Vineyard, where she had lived year-round since 1947 and was a columnist for The Vineyard Gazette.         At her celebrity-studded 90th birthday party on the island in 1997, which drew hundreds of well-wishers, she was called ''a national treasure'' by Hillary Rodham Clinton.         Miss West's stories and novels used brisk narratives, an eye for detail and wit to explore the aspirations of well-to-do blacks and the interplay of race, class and intraracial tensions in America. Her work was not overtly political, tending to more lyrical depictions of vanity, longing, love and misunderstanding.         ''Color is important, but class is more important,'' Miss West often said in the dozens of interviews she gave after ''The Wedding'' was published by Doubleday and made into a  miniseries by Oprah Winfrey.         Critics praised her storytelling and her pioneering descriptions of  conflict within the black middle class. ''There is an abundance of  psychological and historic richness to her characters,'' Elizabeth Benedict wrote in The Washington Post in 1995, ''and she can be wickedly eloquent about the costs of living in a world where the shadings in the color of one's skin are more important than the bonds between blood relatives.''         Miss West was born on June 2, 1907, in Boston, the only child of Isaac and Rachel West. Her father, born a slave, built a fruit and vegetable business that lifted the family into the slim ranks of Boston's black upper middle class. Her mother, a generation younger, ''spirited, fearless, sassy and smart,'' brought many of her 18 siblings and their families to live with them.         Family members ''ranged in color from the blond child to me,'' Miss  West wrote in ''The Richer, the Poorer,'' a collection of short stories and essays published in 1995. ''We were always stared at. . . . My mother prepared us. As she marched us down our front stairs, she would say what our smiles were on tiptoe to hear, 'Come on, children, let's go out and  drive the white folks crazy.'         ''She said it without rancor, and she said it in that outrageous way to  make us laugh. She was easing our entry into a world that outranked us  and outnumbered us. If she could not help us see ourselves with the humor,  however wry, that gives the heart its grace, she would never have forgiven  herself for letting our spirits be crushed before we had learned to  sheathe them with pride.''         The sisters and cousins defended  each other against outsiders, but at home squabbles were melodramatic, Miss West said. ''Surrounded by all these different personalities, each one wanting to be first among equals, I knew I wanted to be a writer.  Living with them was like living inside a story.''         Her work was first published when she was 14, in The Boston Post, and she soon became a regular contributor. After graduating from the Girls' Latin School at 16, she attended Boston University and the Columbia University School of Journalism.         In 1932, she and 20 other black Americans including Langston Hughes, were invited to visit the Soviet Union to work on a proposed movie about racism in America. The film was never made, but Miss West remained in the Soviet Union with Hughes for a year, returning to the United States only when she learned of her father's death.         There remains some question about whether she and Hughes were romantically involved, although she proposed to him in a letter in 1933. In a 1995 interview with The Boston Globe, she said that she never particularly wanted to marry -- ''Seemed like the man just became the woman's child'' -- but had wanted a child.  The memory of how she learned she could not was still painful decades later: the white doctor telling her briskly, ''There are already enough black people in the world.''         Miss West had no immediate survivors, although she remained close to many of her cousins.         In 1934, she founded Challenge, a quarterly magazine intended as a showcase for younger black writers and ''to recapture in the mid-30's the literary vitality of the Harlem Renaissance, which had not survived the Depression.'' Her subsequent magazine, New Challenge -- which reflected the belief of its associate editor, Richard Wright, that art is a weapon -- survived only briefly in 1937.         Miss West became a welfare investigator in Harlem (a job that was the source for several short stories)  and joined the Depression-era Federal Writers Project. In 1940, she began contributing two short stories a month at $50 apiece to The New York Daily News, an association she continued until 1960.         In the summer of 1947, she left New York for good, moving to Martha's Vineyard and the two-bedroom cedar-shingled cottage in Oak Bluffs that her father had bought. She lived there the rest of her life, once writing: ''I have lived in various places, but the island is my yearning place.  All my life, wherever I have been, abroad, New York, Boston, anywhere, whenever I yearned for home, I yearned for the island.''         ''The Living Is Easy'' was published the next year. In this semiautobiographical tale, the strong-willed, light-skinned Cleo Judson -- modeled on Miss West's mother -- tries to remake her darker-skinned  daughter, and breaks up her own  marriage to a former slave who had made himself ''the Black Banana King.'' The book satirizes upper-crust black Bostonians.         In the late 1940's, Miss West began writing columns for The Vineyard Gazette.. While caring for ailing relatives in the now-winterized cottage, she was also slowly writing another novel, published as ''The Wedding'' in 1995. (''The Richer, The Poorer,''  gathering 13 essays and 17 stories Miss West wrote between 1926 and 1987, came out later the same year.)         Starting in 1992, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, then a book editor for Doubleday, had visited the cottage once a week in the summers to work on the long-stalled novel with Miss  West. Mrs. Onassis died shortly before its publication, and Miss West dedicated it to her memory, writing,  ''Though there was never such a mismatched pair in appearance, we were perfect partners.''         Set in the black community on Martha's Vineyard during the 1950's, the novel is a gently ironic story of a beautiful, blond, privileged young black woman, Shelby Coles, who is torn about her planned marriage to a white jazz musician. Using flashbacks from the wedding day to many past generations, it delves into interracial and intraracial bigotry. Miss  West's belief in integration and her penchant for romance coalesced in the final line she gave Shelby Coles: ''Color was a false distinction; love  was not.''         Oprah Winfrey used the novel for a two-part miniseries this year. ''It shows a world that most people have rarely seen, a world where black  families are all highly educated, very successful, living in Martha's  Vineyard,'' Miss Winfrey said.         An energetic conversationalist and inveterate storyteller who was less than five feet tall, Miss West kept her distance from the political upheavals of her lifetime. She went to Communist Russia with Hughes and the others, she wrote in ''The Richer, the Poorer,'' because ''I liked them.'' In the 1960's and 70's, Miss West was not active in the civil rights movement and found radicals like the Black Panthers discomfiting.         ''I'm a creative writer,'' she said late in life. ''I'm not a black with a  chip on my shoulder.'' Instead, she often said: ''Color is nothing when you know people.''       
         Sister Irene Kraus, a onetime schoolteacher with such a high-spirited talent for leadership and such hard-nosed business ability that she went on to run a series of hospitals and spend six years as the founding chief executive of the $3 billion Daughters of Charity National Health System, died Aug. 20 at a hospital in Baltimore. She was 74 and lived in Emmitsburg, Md., where she was administrator of her order's provincial headquarters.         Friends said the cause was cancer.         While it is tempting to speculate on what direction her life might have taken if she had not joined the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent de Paul, in an era when women's horizons were bounded largely by home and family, it would be hard to find a secular career path that would have allowed her to become president of the nation's largest nonprofit hospital chain.         But then for Sister Irene, who grew up in Philadelphia, the religious life seems to have been a foregone family conclusion. Like her business acumen and her boundless good humor, her religious commitment seems to have come from her father, Frank, a Pennsylvania Railroad executive with a weakness for practical jokes and such a spiritual bent, his daughter later recalled, that ''he would pray all the way to work, and when I went with him, I would pray, too.''         A standout student at the Daughters of Charity's Elizabeth Seton High School in Baltimore, Sister Irene graduated at 17 in 1941 and immediately joined the religious order.         After a year of novitiate training, she spent seven years teaching elementary and high school students in Richmond. Then her superiors decided it was time for her to get a college education and asked her to switch to a medical career.         After earning a nursing degree at the Catholic University of America in Washington in 1952, she quickly became an operating room supervisor, performing her duties at a series of hospitals with such efficiency and flair that three years later she was made administrator of Our Lady of Lourdes Memorial Hospital in Binghamton, N.Y., the first of several hospitals nationwide she ran for the order.         When the five autonomous American provinces of the Daughters of Charity decided to consolidate their hospital systems in 1986, Sister Irene was the obvious choice to put the merger into effect and run the operation, which included three dozen hospitals and 19 other operations in 17 states with a combined annual budget of more than $3 billion.         And over the next six years, during a period of mounting fiscal and other pressures, she proved more than equal to the task of meshing often incompatible accounting and other systems into an efficient operation with common purchasing and other functions.         In addition to its embrace of women's potential, the religious order gave Sister Irene other advantages. In a business world where women have had to pick their way through contradictory advice on how to dress for success, Sister Irene never had a wardrobe worry. Whether conducting a board meeting or entertaining at a reception, she wore a version of the same understated habit, a simple blue dress, she had worn as an elementary school teacher.         If the men she encountered were unaccustomed to dealing with a hard-driving business woman in a habit, Sister Irene, a raconteur with an impish sense of humor, knew how to put them at ease and rarely stopped there. At stodgy gatherings, Sister Irene, a tall, imposing woman with a commanding laugh, would sometimes break into an impromptu dance. And when she got up from her seat at a formal dinner to ''work the room,'' Sister Irene would be easy to track: She inevitably left a trail of laughter in her wake.         During a career in which she served on more than 70 national boards and committees, Sister Irene became accustomed to being the only woman in the room. And in 1980, when she became the first woman to serve as chairman of the American Hospital Association, she headed off a move to call her chairwoman or chairperson. She told the board, ''I didn't work this hard to get here and have my title changed.''         For all her accomplishments as president of the national system, Sister Irene, who later ran a hospital in Pensacola, Fla., and was still vice chairman of the merged Baptist St. Vincent's Hospital system in Jacksonville, Fla., at the time of her death, said her proudest achievement was developing a five-point value system for the national chain. The first four, including treating people with respect and serving the impoverished, sounded like familiar religious principles. The fifth, ''Be Creative to Infinity,'' sounded exactly like Sister Irene.         Sister Irene is survived by three sisters, Gertrude Hunter and Maguerite Williams of Bel Air, Md., and Dolores Freeman of Willards, Md.       
         Dorothy Carnegie Rivkin, an author and instructor who developed the Dale Carnegie Training company into a worldwide operation, died on Thursday after a long illness. She was 85 and lived in Forest Hills Gardens, Queens.         Mrs. Carnegie Rivkin, a native of Tulsa, Okla., was chairwoman of Dale Carnegie Training. In the 1940's and 50's she was married to the founder of the company, Dale Carnegie, who wrote the classic American self-help book ''How to Win Friends and Influence People.'' Mrs. Carnegie took control of company operations after Mr. Carnegie's death in 1955 and developed the business into a multinational one with offices in 70 countries, 5 million graduates and $187 million in annual sales.         With her strawberry blond hair, gleaming smile and rich Oklahoma twang -- Mrs. Carnegie was a student of Mr. Carnegie as well as his wife -- she proved as big a success in business as he was in motivational speaking. Though contemporaries in the 1950's wondered whether she had what it took to continue Mr. Carnegie's quintessentially enigmatic enterprise, she scoffed at such skepticism. She told a reporter in 1973 that she immediately took over the operations ''so that I have no time to sit and whittle and spit.''         Even before she met its creator, she had become an early devotee of the Carnegie approach to self-improvement. His book was first published in 1936 and took America by storm with its simple, upbeat message. Even the most retiring people can learn to wow a crowd, he wrote. Look people in the eye, shake hands firmly, flash a winning smile and remember names. Never complain or blame other people.         In the early 1940's, she was Dorothy Price Vanderpool, a divorced mother with a baby daughter to support because of what she called an ''unfortunate teen-aged marriage.'' She took a Carnegie course at a Y.M.C.A. in Tulsa and afterward credited the skills she acquired for the jump she made from stenographer in the Gulf Oil Corporation's accounting department to a senior secretary in the executive suite. She also became president of Tulsa's Young Republicans Club.         Her improvement so impressed Carnegie people that the company offered her a job in New York. She became Mr. Carnegie's secretary in January 1944 and, several months later, his second wife. He later made her his business partner.         Following his style, she collected anecdotes and how-to case histories for a book she wrote, ''How to Help Your Husband Get Ahead in his Social and Business Life,'' published in 1953. Among the homespun advice she offered wives eager to please their husbands were such aphorisms as ''Share his interests and ideals'' and ''Try some intelligent listening. Be a sounding board or a wailing wall.''         But Mrs. Carnegie put business before her personal writing and teaching interests. She once started the Dorothy Carnegie Course, a workshop for women, by women, in contrast to the male-centered Dale Carnegie program. It never took off financially, however, and her business instincts prevailed over her desire to offer a women-only alternative. She did preside over a sharp rise in the number of women taking the regular course.         Her genius was to transform Dale Carnegie Training into a staple of corporate America. She once contended that 400 of the Fortune 500 companies sent employees to study at the company. It became a right of passage for young executives who sought to develop the confidence to present themselves well in public settings. Companies, moreover, paid the enrollment fees, which can now surpass $1,000 for a two-week session.         Graduates were often the best advertisement. The chicken magnate Frank Perdue attended, as did Mary Kay Ash of Mary Kay cosmetics. So did Lee A. Iacocca, the former chief of the Chrysler Corporation.         ''For the first few years of my life I was an introvert, a shrinking violet,'' the sometimes brash auto executive wrote in his autobiography, ''Iacocca.'' ''But that was before I took a course in public speaking at the Dale Carnegie Institute.'' Even the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders spruced up their smiles with the help of Carnegie teachers.         Mrs. Carnegie had a casual working style. She vowed that employees would never find her sitting idly behind a desk. She dictated letters from the porch of her home in Forest Hills Gardens and ran meetings by telephone from her ranch in the Black Hills of Wyoming. She decorated her office with a bronze Philip La Verne conference table, an expensive statement of taste in the late 1960's.         Mrs. Carnegie remarried in 1976, to David Rivkin, also of Tulsa. She retired from active management of the closely held company in 1978 in favor of her son-in-law, J. Oliver Crom, though she remained chairwoman.         She is survived by Mr. Rivkin and her daughter, Donna Dale Carnegie of Lake Oswego, Ore. Another daughter, Rosemary Crom, died earlier. She is also survived by three grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren and three stepchildren.       
         Muriel Humphrey Brown, who grew from a shy girl from South Dakota into a confident woman during political campaigns for her first husband, Hubert H. Humphrey, and then was named to fill his seat in the Senate at his death in 1978, died today at Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis. She was 86 and lived in Plymouth, Minn.         In recent years, Mrs. Brown appeared rarely in public but on Tuesday stood at the side of her son, Hubert Humphrey 3d, Minnesota's Attorney General, when he won the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party nomination for governor.         ''Hubert would have been proud,'' she said after her son's victory.         There were many victories in the lives of Hubert and Muriel Humphrey and many setbacks as well. After Humphrey served as Vice President under Lyndon Baines Johnson, he lost to Richard M. Nixon in 1968 when Johnson decided against seeking re-election.         Humphrey had also been defeated for his party's Presidential nomination in 1960 by John F. Kennedy. Muriel Humphrey was at her husband's side for these elections and when he died after returning to the Senate, she was a logical and sentimental choice to succeed him until the 1978 election, when she did not run to keep the seat.         Because of her shyness she had to work at the roles that came to her.         ''If someone had told me what would be happening to me today,'' she said after the Democrats nominated Humphrey for President in 1968, ''well, it would have been an awful thing to have thought of. I just wanted to be a wife.''         Hubert Horatio Humphrey ran for Mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, and it was then that Muriel Buck Humphrey, born in Huron, S.D., became the constant campaigner of the constant candidate.         In her roles as the wife of a public figure and in her own brief time in the Senate, Muriel Humphrey supported the social programs that her husband championed. She pressed for the right of a woman to have an abortion and, when her granddaughter Vicky was born mentally disabled, she became involved in work for people with mental disabilities.         In 1988, when President George Bush disparaged liberalism, Muriel Humphrey responded: ''There's something I've been wanting to say for a long time. I'm a liberal and I'm proud of it. In fact, I was probably a little more liberal than Hubert was. I just wanted to say that.''         By then she was Muriel Humphrey Brown, having married Max Brown, a widowed Nebraska businessman who had been a classmate in Huron.         In addition to her husband and her son Hubert 3d, Mrs. Brown is survived by a daughter, Nancy Solomonson, and two other sons, Bob and Douglas, all of suburban Minneapolis; 12 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren.       
         Muriel Humphrey Brown, who grew from a shy girl from South Dakota into a confident woman in the political campaigns for her first husband, Hubert H. Humphrey, and then was named to fill his seat in the Senate at his death in 1978, died on Sunday at Abbott Northwestern Hospital in Minneapolis. She was 86 and lived in Plymouth, Minn.         In recent years, Mrs. Brown appeared rarely in public but on Tuesday stood at the side of her son, Hubert H. Humphrey 3d, Minnesota's Attorney General, when he won the Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party nomination for governor.         ''Hubert would have been proud,'' she said after her son's victory.         There were many victories in the lives of Hubert and Muriel Humphrey and many setbacks as well. After Humphrey served as Vice President under Lyndon B. Johnson, he lost to Richard M. Nixon in 1968 when Johnson decided against seeking re-election while the war in Vietnam raged.         Humphrey had also been defeated for his party's Presidential nomination in 1960 by John F. Kennedy. Muriel Humphrey was at her husband's side for these elections and when he died after returning to the Senate, she was a logical and sentimental choice to succeed him until the 1978 election, when she did not run to keep the seat.         Because of her shyness -- she once said she was afraid to address her own women's club -- she had to work at the roles that came to her.         ''If someone had told me what would be happening to me today,'' she said after the Democrats nominated Humphrey for President in 1968, ''well, it would have been an awful thing to have thought of. I just wanted to be a wife. I didn't even know how I'd be a mother. I would have been horrified to have thought of this.''         Hubert Horatio Humphrey ran for Mayor of Minneapolis in 1943, and it was then that Muriel Buck Humphrey, born in Huron, S.D., became the constant campaigner of the constant candidate.         The Humphreys met in the early 1930's when Muriel was a student at Huron College. They married in 1936, and Mrs. Humphrey worked as a bookkeeper at a utility company to put her husband through college.         In her roles as the wife of a public figure and in her own brief time in the Senate, Muriel Humphrey supported the social programs that her husband championed. She pressed for the right of a woman to have an abortion and, when her granddaughter Vicky was born mentally disabled, she became involved in work for people with mental disabilities.         In 1988, when President George Bush disparaged liberalism, Muriel Humphrey responded: ''There's something I've been wanting to say for a long time. I'm a liberal and I'm proud of it. In fact, I was probably a little more liberal than Hubert was. I just wanted to say that.''         By then she was Muriel Humphrey Brown, having married Max Brown, a widowed Nebraska businessman who had been one of her classmates when she graduated from high school in 1930. At the time, in 1981, Mr. Brown's sister, Dona, said, ''They never dated, but the families kept up with one another.''         In addition to her husband and her son Hubert 3d, Mrs. Brown is survived by a daughter, Nancy Solomonson, and two other sons, Bob and Douglas, all of suburban Minneapolis; 12 grandchildren, and 3 great-grandchildren.       
         Betty Carter, one of jazz's great singers and a composer and arranger whose groups were virtual schools for generations of jazz musicians, died at home in the Fort Greene section of Brooklyn on Saturday. She was 69.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said her friend Ora Harris.         Ms. Carter sounded like no one in jazz, with her own diction, her own phrasing and her own sense of pitch. Though she was firmly inside the jazz-singing tradition, she was an abstractionist as well, and for her words were pliable. On her early material -- she began a solo recording career in the mid-1950's -- her light, pure voice sounded instrumental, with curved, beautifully shaped notes. It was immediately noticeable that she was after something different, and that her technique, always extraordinary, was there to work for her ideas. It was equally clear that she was a jazz musician first and a singer second.         About a decade after beginning her recording career, Ms. Carter refined her originality into a style that became the template for modern jazz singing. On ''Look No Further,'' recorded in 1964, Ms. Carter uses her voice against the bass, then as the band comes in her note choice mirrors the experimentation of instrumentalists like John Coltrane and Miles Davis; during the same session she recorded ''My Favorite Things,'' a composition associated with Mr. Coltrane. Her improvisations were explosive, tumbling out in great leaps at a velocity that expressed unfettered artistic freedom.         But it was artifice. Ms. Carter was one of jazz's most articulate small-group arrangers, and few musicians have ever controlled tempo the way  she had; woe to the young musicians in the band who could not navigate the shockingly abrupt tempo changes or keep up with Ms. Carter's fastest or slowest tempos. Her snapping fingers, marking off the time, sent generations of musicians back to the practice room, chagrined.         In her hands a standard or her own compositions often contrasted some of jazz's slowest tempos with some of its fastest. She wasn't afraid to pare down the instrumentation of a group for a while, singing against piano or bass, orchestrating the arrival of other instruments. And the constant tempo-changing gave the impression of emotional extremity and careful control of the artistic environment. She sculptured sound, and it made her concerts some of the most moving experiences in jazz, a mixture of the emotional power of the songs' texts and the sheer joy of her imagination.         ''I started to change my material to keep the musicians interested,'' Ms. Carter said in a 1992 interview with The New York Times. ''What do you do with a chorus and a half? You change things, stretch them out, change speed. Most musicians I played with were so good they could do what was necessary.''         Ms. Carter grew up in Detroit, which in the 1940's and 1950's was a good environment for jazz musicians, with the city producing some of the best musicians of the time.         Detroit was a stop on the jazz circuit, and a young Ms. Carter sang with Charlie Parker, who came through town. One of her nicknames was Betty Bebop, a tribute to her interests. In 1948 she began working with Lionel Hampton and his band, staying with the vibraphonist until 1951, when, during a performance in New York, she decided to remain there. During the same time she recorded the female part for King Pleasure's version of ''Red Top,'' singing a vocal rendition of Gail Brockman's original trumpet solo.         In New York in 1955 and '56, Ms. Carter began recording for Epic Records and generally taking in the  city. In 1957, she recorded with Wynton Kelly and other peers; her work was irregular partly because her style was more jazz than cabaret, and partly because she tried to avoid  the abusive working situations that have plagued jazz.         In 1961 Ms. Carter recorded what has become a classic album, ''Ray Charles and Betty Carter,'' with Mr. Charles; it features the pair singing astringent duets including a famous version of ''Baby, It's Cold Outside.'' Ms. Carter worked with Mr. Charles from 1960 to 1963, the year she toured Japan with Sonny Rollins and recorded an orchestral album for Atco Records.         Through the 1960's Ms. Carter struggled with her career, recording with Roulette Records in the late 1960's, during which the avant-garde and pop music rendered some artists identified with an older style commercially irrelevant. But in 1969 she started her own recording company, Bet-Car Productions, and on that label she released her albums.         In 1988 Ms. Carter began a relationship with Verve Records that included the reissue of the Bet-Car label along with the recording of a series of new albums. That same year she released ''Look What I Got!,'' which won a Grammy, and in 1994 she recorded an album, ''Feed the Fire,'' with the pianist Geri Allen, the bassist Dave Holland and the drummer Jack DeJohnette.         Also during the 1980's Ms. Carter, finally recognized for her innovations, became a concert draw internationally. She recorded duets with Carmen McRae, and she kept turning out well-rounded musicians, having trained them in her trio. Included in the alumni from the 1980's and the 1990's were the pianists Cyrus Chestnut, Benny Green, Stephen Scott, Marc Cary, Darrell Grant and Travis Shook. And her choice of drummers was extraordinary, having hired Greg Hutchinson, Clarence Penn, Winard Harper, Troy Davis and Lewis Nash. She began receiving numerous awards, including the National Medal of Arts given last year by President Clinton.         In 1993 she began the Jazz Ahead series at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, a program that featured young and promising musicians.  This year the Jazz Ahead series was invited to appear at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington.         Ms. Carter is survived by two sons, Myles and Kagle Redding, both of New York City. A marriage to James Redding ended in divorce.         ''The survival of jazz culture takes priority,'' Ms. Carter said in the interview with The Times. ''The survival of this culture depends on people playing it and living the life. The young guys playing it in 20 years will be taking the music somewhere else. There was a period where, in jazz, the music sent people away. But it's now back to making people feel better, putting happy smiles on their faces. When I was coming up, that's what jazz was about. It wasn't about money. It was about how happy you could make people.''       
         Inge Aicher-Scholl, who inspired a generation of pacifists in post-World War II Germany by writing about an anti-Nazi youth movement and the killing of her brother and sister, died on Friday. She was 81, and suffered from cancer.         Mrs. Aicher-Scholl moved millions of Germans toward nonviolence by chronicling the activities of the White Rose, a student movement whose leaders included her younger brother and sister, Hans and Sophie Scholl.         Both siblings were killed by Nazis on Feb. 22, 1943, and their parents were imprisoned by Nazi authorities for several months.         In 1952 Mrs. Aicher-Scholl published a book describing White Rose's nonviolent resistance to the Third Reich and its brutal repression by the Nazis. Written in spare and dispassionate prose, the slim volume became a classic work of literature about the Third Reich.         Hans and Sophie Scholl ''came to represent not just the small band of youthful dissenters but all the pacifist sympathizers who were tracked by the Gestapo and the innumerable anonymous victims who were forced to pay the price for believing that human rights were more important than obedience to arbitrary laws,'' wrote Albert von Schirndung, a cultural critic for the Munich daily Suddeutsche Zeitung.         The book's lack of pretension and its description of ordinary Germans lent it power. ''It would have been wrong to create new heroes,'' Mr. Schirndung wrote. ''One had already had enough of heroes. The characters in 'White Rose' were people one could identify with.''         The book and subsequent writing by Mrs. Aicher-Scholl influenced many Germans who grew up after the war, reinforcing what was already a deep revulsion against the militarism that had brought the country to catastrophe and moral disgrace.         In 1946 Mrs. Aicher-Scholl and several friends founded a school for adult education and art in Ulm. One of the co-founders was her future husband, designer Otl Aicher. Mrs. Aicher-Scholl headed the school from 1946 to 1974, and remained active in Germany's peace movement throughout her life.         In the 1980's, she was a prominent figure in anti-military movements that bitterly but unsuccessfully opposed plans by the German government and NATO to station nuclear missiles in West Germany.         In 1985 she was arrested for taking part in a sit-in at the American Pershing II missile base at the southern town of Mutlangen. She and other protesters were charged with disrupting public order and given suspended fines.         Mrs. Aicher-Scholl, who died at home in Leutkirch, in southern Germany, is survived by four of her five children, Eva, Florian, Julian and Manuel; another child, Pia, died in a car accident in 1975, and her husband died in 1991.       
         Dr. Mary Steichen Calderone, the grande dame of sex education, died yesterday at the Kendal at Longwood nursing home in Kennett Square, Pa. She was 94 and had suffered from Alzheimer's disease for the last decade.         Indefatigable and fired by a zeal for sexual responsibility and realism, Dr. Calderone persuaded a recalcitrant American Medical Association to let doctors dispense birth control as a matter of course to their patients, and she set in motion the means of educating schoolchildren about human sexuality.         Dr. Calderone did more than any other individual to convince both the medical profession and the public that human sexuality goes far beyond the sex act. She heralded it as a multifaceted and vital part of a healthy life that should not be hidden under a shroud of secrecy or limited to erotic expression.         One of her favorite challenges to young audiences she addressed was to ask for a four-letter word ending in ''k'' that meant sexual intercourse. Over a chorus of titters, she would give her answer: ''talk.'' Then she would explain, ''We never talk to each other as nonsexual people.''         Dr. Calderone, the daughter of the photographer Edward Steichen, was a woman of many talents and diverse interests who did not find her true calling until midlife. Following graduation from Vassar College, where she majored in chemistry, she decided to go on the stage, but abandoned her acting career when she realized she could never be as good as Katherine Cornell.         At the age of 30, after a failed marriage to a fellow actor, W. Lon Martin, and the birth of two daughters, Nell and Linda, she decided to go to medical school.         She received an M.D. degree in 1939 from the University of Rochester and a master's degree in public health in 1942 from the Columbia University School of Public Health. While at Columbia she met Dr. Frank Calderone, then a district health officer on the Lower East Side who would soon become deputy commissioner of health for New York City and her second husband. The couple was married in 1941.         Dr. Calderone served for some years as a school physician in Great Neck, L.I. In 1953 she became medical director of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, where she carried forward Margaret Sanger's mission for family planning.         In 1964 Dr. Calderone realized one of her crowning goals: she convinced the trustees of the American Medical Association that the nation's leading organization of physicians should disseminate information on reproduction and birth control and endorse the prescription of birth control measures to all patients who needed them. The trustees' proposal was adopted, helping to move birth control into the mainstream of American medicine.         Three years earlier, as a representative of family planning, she took part in the first American Conference on Church and Family run by the National Council of Churches. Attended by sociologists, religious leaders, educators and public health professionals, the conference highlighted the suffering of thousands of people because of ignorance about frigidity, impotence, homosexuality and contraception.         With five colleagues at the conference, Dr. Calderone set up an informal committee to study human sexuality. Out of that committee grew Dr. Calderone's signature achievement, the co-founding of the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States in 1964. Dr. Calderone then resigned from Planned Parenthood to turn her attention from reproductive biology to education in human sexuality.         Better known by its acronym Siecus, the council was created to help teachers, therapists and other professionals establish human sexuality as an integral part of health and health education. Under her guidance, Siecus became the moving force for education about human sexuality in the schools as well as in the community. The organization publishes ''Guidelines for Sexuality Education: Kindergarten through 12th Grade'' and helps schools around the country set up comprehensive sex education programs.         As the president of Siecus, Dr. Calderone stood out in the 1960's as an innovator, one of a handful of educators, scientists and philosophers who were beginning to address the big topics of human existence like death and sexuality. She was an unstinting advocate for the acceptance of masturbation as a wholesome, normal and almost universal practice for people of all ages.         Dr. Calderone was far more than a female doctor championing a cause. Her theatrical training, coupled with her carriage, poise and authoritative voice, helped her to get her message across that children are born sexual beings and remain so until they die and that people of all ages need and deserve a proper sexual education.         Dr. Calderone believed sex education in the schools should start in kindergarten, and under her direction Siecus helped to set up sex education programs in thousands of schools throughout the country. After stepping down from the presidency, she joined New York University as an adjunct professor in its program on human sexuality. She was active professionally until age 80.         Almost from birth, Mary Steichen was a natural leader: optimistic, determined, resilient and forthright, who from early childhood knew how to speak her mind. At age 6, for example, she criticized the sculptor Constantin Brancusi, a family friend, for creating ''L'Oiseau d'Or'' with a horizontal head, a position that she said would make it impossible for the bird to sing. Brancusi's later bird sculptures had more uplifted heads.         Her imposing appearance combined with her strong personality helped her advance her causes and also to defend them against attacks by groups like the Christian Crusade, the John Birch Society and Moral Majority, who contended that her promotion of sex education in schools was encouraging a premature and unhealthy participation in sexual experience and usurping the role of parents in guiding their children's lives. Her reply was that if parents were doing their job properly there would be no need for school-based sex education.         A devout Quaker and a Republican, she was once labeled by the John Birch Society as an ''aging sexual libertine.'' She reminded her critics that modern children were in desperate need of sex education because they were sexually vulnerable: ''devoid of chaperones, supervision, rules and close family relations and subject to onslaughts of commercial sexual exploitation.''         But recognizing that a child's sexual attitudes are often shaped before school age, Dr. Calderone also focused on educating parents. Through Siecus she established Parent Learning Centers to teach adults about their own sexuality as well as their children's.         In 1981 she and Eric Johnson wrote a widely praised book, ''The Family Book About Sexuality,'' which was published in five languages. The following year, she and James W. Ramey were the co-authors of ''Talking With Your Child About Sex,'' published in four languages.         Dr. Calderone also contributed to many professional publications and served as editor of texts on abortion and family planning.         Though Dr. Calderone saw serendipity as a major architect of her success, she did not always lead a charmed life. She grew up as the daughter of a working artist. Her mother, Clara, was considered cold, and their relationship adversarial.         When her parents divorced, Mary, then 10, chose to live with her father. Not until nearly seven decades after the divorce was she able to bury the emotional hatchet that had estranged her from her mother.         Dr. Calderone's own experiences as a mother were also difficult. Her 8-year-old daughter, Nell, died of pneumonia, plunging her into a debilitating depression.         Her marriage to Dr. Calderone, who later became chief administrative officer of the World Health Organization, produced two more daughters, Dr. Francesca Calderone-Steichen, a gerontologist, and Dr. Maria Calderone, a veterinarian in Galena, Ohio, born almost 20 years after her oldest daughter, Linda Hodes, a psychotherapist in Albuquerque, N.M.         The Calderones separated in 1979 but never divorced. Dr. Frank Calderone died in 1987.         In addition to her daughters, Mary Calderone is survived by three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.         Correction:  November 10, 1998, Tuesday  An obituary on Oct. 25 about Dr. Mary S. Calderone, who battled political and religious groups to take sex education to schools, misstated her political affiliation. She was a Democrat, not a Republican. The list of survivors also misidentified the public health degree held by a daughter, Francesca Calderone-Steichen, a gerontologist. It is a master's, not a doctorate.       
         Deidre S. Murphy, assistant managing editor for news at The Star-Ledger of Newark, died on Thursday at St. Mary Hospital in Hoboken. She was 47.         Ms. Murphy was hospitalized after suffering a stroke on Wednesday night as she walked near her home in Hoboken, said Scott Ladd, metropolitan editor of The Star-Ledger.         Ms. Murphy, known as Dee, went to New York in 1988 to be an assistant city editor and was later deputy metro editor at New York Newsday, where she helped supervise the paper's coverage of a subway crash that killed five people, caused by a motorman who was drunk. The coverage won the Pulitzer Prize for spot news in 1992. She also helped lead a team of the paper's reporters who  covered the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center.         In 1995, after New York Newsday was closed, she went to work at The Star-Ledger, overseeing the paper's news-gathering operation. She left briefly to be metropolitan editor at The Daily News in 1997, then returned to The Star-Ledger.         Ms. Murphy was born in Springfield, Ill. Her first newspaper job was as a reporter for her hometown paper, The State Journal-Register, and she later worked as a reporter and city editor at The Democrat and Chronicle in Rochester.         She is survived by her companion, Theadora Martens, and her mother, Helen Murphy of Springfield.       
         Haru Matsukata Reischauer, a journalist and author who was influential in diplomatic affairs in the 1960's as the wife of the United States Ambassador to Japan, died on Sept. 23 in La Jolla, Calif. She was 83.         The cause of death was heart failure, a former colleague said.         Mrs. Reischauer's deep understanding of both Japanese and American cultures and mores made her highly qualified to ease tensions between the two countries in the early 60's. As the embassy's First Lady, she was crucial, her former colleagues said, in bringing a psychological end to the postwar occupation of Japan.         She grew up in Tokyo, the daughter of a prominent Japanese statesman and a mother who was an American of Japanese descent. As a child, she had an American tutor, and she graduated from Principia  College in Illinois.         Late in life, she traced the roots of her family's tradition of statesmanship and their appreciation of America. In ''Samurai and Silk: A Japanese and American Heritage'' (Harvard University Press, 1986) she told the story of her two grandfathers: one, born to a peasant family, became a wealthy silk merchant in New York; the other, from a samurai family, rose to be Prime Minister twice and a powerful Finance Minister responsible for overhauling Japan's financial system in the 19th century.         Not until the end of World War II -- which she spent in Japan, feeling ''totally out of place,'' said a colleague from her embassy days -- did her bicultural background become useful.         ''Suddenly, everything opened up,'' said George R. Packard, who is now president of the U.S.-Japan Foundation in New York. During the 1950's, she wrote regularly about Japan for The Saturday Evening Post and The Christian Science Monitor.         But it was through her husband that she became an major influence in establishing friendly relations between the United States and Japan. The writer James Michener introduced her to Edwin O. Reischauer, a widower with three children and a Harvard professor of Japanese Studies. As teen-agers, it turned out, they had gone to the same Tokyo high school, where she had had a secret crush on him.         Robert Immerman, a senior research associate at Columbia University's East Asian Institute, who also worked at the American Embassy when she was there, said that before her marriage in 1956, ''she was never at home in either culture.'' Afterward, he said, she moved easily in both. ''Somehow that relationship fulfilled her.''         In 1961, President John F. Kennedy appointed Mr. Reischauer Ambassador to Japan. ''Relations seemed to be coming apart,'' Mr. Packard said. The Japanese Government was under pressure at the time from groups on the left that wanted to end the security arrangement with the United States.         In those tense times, Mrs. Reischauer could easily have found herself distrusted by both the Americans and the Japanese. Instead, said Mr. Packard -- who was then a special assistant to the Ambassador -- she became widely respected, even esteemed.         She came to be considered Japan's most popular woman, after the Empress. She went out of her way to be considerate with embassy employees, said Mr. Immerman, a junior embassy officer at the time. For instance, she opened the swimming pool, long reserved for the Ambassador's family, to everyone. She brought in influential Japanese people ignored by earlier administrations -- intellectuals, writers and leaders of citizens' groups.         She and her husband were a team.  Before making decisions, Mr. Reischauer would consult with his wife, Mr. Immerman recalled.         ''She had a major role in helping him shape U.S. policy,'' he said.         In 1966, at the conclusion of his appointment, the Reischauers returned to Cambridge, Mass., and to Harvard. Later, they went to California. Mr. Reischauer died in 1990.         One stepson, Robert D. of Bethseda, Md., following the family tradition of public service, went on to become director of the Congressional Budget Office and is now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.  She is also survived by two stepdaughters, Ann Heinemann of La Jolla and Joan Simon of Larchmont, N.Y.; two sisters, Naka Rawthroen of Los Angeles and Mari Bruck of Studio City, Calif.; nine grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.         Mr. Packard described her role in bringing together the United States and Japan. ''She, herself, was a bridge,'' he said. ''She represented an America that was friendly and respectful to Japan.''       
         Kathleen Lukens, a more or less ordinary woman whose life had such an ordinary focus on her children it is a wonder how much people made of what she saw as routine maternal devotion, died on Tuesday at her home in Tappan, N.Y. She was 67 and had been executive director of Camp Venture, a Rockland County service organization for the developmentally disabled that she founded in 1969.         Her family said the cause was cancer.         A 1952 Barnard College graduate who taught a year at a private girls' school and worked another year as a police reporter and feature writer for The Bergen Evening Record before marrying and settling into a suburban routine, Mrs. Lukens, who was born in Philadelphia and grew up in northern New Jersey, was typical of a generation of women who put their families before careers.         As a standard P.T.A. mom cum after-school chauffeur with the usual array of committee meetings and volunteer work, Mrs. Lukens, a labor organizer's daughter who was also active in the antinuclear and civil rights movements, did pretty much what any suburban mother of her era did. And if her refrigerator to-do list was a bit longer than most, she did, after all, have five children with varying needs to take care of.         As the children came along, Mrs. Lukens simply dealt with their needs as a matter of routine, feeding them, keeping them clean, nursing them through childhood illnesses and sending them off to school and camp.         It was a routine that varied only in the details. When her fourth son, David, turned out to be autistic, for example, and she discovered there were no camps in Rockland County for children with such developmental disabilities, Mrs. Lukens, who had previously helped start a nursery school for her three older sons, did the obvious thing: She started a camp for David.         She called it Camp Venture, and if at first it was more venture than camp, when it comes to taking care of children, one thing tends to lead to another, and almost before Mrs. Lukens knew it, David had grown up and she had built Camp Venture into a sprawling multiservice organization with an $18 million, largely Medicaid-financed, annual budget that now operates 15 supervised group homes, 4 day service centers and  other programs that serve about 1,000 Rockland County adults and children with an array of developmental disorders, including autism, Down syndrome and cerebral palsy.         To be sure, Mrs. Lukens, who told David's story in a 1989 novella, ''Song of David,'' had some help, including loving assistance from her husband, Dr. John H. Lukens, a clinical psychologist, from David's four siblings, including his little sister, and from other parents, some of whom moved to Rockland County so they could join Mrs. Lukens's enterprise and their children could benefit from Camp Venture.         Not that it was easy. At a time when the mentally retarded and those with other developmental disabilities were routinely warehoused in indifferent state institutions like the notorious Letchworth Village, to win the required government financing for supervised group homes, Mrs. Lukens had to become a public advocate, buttonholing politicians and organizing campaigns for reform.         Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller was so impressed with her eloquent appeals that he asked her to become a speechwriter. In their turns, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo declared her New York State 1984 woman of the year and named her to his advisory council on mental retardation and developmental disabilities and Gov. George E. Pataki named her to the state Provider Council in 1996.         By then, Mrs. Lukens had received so many honors and heard so much  praise it was a wonder she had any time for her nine grandchildren.         Not surprisingly, perhaps, four of Mrs. Lukens's children grew up to go into some form of social work: her oldest son, Mark, is a minister in East Rockaway, N.Y.; Jonathan of Carmel, N.Y., and her daughter, Margaret Byrne, of Orangeburg, N.Y., are clinical social workers and Daniel, of Congers, N.Y., is his mother's successor as executive director of Camp Venture.         David, now 36, has what his family describes as a happy life, living at a Camp Venture group home in New City, N.Y., and participating in activities at a Camp Venture day services center, all thanks to the efforts of a more or less ordinary woman who saw her duty as making sure her children got the care they needed.       
         Sarah Korein, who acquired some of the choicest real estate in Manhattan through bare-knuckle tactics cloaked by grandmotherly charm, died on Thursday at the North Division of Beth Israel Medical Center. She was 93 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said her daughter, Elysabeth Kleinhans, a lawyer who manages the real estate business with other family members.         Even in a city in which real estate is a popular obsession on a par with sports and soap operas, Mrs. Korein (KO-reen) was almost unknown outside professional circles -- exactly as she preferred it. Her name rarely appeared in public.         And the face that she did present was more Dresden doll than Machiavellian negotiator. But buyers or sellers who assumed they were sitting across the table from sweetness and light did so at their peril.         ''She was the toughest deal maker imaginable,'' said Mary Ann Tighe, executive managing director of Insignia/ESG, a real estate brokerage and management concern. ''She squeezed out every last penny.''         Mrs. Korein could even profit from property she never owned.         In the early 1960's, for instance, she put a $250,000 deposit down on the Osborne Apartments, 205 West 57th Street. Advised against consummating the purchase because the building had no long-term investment value, she had to figure a way out of the deal.         So she reached out to a reporter for The New York Times to say that she planned to demolish the Osborne and replace it with a new tower, her son, Dr. Julius Korein, recalled.         When tenants besieged her office the next day, she comforted them. ''I don't want to take anyone's home away,'' she insisted, offering to sell them the contract. They paid her $500,000, not only taking her off the hook but also leaving her $250,000 richer.         ''She certainly was one of the best negotiators I've ever met,'' said the developer William Zeckendorf Jr. ''Perhaps in the beginning, people didn't take her seriously enough. It didn't take them long to find out.''         A common story in the real estate industry was that Mrs. Korein would keep different buyers in separate rooms and shuttle back and forth among the parties until she had extracted the terms she sought.         ''Even into her old age, everyone thought she was a charming, lovely little woman,'' her daughter said. ''Let me tell you, that's not where she was.''         Mrs. Korein's trophies speak for themselves.         At her death, her properties -- either land alone or both land and building -- included Lever House, the modernist landmark at 390 Park Avenue, between 53d and 54th Streets; the old Equitable Building, 120 Broadway, between Cedar and Pine Streets, a tower so gargantuan that it inspired New York's first zoning law in 1916, and One Penn Plaza on Seventh Avenue, between 33d and 34th Streets, the fifth-largest office building in the city.         She also owned the Delmonico Hotel, 502 Park Avenue, at 59th Street; the Swiss Center, 606 Fifth Avenue, at 49th Street, and two apartment towers on Central Park South, Nos. 220 and 240, overlooking Columbus Circle.         Mrs. Korein bought and sold the Beresford Apartments, 211 Central Park West, between 81st and 82d Streets; the former Croyden Hotel, 12 East 86th Street, at Madison Avenue; the former Fifth Avenue Hotel, 24 Fifth Avenue, at Ninth Street, and the Schwab House apartments, a full-block complex between West End Avenue and Riverside Drive, 73d and 74th Streets.         The family will not estimate the size and value of her portfolio, and not only because owners are customarily loath to disclose such things (tax assessors read the newspapers). Rather, Mrs. Korein held a variety of positions with any number of partners, making it difficult to apportion her share.         Whatever the bottom line, there was no question that she was wealthy and tough -- a ''great realtor,'' in the words of Leona Helmsley, perhaps the only figure to whom she might immediately be likened.         Ms. Tighe said Mrs. Korein was ''always an object of fascination, certainly to women coming up in the business but even to men, because there was no one else of her gender who accomplished what she did when she did.''         But while both Mrs. Korein and Mrs. Helmsley were known for being as aggressive as necessary to survive in the male-dominated industry, there was a significant difference: Mrs. Korein created her portfolio from scratch.         Sarah Rabinowitz was born in Germany and reared in Palestine, where she met Isidor Korein, a Hungarian engineer who arrived there after World War I. They married and immigrated to the United States in 1923.         In 1931, for $6,000, the Koreins bought a six-story apartment house in the East Flatbush section of Brooklyn -- not as an investment but so that family members would have a place to live rent free.         Their first substantial investment, in 1941, was a large apartment building at 8701 Shore Road in the Bay Ridge section of Brooklyn. To make the units more attractive, Mrs. Korein bought dozens of refrigerators and stored them in the building's emptied-out swimming pool.         With the advent of World War II, refrigerator production virtually ended as industry retooled for military needs. So Mrs. Korein was able to sell the refrigerators at a high profit. And because of the shortage of apartments, she was able to rent up the Shore Road building even without the new refrigerators.         ''One of her major secrets was somehow being in the right place at the right time with the right goods,'' Ms. Kleinhans said.         After the war and against her husband's wishes, Mrs. Korein pursued investment in Manhattan, beginning with 715 Park Avenue, an apartment building on the southeast corner of 70th Street. In time, she advised Francis Cardinal Spellman, the Archbishop of New York, on real estate, her children said.         Mrs. Korein made use of the nonamortizing mortgage, under which she would pay slightly higher interest rates but nothing toward principal, thus freeing cash for further investments. By the time the loan itself came due, her properties typically had appreciated so much in value that Mrs. Korein could easily pay off the amount.         ''All of her properties, without exception, did nothing but increase in value,'' said Andrew J. Singer, the chairman of the Singer & Bassuk Organization, who arranged financing for Mrs. Korein over many years.         Mr. Korein died in 1976. But even when he was alive, Mrs. Korein was the ''driving force,'' said Lawrence Friedland, the family's lawyer.         In the 1960's, he recalled, Mrs. Korein was about to sign a contract for the Beresford. At the last minute, her partners balked, fearing the risk of buying such a big building in what was then a rough-and-tumble neighborhood. She signed the contract anyway and more than doubled her money when she sold the property a few years later, Mr. Friedland said.         Perhaps Mrs. Korein's biggest false step was a foray into development in 1972, when she built an apartment house, the Elysabeth, 35 East 38th Street, between Park and Madison. It was not a success and she did not build again.         Besides Ms. Kleinhans and Dr. Korein, both of Manhattan, Mrs. Korein is survived by her sister, Esther Kessler of Naples, Fla.; four grandchildren, and nine great-grandchildren.         ''Into her 90's -- and I'm talking this year -- she would ask about cap rates and internal rates of return,'' Ms. Tighe said. ''She never lost her fascination with the business.''         Correction:  November 12, 1998, Thursday  An obituary on Nov. 4 about Sarah Korein, a New York real estate investor, referred incorrectly to her financing arrangements. Mrs. Korein was represented from 1977 to 1995 by Ackman Brothers & Singer, in which Lawrence D. Ackman and Andrew J. Singer were partners. Mr. Ackman arranged her financing before and after that time.       
         Esther Rolle, a pioneering African-American actress who gained national recognition in the 1970's for her role as Florida Evans on two television shows, first ''Maude'' and then ''Good Times,'' died at a hospital here on Tuesday. She was 78 and lived in Los Angeles.         Larry Calhoun, her longtime publicist, said the cause of death had not been determined, but he added that Ms. Rolle had been suffering from diabetes and had been under dialysis. He said she had celebrated her 78th birthday a little more than a week ago, and that one of the last things she had done was to write a check to support a local black theater, something she had done most of her career.         Ms. Rolle met with many of her old friends and cast members of the two television shows just last week in a gathering here for a People magazine article.         Norman Lear, one of the executive producers of both of her shows, said the once-stocky actress appeared thin but vibrant, and that she had a role in a forthcoming movie, ''Down in the Delta,'' directed by the poet Maya Angelou and scheduled for release this month.         Ms. Rolle became famous for playing the role of a strong-willed maid on television, and in that role she also performed memorably in the play ''A Raisin in the Sun,'' in the television movie ''Summer of My German Soldier,'' for which she won an Emmy award in 1979, and in the movie ''Driving Miss Daisy.'' She also appeared in the film ''Rosewood.''         But she spoke firmly and often about about her desire to fight black stereotypes on television and even left the cast of ''Good Times'' for a while, saying at the time that she resented the image presented by the buffoonish character of her son in the show. In the show she played the matriarch of a struggling black family in Chicago.         Ms. Rolle was well known for her strong personality, both on and off screen, and her ear for the nuances of race relations. Mr. Lear, who was the executive producer of ''All in the Family,'' from which ''Maude'' and ''Good Times'' were later spun off, said one of his most vivid memories of Ms. Rolle was a musical number she performed with Beatrice Arthur, the actress who played Maude.         Mr. Lear said that every year there was a musical number on the show, and one season Ms. Rolle and Ms. Arthur performed ''Me and My Shadow.'' Ms. Arthur kept trying to stand in back and play the shadow in the scene, but Ms. Rolle kept slipping behind her, a striking metaphor for the subtleties of race relations that Mr. Lear described as ''an indelible memory of an indelible woman.''         Ms. Rolle was born in Pompano Beach, Fla., a retirement community that was once a bucolic farming town with the character of the deep South. She was the 10th of 18 children and her father was a farmer.         She had a theatrical bent and after high school followed her sister, Rosanna Carter, also an actress, to New York. She was one of the early members of the Negro Ensemble Company in New York and in the late 1950's performed with Shologa Oloba, an African-American dance troupe. In 1958 she and her sister appeared with the company in a revival of Asadata Dafora's ''Zunguru.''         In 1990 she became the first woman to receive the N.A.A.C.P. Chairman's Civil Rights Leadership Award for her work improving the image of blacks.         Ms. Rolle's marriage ended in divorce and she had no children, her publicist said. She is survived by two sisters and a brother.       
         Edwige Feuillere, a much-loved French actress whose 60-year career took her from sensual screen beauty to grande dame of the Paris theater, died here on Nov. 13. She was 91 and lived in Paris. She was buried on Wednesday in a family tomb at Beaugency, near Orleans.         Ms. Feuillere first gained renown in 1935 when, shockingly for the time, she briefly appeared naked in Abel Gance's film ''Lucrece Borgia.'' And it was as a femme fatale that she achieved her greatest stage triumph, playing opposite Jean-Louis Barrault in Paul Claudel's ''Partage de Midi'' in 1947. But she was also frequently acclaimed for her interpretation of classical roles.         ''Edwige Feuillere was our Marlene Dietrich, our Irene Dunne and our Greta Garbo, all in one,'' Le Monde wrote after her death. She retired from the stage only six years ago after a final production in which she read from her best-known roles.         ''Now people can only see me as a very old person who had a mythical life,'' she said in a recent interview with a French writer. ''Ah, if only you had seen her when she was.'' She continued: ''Well, I'd like people to remember me for my best moment. But it could be when I was 25 or 50 or 70 or in my very last show.''         Her death, which prompted a wave of tributes from French political and cultural figures, came less than one week after that of Jean Marais, the handsome, swashbuckling French actor who played opposite Ms. Feuillere in Jean Cocteau's 1947 film ''L'Aigle a Deux Tetes.'' Cocteau had created the role for her, and she first created it onstage.         Stunningly beautiful in her youth, gracefully elegant in old age, Ms. Feuillere was remembered as much for her powerful well-modulated voice as for her expressive eyes and magnetic presence. Yet for all her popularity, she showed little interest in a glamorous life style. Modest and humorous in private, she was also self-deprecating about her talent in her 1977 autobiography, ''Les Feux de la Memoire.''         Ms. Feuillere was born Edwige Caroline Cunati on Oct. 29, 1907, in the town of Vesoul in eastern France. Her mother's family, originally from Alsace, had moved back to France after Germany occupied the region in the 1870 Franco-Prussian war. Her father was Italian and, because he was drafted by the Italian army in World War I, Edwige spent much of her childhood in Italy.         After the war, the family moved to Dijon in France where she showed interest in the theater by acting in school plays. In 1928 she began attending the Paris Conservatory of Dramatic Arts, and two years later she married a fellow student, Pierre Feuillere, although the marriage soon floundered because of his drug problems.         Ms. Feuillere's career -- she first used the stage name of Cora Lynn before taking her husband's name -- began slowly with small parts in several mediocre films, although she is remembered for her lead role in the film version of Marcel Pagnol's play ''Topaze.'' She also found work in the theater and was invited to join the Comedie Francaise, but she left after two years, complaining that she was being overlooked for major roles.         In 1939, she was cast as Marguerite Gautier in Alexandre Dumas's play ''La Dame aux Camelias,'' and she at last won recognition as a serious stage actor. At the time, the play's director, Jacques Hebertot, predicted, ''You will carry this role throughout your life, a slave to the success it will bring you.'' And he was right: she appeared in frequent revivals -- in France and Britain -- for the next two decades.         During Germany's occupation of France in World War II, Ms. Feuillere worked in the theater (she helped discover Gerard Philipe in Jean Giraudoux's ''Sodome et Gomorrhe'') and in films (notably in Jacques de Baroncelli's 1941 ''Duchesse de Langeais''). After the war, she appeared in 200 performances of ''L'Aigle a Deux Tetes'' before taking on another major role, which she would also perform again and again, as Yse in ''Partage de Midi.'' When she appeared in the role in London in 1968, the British theater critic Harold Hobson described her as the greatest actress he had ever seen.         Although she played an old woman in Patrice Chereau's 1974 film ''La Chair de l'Orchide,'' she virtually abandoned the cinema after 1960.  But she remained a pillar of the French theater, occasionally appearing onstage with her old movie partner Jean Marais, seven years her junior. In 1965, she created the lead role in Giraudoux's ''Madwoman of Chaillot'' and returned to the play on several occasions.         Ms. Feuillere had no immediate survivors.         She first announced her retirement in 1984, but promptly changed her mind and appeared frequently onstage throughout the 1980's. Finally, on the eve of her 85th birthday, she did retire. ''I have died so many times onstage,'' she said recently. ''My own will arrive one day, probably sooner than I expect.''         Correction:  December 3, 1998, Thursday  A picture caption on Nov. 23 with an obituary of the French actress Edwige Feuillere misstated the original nationality of the actor and director Erich von Stroheim, shown with her in an unidentified film. He was born in Austria, not Germany.       
         Vassar Miller, whose lifelong struggle with cerebral palsy made the simplest tasks arduous yet who wrote 10 volumes of searing and highly regarded poetry, died on Oct. 31 at Houston Methodist Hospital. She was 74.         Ms. Miller's work often explored religious themes, although she also wrote about her own pain and sense of isolation, and there were occasional flashes of acid humor. Poems collected in ''Wage War on Silence'' made her a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 1961. She also was twice named the poet laureate of Texas.         Many Texas writers and critics, most notably Larry McMurtry, lamented the lack of attention paid to her work, which had never been considered particularly fashionable until late in her career. ''That she is to this day little known, read or praised in Texas is the most damning comment possible on our literary culture,'' he wrote in a 1981 essay in The Texas Observer.         Shortly afterward, the Texas Legislature named Ms. Miller the state's poet laureate in 1982, and again in 1988. Last year she was named to the Texas Women's Hall of Fame by the Governor's Commission for Women.         ''If I Had Wheels or Love: Collected Poems of Vassar Miller,'' was published in 1990, drawing on her previous 10 volumes, including her first book of poems, ''Adam's Footprint,'' published in 1956, ''Onions and Roses'' (1968), ''If I Could Sleep Deeply Enough'' (1974) and ''Struggling to Swim on Concrete'' (1984).         The poem ''Change'' from the ''Onions and Roses'' collection is a favorite of her admirers:         I can remember the sun as a great golden eagle spreading its wings to my will.         Now it moves slowly, a buzzard drifting across the sky, over the carrion earth,         or swoops, a hawk, to seize the heart of a newborn puppy dropped from his pain-crazy mother.         Now I give thanks if its claws, absent-minded, release me into some weed patch of sleep.         ''Vassar Miller's poetry is direct, clear and tautly composed, with depths that are immediately accessible,'' a Houston Chronicle reviewer wrote in 1991. ''Her subjects are the same ones that keep most people searching beyond and beneath the surfaces of their daily lives; love, life, emotions and the unfilled longings of the disabled.''         Ms. Miller was born in Houston's museum district. She lived in the same house for most of her life, until increasing infirmity and poverty caused guardians to move her into a nearby nursing home.         She was born with cerebral palsy and always had great difficulty walking and talking. (Late in life she also lost the use of her hands, and she told an interviewer that her dream was to obtain a voice-activated computer so she could continue writing.)         Her stepmother encouraged her to learn to read and write, and urged her to attend public school, and her father led her to creative writing by teaching her to type. Ms. Miller eventually received degrees from the University of Houston and taught creative writing at the University of St. Thomas, near her home.         She was a familiar figure on the streets of the museum district, going from home to church to classes in her motorized cart. ''Sometimes it would tip over and she would laugh,'' Helen Havens, a rector at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church, which Ms. Miller attended for many years, told The Houston Chronicle in 1995. ''She had this raucous laughter. When she'd fall down walking, she'd say, 'Don't help me. I can do it myself.' ''         Ms. Miller is survived by two sisters, Joy Morton and Margaret Schomer, both of Houston.         In 1995, when her trust fund had been depleted, friends in Houston held three fund-raisers for her. But guardians said that she required full-time care and there was insufficient money to care for her at home, so she stayed at a nursing home.         She told an interviewer around that time that she felt her poetry would be best remembered for its metaphors, and she listed Bach oratorios and chocolate ice cream among her joys in life.         Asked to describe the meaning of her life, Ms. Miller said: ''To write. And to serve God.''       
         Rumer Godden, the prolific British author of ''Black Narcissus'' and  ''The River,'' and a writer of children's books that are enjoyed throughout the world, died on Sunday at her home in Dumfriesshire, Scotland. She was 90.         In a career that began in 1935, Ms. Godden published some 70 novels, children's books, memoirs, biographies and collections of poetry and  stories, many set in India, where she spent her childhood and had her first success as a writer. She also had the experience, rare for most authors, of seeing two of her most widely admired novels, ''Black Narcissus'' and ''The River,'' turned into films that became classics.         Ms. Godden's third novel, ''Black Narcissus'' (1939), first brought her critical attention and commercial success. It told the story of nuns in  the order of the Servants of Mary who try to overcome psychological and physical challenges to establish a hospital and school on a remote, windswept Himalaya mountain. ''Black Narcissus'' was also the first of Ms. Godden's novels to be brought to the screen, in a memorable 1946 film by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger that starred Deborah Kerr, David Farrar, Kathleen Byron, Sabu, Jean Simmons and Flora Robson.         Five years later Jean Renoir, the  French director, made ''The River,'' recognized as one of the great color films, an adaptation of Ms. Godden's novel about English children growing up in Bengal. Ms. Godden adapted her novel with Renoir and said that she learned invaluable lessons from him.         ''The River'' and ''Black Narcissus'' bore many of the trademarks of Ms. Godden's work. She was frequently praised for her rich settings and sensitive psychological portraits of children and headstrong, independent women. She was preoccupied with the loss of innocence, the moral problems of childhood and the nature of time. The lyricism and evocative power she often brought to her books sometimes disguised a toughness that addressed dark themes like poverty, jealousy, violence, sexual vulnerability and prejudice.         ''Ms. Godden has a magical skill in conjuring up with a few suggestive details a veritable panorama of Indian life,'' Orville Prescott once observed in The New York Times. ''And she has a wonderful way with fictional children, tender and true and never sentimental.''         In writing about Ms. Godden's  book ''Cromartie v. the God Shiva: Acting Through the Government of India,'' published last year, Bill Vourvoulias wrote in Newsday, ''One of the delights of reading a Rumer Godden novel is the magnetic pull of the exotic settings, affecting readers and characters alike.''         An Autobiography Written at Age 7         Margaret Rumer Godden was born on Dec. 10, 1907, in Sussex, England, the second of four daughters of Arthur Leigh and Katherine Hingley Godden. The family moved to India when she was less than a year old. Her father was a steamship agent and her childhood was spent in remote river towns throughout the British-ruled subcontinent. Until she was 12, Ms. Godden was largely educated by her family in a home that she later described as ''English streaked with Indian, or Indian streaked with English.''         Ms. Godden's precocity was evident during her early days in Bengal, where she wrote a fictional autobiography at age 7, vying with her sister Jon -- who also became a writer -- for the family literary laurels. As she later recalled, ''Part of the bliss of our childhood was that, being most of the year without the normal preoccupations of most girls of our ages, there was all the time in the world to think, avenues of time.''         These years left an indelible, earthy impression of India, quite unlike Kipling's land of the Raj. She evoked this in 1966 in the memoir ''Two Under the Indian Sun,'' which she wrote with Jon: ''The feel of the sunbaked Indian dust between sandals and bare toes; that and the smell. It was the honey smell of the fuzz-buzz flowers of thorn trees in  the sun, and the smell of open drains and urine, of coconut oil on shining black human hair, of mustard cooking oil and the blue smoke from cow dung used as fuel; it was a smell redolent of the sun, more alive and vivid than anything in the West.''         After their untrammeled Indian childhood, Ms. Godden and her sisters were sent to Britain in 1920 to complete their education. The change was shocking and Ms. Godden's time in Britain unhappy and rebellious, she wrote in her memoir ''A Time to Dance, No Time to Weep'' (1988). She bounced among  five schools before finally settling at  Moira House in Eastbourne, where her writing was encouraged. Later she attended ballet school despite a childhood spinal injury and was hooked on dance.         A Love of Dance And of Children         Ms. Godden returned to India in 1925 and opened a dancing school for children in Calcutta three years later, one of the first of its kind in that city. Overcoming social opprobrium, she operated the school for eight years. She considered a career as a choreographer, but in 1934 she married Laurence Sinclair Foster, a charming stockbroker and gambler  whom she later described as a philistine ''who thought Omar Khayyam was a curry.'' Their first child died shortly after birth, at the same time that Ms. Godden's first novel, ''Chinese Puzzle'' (1935), was accepted for publication. Although the couple subsequently had two daughters, their marriage ended in 1941 after Foster joined the army, leaving Ms. Godden with the children and huge gambling debts.         She moved with her children from Calcutta into the mountains of Kashmir, living in an isolated house set amid almond and cherry orchards. She supported her family through writing, teaching the local children, watching over the children of women doing war work in Calcutta, and selling herbal teas. She even survived a crazed cook's attempt to poison her before moving permanently to England in 1945.         Ms. Godden chronicled this time in ''Rungli-Rungliot'' (1943) and ''Bengal Journey'' (1945) and in other novels that addressed the transition from childhood to adolescence against the backdrop of life in colonial India. ''Kingfishers Catch Fire,'' a 1953 novel, concerned a widow and her two children living in Kashmir among people so poor that even a nail is worth stealing. The vicissitudes of time on family history was the theme of several of her novels set in Britain.         In London, in 1949, she married James Haynes-Dixon, a civil servant. Their marriage ushered in a long period of happiness, during which she continued to write, living  in London's Highgate section and in Henry James's Lamb House in Rye. Mr. Haynes-Dixon died in 1975. Ms. Godden is survived by two daughters, Paula Kenilworth and Jane Murray Flutter; four grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.         Acclaimed Novels That Became Films         Ms. Godden's novel ''The Greengage Summer,'' a critically acclaimed story about the sexual awakening of a teen-age girl in a pre-World War II French village, appeared in 1958; a film based on it called ''Loss of Innocence,'' starring Kenneth More, Danielle Darrieux and Susannah York, was released in 1961. ''The Battle of the Villa Fiorita'' (1963), a novel set in Italy about an adulterous affair seen through the eyes of two children who refuse to allow their mother to leave them and establish a new life, was also made into a film. So was ''In This House of Brede'' (1969), about a sophisticated London businesswoman who becomes a Benedictine nun.         To do research on ''In This House of Brede,'' Ms. Godden lived for three years near Stanbrook Abbey. Her experience with the nuns there contributed to her decision to convert to Roman Catholicism in 1968. In many of her stories and novels, Ms. Godden would write about the rewards and perils of the contemplative life.         Among her other work was ''Mooltiki: Stories and Poems from India'' (1957); ''A House with Four Rooms'' (1989), which takes up where ''A Time to Dance'' ended, and ''The Peacock Spring'' (1975), a novel about a British father and daughter in India who fall in love with Asians.         ''The Doll's House,'' the first and perhaps best known of her nearly two dozen children's books, appeared in 1947. The book told of a family of Dutch dolls owned by two girls in London. Like children, the dolls cannot act independently, but they can feel and wish for rooms of their own and comfortable feather beds. It was followed by many stories that interwove the lives of humans and dolls.         Ms. Godden did not patronize her younger readers and she had decided ideas about how to write for them. ''There are several things children  will not put up with in a book,'' she once observed. ''You have to have a proper beginning and end; you cannot have flashbacks. Then, you can't have a lot of description. And you must be very careful with words. They have to fit the case exactly and be chosen with extreme care.''         Ms. Godden's interest in children's literature also led her to write a biography of Hans Christian Andersen, compile a children's edition of Emily Dickinson's poems and translate two collections of verse by the French poet Carmen Bernos de Gasztold. She was given many prizes for her children's books and was awarded an Order of the British Empire in 1993.         Two years after her husband's death Ms. Godden moved to Scotland to live with her daughter Jane. She continued her routine of writing in the mornings and tending to her Pekingese dogs. She continued to write  widely translated children's books like ''The Little Chair'' (1996) and adult romances like ''Pippa Passes'' (1994), the story of a novice ballerina who falls in love with a gondolier in Venice.         She wrote into her final years and  never forgot India, returning to it in novels like ''Coromandel Sea Change'' (1991). ''To me and my kind,'' she once wrote, ''life itself is a story and we have to tell it in stories -- that's the way it falls. I have told the truth, yet not the whole truth, because that would be impossible.''       
         Anita Kurman Gulkin, president and chief executive of Greenwich House Inc., a social-service and cultural community organization based in Greenwich Village, died on Sunday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 59, lived in Springfield, N.J., and also had an apartment in Chelsea in Manhattan.         The cause was a heart attack during hip surgery last Friday, and she also had cancer, said Paul Racioppi, Greenwich House's chief development officer. She went to work as usual the day before the surgery.         Ms. Gulkin, a former specialist in programs for drug abusers, became Greenwich House's executive director in 1976. Her title was changed to president and chief executive in 1991.         The multifaceted organization has its headquarters at 27 Barrow Street, employs 250 people and also carries on its programs at seven other sites in and near Greenwich Village. In her 22 years as its senior salaried executive, its annual operating budget grew to $13.5 million from $1 million or less, Mr. Racioppi said.         In the years since 1986, Ms. Gulkin set into motion new Greenwich House programs for recovering alcoholics, other substance abusers and people with H.I.V. or AIDS, as well as for providing music and fine-arts classes in public elementary schools, for treating abused children and preventing child abuse and for serving hot meals for elderly Greenwich Villagers to eat together.         She joined Greenwich House's staff as a supervisor of its programs for drug abusers in 1968 and was made director of its substance abuse clinics in 1972.         Over the years, she was also active in other Manhattan social-service organizations. At her death, she was chairwoman of Caring Community, which administers programs for the elderly, mainly in Greenwich Village, and the West Side Association of Community Centers. She was also a co-founder and a former member of the board of what is now called Urban Pathways.         She was inducted into Greenwich Village's Hall of Fame and received the United Way's Big Apple Award.         A native of Newark, she received a bachelor's degree from Pennsylvania State University and later studied social work at Columbia.         She is survived by her husband, Sam Gulkin; a brother, Dr. Martin Kurman of Manhattan, and a sister, Bernice Winarsky of Springfield.       
         Mary Benjamin, an autograph dealer with such an authoritative eye for authenticity and such a sure sense of value that for decades she virtually dictated prices United States collectors paid for the writings of Presidents, poets and other prominent people, died on Monday at her home in Hunter, N.Y. She was 93 and had been so widely recognized as the nation's leading document authority that she regularly received mail addressed simply to ''The Autograph Lady.''         As a daughter of Walter R. Benjamin, a onetime New York Sun reporter who founded what is now the nation's oldest autograph dealership in Manhattan in 1887, Miss Benjamin, a native of Yonkers who graduated from Barnard, did not so much inherit her expertise as absorb it by osmosis during a 13-year apprenticeship at her father's elbow.         By the time she took over Walter R. Benjamin Autographs in 1940, Miss Benjamin had become so familiar with the handwritings of Presidents, cabinet secretaries, signers of the Declaration of Independence, Civil War generals and American and European composers, literary figures and the like that she could often tell at a glance not only if a document was authentic but which master forger had produced it if it was not.         Her expertise was so respected that once, when an auctioneer at a leading Manhattan gallery announced to the assembled bidders that the next item would be a George Washington letter, an audible snort of derision from Miss Benjamin was enough to cause the auctioneer to withdraw the document from the sale on the spot. As her snort had indicated, she had gotten a quick look at the letter moments earlier and recognized it as a forgery.         At a time when there were only a handful of dealers who handled autographs -- a term, meaning ''self-writing,'' that applies to anything, not simply the signature, written in a person's own hand -- Miss Benjamin's standing tended to overshadow her role as the only woman in the field.         Because of her reputation, experienced collectors and those with trunks full of old papers tended to seek her out, but Miss Benjamin was never satisfied with walk-in trade.         When it came to tracking down valuable documents, she was very much the daughter of the man who catapulted himself into the first ranks of his field in 1907. Learning that the Customs Service had sold 140 tons of old documents to a junk dealer, he persuaded the man to let him go through the refuse and ended up paying 25 cents each for thousands of documents signed by Presidents.         Similarly, when Miss Benjamin learned that the publishers of ''The Dictionary of American Biography'' had cleaned out its files of questionnaires filled out by 25,000 prominent Americans over two decades, she tracked down the junk dealer in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., who had picked them up and ended up acquiring hundreds of them, including three separate intimate questionnaires that had been filled out by President Franklin D. Roosevelt.         Aside from a photographic memory that allowed her to recognize a handwriting she had not seen in years and to rattle off obscure biographic details of more than 10,000 notable figures of the previous 500 years, Miss Benjamin, who bought and sold between 5,000 and 10,000 documents a year and maintained an inventory of some 50,000 documents in her office vaults, had an uncanny sense of their value in the market of the moment.         A woman whose passions could be inflamed by a surprise discovery, Miss Benjamin, a crack bridge player, once likened the thrill of opening a trunk of old letters to the feeling of anticipation she felt at picking up a hand at the bridge table.         In her 40's when she married Harold G. Henderson, a Columbia professor of Japanese art who had served on General MacArthur's staff and composed Emperor Hirohito's renunciation of divinity, Miss Benjamin soon drew her husband into her scholarly detective work. On weekends the couple, wearing kimonos, would sit in the backyard of their Manhattan town house reading old manuscripts.         They also became famous for dinner parties whose regular guests included the likes of Georgia O'Keeffe.         A boom in autograph collecting in the 1960's brought her more competition, but Miss Benjamin, whose oft-revised 1946 book, ''Autographs: A Key to Collecting,'' has been regarded as a standard in the field, remained a figure to be reckoned with.         After her husband's death, she moved her business to Hunter, about 40 miles southeast of Albany, in 1974 and continued to be active until 1995. It is now operated by her nephew Christopher Jaeckel, who became her assistant in 1971.         In addition to Mr. Jaeckel, Miss Benjamin is survived by a sister, Yolanda Jaeckel of Cranbury, N.J.; another nephew, Theodore Jaeckel of Princeton Junction, N.J., and a niece, Pamela Oppen of Hunter.       
         Margaret Walker Alexander, who wove her experience as a black woman in the Deep South into stories and poems that captured the struggles and desires of her race, died on Monday at the home of her daughter Marion Colmon in Chicago. She was 83 and lived in Jackson, Miss., on a street named for her.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Born Margaret Abigail Walker in 1915 in Birmingham, Ala., to a minister who was educated at Northwestern University in Evanston, Ill., she followed in her father's footsteps. A precocious child, Margaret learned to read while still a toddler and began writing poetry at 15 when she entered the university. She received a Ph.D. from the University of Iowa.         As a member of the W.P.A. writing program, Dr. Alexander considered herself part of the Chicago Renaissance, though she claimed to have been cultivated by the writers of the Harlem Renaissance a decade earlier, most notably her mentor, the poet Langston Hughes.         In 1942, she became the first black writer to win the Yale Series of Younger Poets competition, edited by Stephen Vincent Benet, for her poem ''For My People'' from a compilation by the same name.         In it, she wrote: ''Let a new earth rise. Let another world be born. Let a bloody peace be written in the sky. Let a second generation full of courage issue forth; let a people loving freedom come to growth.''         The poem, often quoted to describe the struggles of African-Americans, became a sort of anthem for the Civil Rights movement.         Dr. Alexander later became a professor at Jackson State University, where she founded the Institute for the Study of the History, Life and Culture of Black People in 1968. She served as its director for 11 years, and the center was later renamed in her honor.         In 1966 she published ''Jubilee,'' which told the life story of the daughter of a slave and a white plantation owner. The best-selling novel, The New York Times Book Review wrote, ''chronicled the triumph of a free spirit over many kinds of bondage.''         The novel was at the center of a heated dispute in 1977, when Dr. Alexander sued the author Alex Haley, alleging that his book ''Roots'' infringed on her copyright for ''Jubilee.'' The case was eventually thrown out of court.         ''I don't know anybody who has captured the heart and soul of black people any more than she did,'' Alferdteen Harrison, who became the director of the institute when Dr. Alexander stepped down, said. ''She was our model, our mentor. She had shown the way. That was the mark of greatness.''         In addition to her daughter Marion, Dr. Alexander, who was a widow, is survived by another daughter, Margaret Williams, and two sons, Firnist Alexander and Sigismund Alexander, all of Jackson, and nine grandchildren.       
         Honoria Murphy Donnelly, the daughter of Gerald and Sara Murphy, the golden couple at the center of the modernist whirl in 1920's Europe, who was dandled on the knees of the towering figures of the avant-garde, died on Tuesday at the Hospice of Palm Beach in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 81 and lived in Palm Beach Shores and East Hampton, N.Y.         The cause was liver cancer, said Amanda Vaill, the author of ''Everybody Was So Young: Gerald and Sara Murphy -- A Lost Generation Love Story'' (Houghton Mifflin).         Mrs. Donnelly, the eldest of the Murphys' three children and the only one to reach adulthood, published a biography of her parents, ''Sara & Gerald: Villa America and After'' (Times Books) written with Richard N. Billings, in 1982.         Attractive, cultured and well-to-do (Gerald was heir to the Mark Cross leather goods fortune, Sara the daughter of an industrialist and a grandniece of Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman), the Murphys epitomized the urbane insouciance of the jazz age. Although Gerald enjoyed a brief career as a painter -- his small output remains well regarded -- he and his wife were content to occupy backstage roles as bartenders, muses and sometime financial angels to the foremost writers, composers and artists of their age.         In return, the Murphys were memorialized (not always graciously) in the work they supported. They were the inspiration for Dick and Nicole Diver in F. Scott Fitzgerald's novel ''Tender is the Night''; Sara was the model for Picasso's ''Woman in White,'' and Fitzgerald bestowed the name Honoria on the heroine of his 1931 story ''Babylon Revisited.''         Honoria Adeline Murphy (she pronounced the 'H' in her first name) was born in New York on Dec. 19, 1917. Fair haired and blue eyed, she ''looked like a Renoir and was dressed accordingly,'' in the words of the Murphy biographer Calvin Tomkins.         In 1921, partly to escape the philistinism of American culture, the Murphys sailed for Europe with Honoria and her younger brothers, Baoth and Patrick. In Paris they painted scenery for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes, which gave them entree to a circle that included Picasso and Jean Cocteau.         In the summer of 1925 the family moved to Antibes, on the Riviera, then an unheard-of destination in warm weather. (The Murphys are credited with starting the Riviera's summer season.) They christened their house Villa America.         At Villa America, they moved in a shimmering bubble that seemed to insulate them from ordinary cares. The late 20's passed there in a charmed blur of jazz and Champagne and beaded dresses, of spats and white flannels and sherry and biscuits on the seashore. A representative guest list: Picasso, Fitzgerald, John Dos Passos, Archibald MacLeish, Philip Barry, Robert Benchley, Dorothy Parker, Cole Porter, Monty Woolley, Igor Stravinsky, Fernand Leger and Ernest and consecutive Mrs. Hemingways.         To Honoria and her brothers, these artistic titans were simply the adored tall people of their enchanted childhood. Hemingway taught her to catch and gut fish. (She got off easy: he once tried to teach her father to bullfight.) The photographs in the family album were by Man Ray. Scrutinizing one of Honoria's drawings hung on the Villa America terrace (nicknamed ''Les Salons de Jeunesse''), Picasso counseled, ''Don't change it.''         As a young woman, she studied French theater history with Mrs. Darius Milhaud and acting with Mrs. Patrick Campbell. She later performed with the French Theater of New York and worked as a secretary for Theater Inc., a producing organization. In recent years, she lectured on the Lost Generation writers and opened her vast archive of family memorabilia to scholars of the period.         In 1929 the real world intruded savagely on the Murphys' idyll when their youngest son, Patrick, was found to have tuberculosis. They returned to the United States, where Honoria attended Rosemary Hall School in Greenwich, Conn., and the Spence School in New York, from which she graduated in 1937.         It was Baoth who died first, in 1935, after contracting spinal meningitis at 15. ''Only the invented part of our life -- the unreal part -- has had any scheme, any beauty,'' Gerald Murphy wrote to Fitzgerald. ''Life itself has stepped in now and blundered, scarred and destroyed.''         Two years later Patrick died at 16. Fitzgerald wrote to the Murphys: ''For a long, long time you will be inconsolable. But I can see another generation growing up around Honoria and an eventual peace somewhere.''         A devoted daughter who was ever conscious of her responsibility as the sole surviving child, Honoria fulfilled that prophecy. After an early marriage that ended in divorce, she wed William M. Donnelly, a businessman, in 1950. (On their honeymoon, she telephoned her parents every night.) The couple lived in Carmel, Calif., and later in McLean, Va. Mrs. Donnelly, who was widowed in 1988, is survived by their children, John, of Palm Beach Shores; Sherman, of Key Biscayne, Fla., and Laura, of East Hampton, N.Y., and three grandchildren.         ''How different a dawn than the one we saw in a hospital 18 years ago,'' Gerald Murphy wrote to Sara after the Donnellys' second son was born. ''Two boys went out from our family, and now two other boys have come into it.''       
         If you saw her at all, you'd see her in a cemetery late at night. She'd be clambering about one of those huge cemeteries in Brooklyn and Queens, the ones beneath the flight paths to La Guardia and Kennedy, the ones you can see from certain expressways; the graveyards with comforting names like Evergreen, Mount Neboh and Cypress Hills. She was there on the hottest, stickiest summer night when New Yorkers without air-conditioners couldn't sleep, and she was there when the temperature was below zero and the snow was hip-deep and nobody was awake.         In the moonlight and even when there was no moon, amid the chalk-white and gray polished marble sentries guarding the dead of a great city, Gloria Marie De Martini Stradtner looked only for life in the necropolis.         Mrs. Stradtner, who died on Dec. 22 at the age of 72, looked for stray animals. She looked for the thousands of dogs and cats abandoned every year by people who, having tired of their pets, thought not of bringing them to an animal shelter but of leaving them in a cemetery. Humans may think of cemeteries as woodland-like sanctuaries. But for animals, they are only places to starve to death in the wild.         But Gloria -- as everyone called her -- was determined that this was not to be. Not for her strays.         And so for 50 years or maybe more (nobody can remember when she did not make the rounds of the graveyards at night), she would go forth, lugging large bags of dog food and cat food and big and small traps of the type that cannot hurt animals. She would bait these traps and go back to her car and wait. In an hour or so, she would return to her traps. Sometimes, she would entrap a dozen animals or more in a single night, her prisoners of love. And then she would feed them.         Mrs. Stradtner never had much money, and so to supplement the dog and cat food she bought with her Social Security money she would take jobs working in catering halls, even when she was getting on in years, so she could scoop up the scraps and bring them to her strays in the graveyards. When she was younger, back in the 1950's, she worked as a clerk and data entry specialist for I.B.M. But she did not mind doing menial work in a catering hall. Not if it meant she could feed the animals.         And after she fed them, she would spend the next day making the rounds of veterinarians, imploring their help to neuter the dogs and cats  (they usually charged her reduced fees, which she paid with the money from her modest Social Security check). And then she would visit the shelters, asking them to please take and care for the dogs and cats that New Yorkers did not want.         With her puppies and kittens in tow, she visited shelters outside New York. One was Pegeen Fitzgerald's Last Post Animal Sanctuary all the way up in Litchfield County, Connecticut, near the Massachusetts line. They try to specialize in housing cats there, but when Mrs. Stradtner showed up with dogs from the graveyards of New York, they took in dogs, too.         ''I would estimate she saved thousands of animals,'' said Jeanne Toomey, who runs Last Post. ''She was wonderful. She'd name dogs and cats in the cemetery and she'd bring them up here. Nobody could refuse her.'' She visited animal sanctuaries in Long Island, upstate and in New Jersey, too, and nobody refused her in those places, either.         Sometimes, her friends would go with her on her night visits. Michael Puccino, an executive with a Manhattan computer consulting firm, and his wife, Anne Marie, a veterinary nurse, would help whenever they could. And the cemetery workers helped, too. When it was bitter cold, the workers in at least one cemetery opened the door to a heated mausoleum so the strays could spend the night there. In another cemetery, they built little igloos in the bitterest part of the winter, hoping that Mrs. Stradtner's strays would use them to keep warm.         Mr. Puccino told her more than once that cemeteries are not the safest places to be after dark. But she scoffed at such advice. ''She was the most adventurous, the liveliest individual you'd ever meet,'' Mr. Puccino said. When she was in her 70's, everybody thought she was in her 50's.         Last August, somebody stole her car, which was parked on a Brooklyn street near the house on Chestnut Street where she lived.         ''She called me, and she didn't care about the car,'' Mr. Puccino said. ''She was angry because there were 100 pounds of dog food in the trunk.''         Last summer, there was a dog she was worried about. She called the dog Peekaboo because it peeked around gravestones at her. Peekaboo kept having litters. In one delivery, she had 10 pups. Mrs. Stradtner was determined that Peekaboo be spayed. But Peekaboo was elusive. She would come when Mrs. Stradtner called her name, but no closer than 10 feet. Peekaboo was quite wild, covered with fleas and ticks, and she trusted nobody; life in a cemetery does that to a dog.         One day about six weeks ago, Mrs. Stradtner's speech became slurred. Mr. Puccino spoke to her on the telephone and asked her if she had been drinking. He knew she had not been drinking. She never drank and had not smoked for 20 years.         She stayed with the Puccinos briefly, and Mr. Puccino had her examined at Southside Hospital in Bay Shore. The doctors there said she had cancer. It had started in her lungs and spread to her brain. Then, she moved to Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan; she knew somebody who worked there.         She called Mr. Puccino on Dec. 20, two days before she died. Mr. Puccino said that she wanted to make sure that Peekaboo had been spayed (she was) and that her own two dogs, Lance and Ivy, would be taken care of after she died (he promised her they would be).         The people who knew her and loved her were not sure yesterday about her next of kin. She had been married to a man named Stradtner for three years, maybe 40 years ago. Nobody knew where he was. They had no children. Her sister, Gladys Semino, had predeceased her. Her friends thought, however, that there were cousins.         Somebody found a poem she was believed to have recently written, and at her funeral last Saturday, it was read. It was entitled ''Weep Not'' and began this way:         Do not weep for me when I am gone         For I have friends in the great beyond.         All the little ones I used to feed         Will come to me in my time of need.         They will purr and bark in great delight,         And I will hold and hug them tight.         Oh what a great day that will be         When my furry friends all welcome me.       
         Viola Farber, a founding member of the Merce Cunningham Dance Company, a choreographer and the director of the dance program at Sarah Lawrence College, died on Dec. 24 at Lawrence Hospital in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 67 and lived in Bronxville.         The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, Jeff Slayton, her former husband and longtime dance partner, said.         A tall, long-bodied individualist with uncompromisingly cropped hair long before that was fashionable, Ms. Farber was an unself-conscious study in quiet unpredictability. She moved with a fierce passion and intensity and a gentle lyricism. She could speak with the softness of a shy, reflective child or, in the studio, with the toughness of a drill sergeant. An edge of lazily subversive wit lay beneath her plain-spokenness in conversation and in her dancing.         In the quintessentially Farberesque ''Legacy,'' which she choreographed in 1968 to a Chopin etude, Ms. Farber moved like a dreaming, elegant giraffe, dressed in a flowing shift but wearing a baseball catcher's mitt on one hand. Poetic and mysterious, the solo was not at all Dadaist despite the incongruity and potential humor of the mitt.         ''Her body often had the look of one part being in balance, and the rest extremely off,'' Mr. Cunningham wrote of her in David Vaughan's book ''Merce Cunningham: Fifty Years,'' in a description of Ms. Farber in his 1960 ''Crises,'' created in part for her odd talents. ''Now and again it was like two persons, another just ahead or behind the first. This was coupled with an acute rhythmic sense.''         Born in Heidelberg, Germany, Ms. Farber came to the United States with her family at the age of 7 and became a naturalized citizen six years later. She met Mr. Cunningham and his collaborator John Cage in 1952 at Black Mountain College, where she was studying dance with Katherine Litz and music with Lou Harrison. Ms. Farber joined the Cunningham company in 1953, dancing there through 1965. She created roles in some of Mr. Cunningham's major early works, among them ''Crises,'' ''Rune'' and ''Nocturne.''         During her Cunningham years, she also performed with Litz, playing a vampire in her ''Dracula,'' and with Peter Saul and Paul Taylor. Her last performance was in a 1995 collaborative duet, ''Threestep (Shipwreck),'' which she created with the choreographer Ralph Lemon, a former student, for his company's season at the Joyce Theater.         Ms. Farber formed the Viola Farber Dance Company in 1968, creating most of her choreography for the troupe, which disbanded in 1985. Writing in the International Encyclopedia of Dance, Christopher Caines describes her earliest dances as having a febrile atmosphere and ''a dark, violent intensity that some interpreted as sadomasochistic, despite moments of tenderness.'' By the 1970's, Ms. Farber had mellowed considerably. ''My dances report what I see,'' she told Jack Anderson in a 1978 interview in The New York Times. ''They are my response to the way everything is mixed up together in this world -- people and microbes and elephants and cassowary birds.''         In her 1973 ''Poor Eddie,'' Ms. Farber incorporated the gestures of flight attendants as they demonstrate the use of safety equipment in planes. Her own nervousness about driving in the middle, passing lane on a three-lane highway inspired the creation of another dance, ''Route 6.'' Like Mr. Cunningham, Ms. Farber favored the juxtaposition of disparate kinds of activity in dance, where formal patterns and the combinations of steps often mattered more than the steps themselves.         Ms. Farber was especially popular in France, where she won a gold medal, with Mr. Slayton, in the Ninth International Dance Festival in Paris in 1971. From 1981 to 1983 she was the artistic director of the Centre National de Danse Contemporaine in Angers, establishing, at the same time, an institute for the training of dance teachers in Paris. Ms. Farber returned to the United States in 1988 to take the Sarah Lawrence post, but continued to teach and choreograph in France into the 1990's. She also taught at the London Contemporary Dance School from 1984 to 1987 and, from early in her career, at universities and dance festivals throughout the United States.         The French Government recently named Ms. Farber an Officier de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres in France.         She is survived by two sisters, Elisabeth Lanzl of Chicago and Irene Aikin of Parkdale, Ore.         Correction:  January 6, 1999, Wednesday  An obituary of the dancer and choreographer Viola Farber on Dec. 31 misstated the work and the year in which she last performed. It was in James Cunningham's ''From the Horse's Mouth'' at the Joyce SoHo last April, not in ''Threestep (Shipwreck)'' in 1995.       
         Gyo Fujikawa, a prolific author and illustrator of children's books, including some of the first to feature children of many races, died on Nov. 26 at New York Hospital. She was 90 and lived in Manhattan.         The California-born daughter of a Japanese farmer and an aspiring Japanese social worker, Miss Fujikawa was among the first illustrators to command royalties rather than a flat fee.         Miss Fujikawa's father borrowed her first name from a Chinese emperor (the name rhymes with Leo).         She illustrated five books, including ''Mother Goose'' and ''The Night Before Christmas,'' and wrote and illustrated 45 others. She also designed six United States postage stamps, including the 32-cent yellow rose self-adhesive stamp issued last year and the United States-Japan Treaty centenary stamp of 1960.         Although she retired from writing and illustrating books in 1990, when  her last two books were published, Barnes and Noble booksellers had recently approached her longtime literary agent about reprinting many of the ones that are out of print, said the agent, Bernard Kurman. The first two books she both wrote and illustrated, ''Babies'' and ''Baby Animals,'' have sold a combined 1.3 million copies and are still in print.         ''If you notice,'' Miss Fujikawa wrote a few years ago, ''in all my books (except for the fairy-tale books) there are very few grown-ups. I try to draw children in such a way that they convey the emotion or the action or whatever it is that I'm talking about.''         Born in Berkeley, Calif., in 1908, Miss Fujikawa studied at the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles before and after spending 1932 in Japan, where she developed a love of Japanese art and a stronger appreciation of her heritage. Back home, she did promotional work on the movie ''Fantasia'' for Disney Studios, which later sent her to its advertising department in New York, where she designed many 25-cent Disney books.         After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II, Mrs. Fujikawa's family was interned in Arkansas in a relocation camp.         During the war Miss Fujikawa did movie and pharmaceutical advertising layouts and magazine illustrations.         After she did a composite of Disney characters for McCall's magazine, Doris Dunewald, an editor at Grosset & Dunlap, asked her to illustrate a new edition of Robert Louis Stevenson's ''A Child's Garden of Verses,'' which was published in 1953. A few years later Ms. Dunewald proposed that she write the text as well as illustrate the two books that became ''Babies'' and ''Baby Animals.'' After that Miss Fujikawa was to write and illustrate most of her books, including the last two, ''See What I Can Be!'' (Putnam, 1990) and ''Good Night, Sleep Tight, Shhh. . .'' (Random House, 1990).         Although she was engaged for a few years beginning at the age of 19, Miss Fujikawa never married. In her autobiographical sketch, written in her later years, she said, ''I am flattered when people ask me how I know so much about how children think and feel. Although I have never had children of my own, and cannot say I had a particularly marvelous childhood, perhaps I can say I am still like a child myself. Part of me, I guess, never grew up.''       
         Hazel Bishop, who cooked up the first kissproof lipstick (''stays on you . . . not on him'') in a kitchen fitted out as a laboratory, then lost the right to use the name she made famous, died on Saturday at the Osborn Home in Rye, N.Y. She was 92.         She exploited the skills of a research chemist, a merchant and a teacher to achieve eminence in three careers over the course of 50 years.         It was soon after World War II that Miss Bishop, a trained chemist who had worked in a dermatologist's laboratory, developed a nondrying, nonirritating, long-wearing lipstick. (Long-lasting types contain high amounts of colorants called bromo acids that have staining qualities.)         In 1950, she formed Hazel Bishop Inc. to manufacture and market her discovery. ''Never again need you be embarrassed by smearing friends, children, relatives, husband, sweetheart,'' the early advertising said, pointing out that older formulations tended to leave greasy marks on glasses, cigarettes and teeth. And the new brand did not have to be applied several times a day.         The brand found instant acceptance. When it was introduced that summer at $1 a tube, Lord & Taylor sold out its stock on the first day. The brand soon captured 25 percent of the fast-growing lipstick market and locked horns with Charles Revson of Revlon in ''the lipstick war.''         But Miss Bishop was engaged in a war of her own with her majority stockholder over financial issues. In settling her lawsuit, she left the company in 1954, when its sales exceeded $10 million a year. She set up Hazel Bishop Laboratories to develop household and personal care products, but ran into legal problems with her former partner, losing the right to sell products under her own name or to use it in personal appearances.         In 1962, she became a stockbroker for Bache & Company and later a financial analyst for Evans & Company. With the burgeoning of the fragrance business in the 1960's and 70's, cosmetics companies became hot stocks and her advice was ardently sought. She was quoted in newspaper financial pages and lectured throughout the United States.         Her third career was in fashion education. In 1978, she became an adjunct professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan in a program preparing young people for careers in cosmetics.         In 1980, on the occasion of Miss Bishop's appointment to the Revlon Chair in Cosmetics Marketing at F.I.T., Michel Bergerac, chairman of Revlon, said: ''It is really quite an achievement to carve one outstanding career in a lifetime. To succeed in business, in finance, and in academics in only part of a life is truly an amazing thing.''         Hazel Bishop was born in Hoboken, N.J.. on Aug. 17, 1906, one of two children of Henry and Mabel Bishop. Her father ran a dozen successful enterprises, including numerous stores on Washington Street, the main concourse of Hoboken. One Thanksgiving, he brought Santa Claus to town on an elephant to advertise his candy emporium.         ''The family talk around the dinner table always concerned business,'' Miss Bishop said.         After graduating from Barnard College, Miss Bishop intended to go to medical school, but the stock market crash forced her to take a job as a chemist at Columbia University Medical Center, where she worked for a leading dermatologist, investigating allergies and cosmetics.         In World War II, as senior organic chemist with what is now Exxon, she discovered the cause of deposits affecting superchargers of aircraft engines. After the war, she moved on to what is now Mobil, but in the meantime made her historic discovery.         She is survived by a niece, Randa Bishop of Las Vegas, Nev., and two nephews, Arthur Lipper of Delmar, Calif., and A. Michael Lipper of Summit, N.J.         Described over the years as demure and trim, with hazel eyes and a weakness for hats, the woman who invented kissable lipstick never married. She said she felt the obligation, in her courting years, to keep her widowed mother company at home.         After she left the business, she still mixed up lipstick for herself, a red shade with a blue cast, and once offered the following beauty advice: ''Women should use makeup to accentuate their most attractive feature. After the age of 25 or thereabouts, personality becomes an increasingly more attractive feature.''       
         Dr. Theodora Mead Abel, a psychologist who brought an anthropologist's view to her study of the Indians of New Mexico, died Dec. 2 at her home in Forestburgh, N.Y. She was 99.         Dr. Abel was a leader in cross-cultural psychological research, which became her main focus after retiring from a career largely in family therapy in New York, said Dr. Samuel Roll, a professor of psychology at the University of New Mexico. Dr. Roll collaborated with Dr. Abel in studies of Mexicans and Indians, including the Mescalero and Jicarilla Apaches, the Navajo, and the people of the Laguna, Taos, Santo Domingo and other pueblos in northern New Mexico.         In Albuquerque, Indians of several tribes gave her the title ''grandmother'' as an indication of the respect they held for her.         The key to her success in therapy with Indian patients was her understanding of the importance placed on a balance of life's forces, and she often asked family members to join in the therapy, Dr. Roll said.         At age 98, Dr. Abel received the American Psychological Foundation's 1997 Gold Medal Award for life achievement.         Theodora Abel was born in Newport, R.I., and received her B.A. from Vassar College in 1921, her M.A. from Columbia University in 1924 and her Ph.D. from Columbia in 1925.         While a graduate student, she met and became friends with Margaret Mead while they were lined up alphabetically to take care of paperwork. Though they shared the same last name at the time, they were not related. Decades later, Dr. Mead, by then known worldwide for her work in anthropology, wrote the introduction for Dr. Abel's book ''Culture and Psychotherapy'' (College and University Press, 1975), written with Rhoda Metraux.         Dr. Abel taught at the University of Illinois and at Sarah Lawrence College and later became the director of research at the Manhattan Trade School for Girls. In 1940, she joined Letchworth Village psychiatric center in Rockland County, N.Y.,  as a research psychologist. In 1947, she joined the Postgraduate Center for Mental Health in Manhattan, where she was director of psychoanalysis.         In 1971, she moved to New Mexico and began her work there. When she was 88, she collaborated on a new version of her 1975 book, this time called ''Psychotherapy and Culture'' (University of New Mexico Press, 1987), with Dr. Roll and Ms. Metraux. Also in 1971, she became a clinical professor of psychiatry at the University of New Mexico, and at the university's Child Guidance Center she became chief of family therapy service. She saw patients into her 90's.         Her husband, Theodore Abel, died in 1988. Dr. Abel returned to New York this year.         Survivors include two daughters, Caroline Lalire of Hamilton, Va., and Zita Emerson of Albuquerque; a son, Peter Abel of St. Davids, Pa., 10 grandchildren and 7 great-grandchildren.       
         Flora Roberts, a dynamic play agent who represented many important theater artists, died on Saturday at New York Hospital. She was 77, and lived in Manhattan and Bridgewater, Conn.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said her associate Sarah Douglas.         Stephen Sondheim, Tina Howe, Alfred Uhry, Maury Yeston and others were greatly indebted to Ms. Roberts, who encouraged them to challenge themselves. As she said in an interview earlier this year, ''writers are causes.'' When she believed in someone, she devoted herself wholeheartedly to nurturing the career of that client.         As Mr. Sondheim said, she was ''a protector and an idealist'' who cared more about the work than the contract. She was not known for her power as a negotiator but for her perspicacity in reading scripts and in analyzing a play in production. Andre Bishop, the artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater, said Ms. Roberts had ''a real ability to think like a producer, feel like an artist and act like an agent.''         A perfect personification of her first name, Ms. Roberts gave new meaning to the word flamboyant. She was, Ms. Howe said, ''a woman of enormous style, heart, experience, courage, intelligence -- a real original.'' As round as she was short, and fond of wearing large red hats, Ms. Roberts was one of the most colorful people in the American theater, bursting with energy and with a gravelly voice that approached that of a basso profundo. She was outspoken with her ideas and comments and thought nothing of castigating a client if she felt that a play was worthy of improvement.         Her greatest talent was in her instinctive reaction to fine work, no matter where it came from. As she said, ''Fortunately, I have a finger on the pulse.'' Years ago, Frank Loesser sent her a composer who had written a musical that he considered very noncommercial. She listened to the composer play one song on the piano in her apartment, and it gave her goose bumps. The song was ''Sit Down, John''; the musical was ''1776.'' She recommended that the composer, Sherman Edwards, work with Peter Stone (not her client) as a book writer. Then she guided the show to its Broadway success.         When she received a script of ''The Gin Game,'' she wondered who would want to do ''a two-character play about old people,'' then noticed a photograph on her wall of Hume Cronyn and Jessica Tandy in ''The Four-Poster.'' She called Mr. Cronyn, and, buoyed by his enthusiasm, the play quickly rolled into production. The author, D. L. Coburn, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1977, one of many honors awarded to Ms. Roberts's clients, including Pulitzers for ''The Diary of Anne Frank,'' Mr. Sondheim's ''Sunday in the Park With George'' and ''Driving Miss Daisy,'' a play that she suggested Mr. Uhry write when he was thinking of doing a television mini-series.         She met Mr. Sondheim in the early 1950's when he was working on his first show, ''Saturday Night,'' and he became her longest-running client. From ''West Side Story'' onward, she made creative contributions to his musicals.         Last season, shows that Ms. Roberts represented filled theatrical marquees: Ms. Howe's ''Pride's Crossing,'' the revivals of ''Anne Frank'' and ''1776,'' and, carried over from the previous season, Mr. Uhry's ''Last Night of Ballyhoo'' and the musical ''Titanic.''         Ms. Roberts was born in the Bronx, and studied at the Manhattan School of Music and Hunter College to become an opera singer. At one point she sang for Arturo Toscanini. She remembered that he said, ''Molta musica, but a small voice.'' Eventually, she became something of a diva in real life, and switched from opera to torch songs, which she often sang for friends.         After graduation, she worked as an all-purpose assistant to Kermit Bloomgarden, the producer. One day in the mid-1940's Mr. Bloomgarden gave her a new play to read, Lillian Hellman's ''Another Part of the Forest.'' When the playwright asked what she thought of it, she offered  frank criticism. In response, Ms. Hellman told the producer to give his assistant a raise, adding, ''She's right, and I don't think I can fix it.''         ''I got a raise,'' said Ms. Roberts, ''and she tried to fix it.''         That same year, Arthur Miller submitted a play (later titled ''All My Sons'') to Mr. Bloomgarden and she advised him to produce it. Able to present only one play at a time, he chose Ms. Hellman's instead, but with Ms. Roberts's encouragement, subsequently produced ''Death of a Salesman.''         In the 1950's, because of her interest in playwrights, she became an agent. One of her first clients was Ira Levin, then a television writer. She got him an assignment adapting the Mac Hyman novel ''No Time for Sergeants,'' first for television, then for Broadway, and she discovered the play's star, Andy Griffith.         Although most of her clients were writers, Ms. Roberts also represented a few directors (Susan Stroman) and designers (Jennifer Tipton). Frequently she had solicitations to join major talent agencies, but she remained fiercely independent and placed great emphasis on personal loyalty. As she said: ''I really love most of my clients. That's a privilege when you're on your own.''         She is survived by her sister, Janet Sovin of Berkeley, Calif., and her brother, David, of Huntington Station, N.Y.         Ms. Roberts's major passions were theater and horses. She owned a racehorse, Allaway, and often visited Belmont Park. At the track or on Broadway, she relied upon her experience and her assessment of form and potential. Sometimes she just took a flier and followed her intuition, as when she bet on a horse named ''Comedy Tonight'' because Mr. Sondheim had written a song by that name. Naturally, she bet on the horse to show, and it did. About her other preoccupation, she said, ''I gamble on the theater every day.''
