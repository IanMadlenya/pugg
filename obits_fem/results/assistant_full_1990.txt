        Lilly Dache, the milliner who flourished in this country in the decades when women selected their new hats before they chose their new clothes, died Sunday at a nursing home in Louvecienne, France. She was 97 years old.         Lilly Dache, the milliner who flourished in this country in the decades when women selected their new hats before they chose their new clothes, died Sunday at a nursing home in Louvecienne, France. She was 97 years old.         She was best known for her turbans, which she made by draping the fabric right on her customers' heads.         ''I would talk to the woman, ask her where she planned to wear the hat, what kind of dress she would wear it with,'' she told an interviewer at the end of her career. ''If she thought her nose was too long, I would make a hat with a brim and pull it down so you couldn't see the nose so much. I made everything with love, affection and excitement.''         Customers Included Film Stars         Her clients included Hollywood stars like Sonja Henie, Audrey Hepburn, Carole Lombard and Marlene Dietrich. Her last customer was Loretta Young, who arrived at her studio after Miss Dache decided to retire and bought her last 30 hats.         That was in 1968. Miss Dache's husband, Jean Despres, an executive at Coty Inc., the fragrance and cosmetics house, was retiring and she decided to close her business. Until his death last year, she and her husband divided their time between Delray Beach, Fla., and Meudon, France.         She had come to this country from France at the age of 16 and lived with an uncle in Atlantic City at first. But she soon went to New York, saw a sign in a window on a shop on Broadway saying ''Milliner Wanted'' and got the job.         She and another woman working there eventually bought the shop from the owner. She remembered the first hat she made as her own boss: a turban in four shades of blue, made from scraps lying in the shop.         A Leader in Fashion World         She was part of a group of milliners who were better known at the time than dress designers. They included John-Fredericks, Walter Florell, Laddie Northridge and Sally Victor.         In the 1930's depression era, women with limited funds tended to buy new hats instead of new clothes. In the 1940's clothing fabric was in restricted supply because of World War II, and hats continued in demand because they were showy.         But Miss Dache saw that millinery might not continue in fashion indefinitely, so she developed snoods with flowers, veils and bows as alternatives.         At the end of the 1950's she hired a young assistant from Chicago, Halston Frowick, who went on to become known for his own line of clothes. She also hired Kenneth Battell to take charge of her hair salon. By the 1960's elaborate coiffures by Kenneth, as he was known, swept hats off the fashion map.         Miss Dache did not mourn the end of the millinery era. After her retirement, she rarely wore a hat; she preferred wigs.         She is survived by her daughter, Suzanne Dache-Gould, who also became a milliner, and two grandsons. A funeral service will be held in Meudon on Thursday.

She remained in New York after the chamber was abolished by Secretary of State Henry L. Stimson in 1929 with the oft-quoted aphorism, ''Gentlemen do not read each other's mail.''         In 1940, she joined the Army's Signal Intelligence Service, the organization that again broke Japanese diplomatic codes.         In 1941 she left the Army to rejoin Mr. Yardley in establishing a Canadian coding service. The two were married in 1944.         A first marriage had ended in divorce. Mr. Yardley, considered the father of American crytography, died in 1958. Mrs. Yardley is survived by a sister, Lillian R. Meyer of Whiting, N.J.

She was within two weeks of her 92d birthday.         Helene Pons, a leading costume designer for almost four decades until her retirement in 1965, died of kidney problems yesterday at a private clinic in Rome. She was within two weeks of her 92d birthday.         Mrs. Pons designed and executed the costumes for such shows as ''Our Town,'' ''The Diary of Anne Frank,'' ''Babes in Arms'' and ''The Time of the Cuckoo.'' She also executed the designs for scores of other shows, including ''My Fair Lady,'' ''Camelot,'' ''Kiss Me Kate'' and ''Pal Joey'' and for many productions of the Metropolitan Opera Company, American Ballet Theater and the New York City Ballet.         She once noted that one of her most troublesome stage designs was the slip worn by Barbara Bel Geddes in the original 1955 production of ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.'' The slip was remade several times because ''she had to be decent,'' Mrs. Pons said. ''Yet it had to look just like any ordinary slip you buy in a store,'' she added.         Known for her fractured pronunciation - speaking French with a Russian accent and English with a French accent - she was also, at times, impatient and explosive. She was said to have once screamed at an assistant, in one breath, ''You go to hell and be sure to get back here by 4:30!''         Running a Studio         Mrs. Pons, the former Helene Wermicheff, was born on April 30, 1898, in Tiflis in the Caucasus of Russia. She was educated in Switzerland and in 1920 went to Paris to study art. There she met and married George Pons, technical director of the Chauve Souris, a theater company organized by Soviet emigres.         The company traveled to England and, in 1922, to New York City, where Mrs. Pons and her husband established a studio for the design and execution of stage costumes in 1923. Mrs. Pons was in charge of the designs and Mr. Pons, who died in 1959, took care of the business side of the firm.         ''She has an intuition,'' Mr. Pons once said. ''I have accuracy, but she is an artist.''         Mrs. Pons, who spent the years after her retirement living in New York, California and Rome, entered the Rome clinic in August.         She is survived by a daughter, Giselle Marziale, three grandchildren and four great-grandchildren, all of whom live in Rome. Burial is to take place tomorrow at the Marzione family tomb in Verano Cemetery in Rome.

Mrs. Whaley was born in Baltimore and received bachelor's and master's degrees in social work from Ohio State University.         Long Association With League         In 1953 she became associate executive director of the Columbus (Ohio) Urban League, beginning an association that spanned 37 years.         After serving as director of community development programs at the New York headquarters of the nonpartisan civil-rights organization, Mrs. Whaley was appointed to the Agency for Child Development post.

She was 97 years old and lived in Wellesley, Mass.         Dorothy W. Weeks, a physicist whose professional career spanned nearly six decades, died of a stroke on Monday at Newton Wellesley Hospital in Massachusetts. She was 97 years old and lived in Wellesley, Mass.         From 1930 to 1956, except for two years in World War II, Dr. Weeks was a professor and head of the physics department at Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pa. For six years after her retirement from Wilson she coordinated a program at the United States Army's arsenal at Watertown, Mass., that developed radiological shielding materials for use against nuclear weapons, neutrons and gamma rays.         Leaving the Army's Materials Research Agency in 1964, she became a spectroscopist, studying solar satellites at the Harvard College Observatory. She retired in 1976 at the age of 83.         Dr. Weeks, a native of Philadelphia and a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Wellesley College, went to work in 1917 as an assistant examiner for the United States Patent Office and, concurrently, an assistant at the National Bureau of Standards. From 1920 to 1924, while studying and teaching physics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, she earned her master's degree.         In 1924 she began a new, if short-lived, career in retailing. Obtaining a second master's degree, from the Prince School of Business at Simmons College, she became an employment supervisor for Jordan Marsh, the Boston department store.         In 1928 she returned to academic life, teaching physics at Wellesley while earning her Ph.D. in mathematics at M.I.T. in 1930.

        Lois Moran Young, a star of Hollywood's silent films and Broadway musicals who began charming audiences as a dancer at the Paris Opera at the age of 13, died Friday at the Kachina Point Health Center, a nursing home in Sedona, Ariz., near Flagstaff. She was 81 years old and lived in Sedona.         Lois Moran Young, a star of Hollywood's silent films and Broadway musicals who began charming audiences as a dancer at the Paris Opera at the age of 13, died Friday at the Kachina Point Health Center, a nursing home in Sedona, Ariz., near Flagstaff. She was 81 years old and lived in Sedona.         She had been suffering from cancer, said her son, Timothy.         Known as Lois Moran throughout her career, she made her first film, in France, at the age of 14 and gained fame the next year when she starred with Ronald Colman in Samuel Goldwyn's ''Stella Dallas.''         In her film career of more than two dozen movies, Miss Moran combined an artist's versatility with romantic appeal. F. Scott Fitzgerald was said to have based the character Rosemary on her when he wrote ''Tender Is the Night.''         By the age of 20, she had already made four movies for Fox Studios, where she was under long-term contract. But she played leading roles for other studios as well, among them parts in ''Padlocked,'' ''Reckless Lady,'' ''The Road to Mandalay,'' ''Don't Marry,'' ''Mammy'' and ''The Men in Her Life.''         In the early 1930's, after studying singing, she moved to musicals, making her Broadway debut in ''This Is New York.'' She was the leading woman in George Kaufman's satire ''Of Thee I Sing'' and also starred for four years in ''Let 'Em Eat Cake.''         But in 1935, after marrying Col. Clarence M. Young, an Assistant Secretary of Commerce, Miss Moran slowed the pace of her career. She retired permanently in 1954 after co-starring with Robert Preston in the television series ''Waterfront.''         Miss Moran was born in Pittsburgh but, while still an infant, moved to Paris with her mother, a physician's widow. There she joined the Paris Opera Corps de Ballet, where she was spotted by a director who cast her in a movie.         She returned to the United States and starred as Belle Bennett's daughter in ''Stella Dallas.'' After that film's success, the offers poured in. She did one or two films at each of the major studios before signing her long-term contract with Fox.         For some time after her retirement, she and her husband lived and traveled throughout the country. But when Mr. Young retired as a vice president of Pan American World Airways more than 20 years ago, the couple moved permanently to Sedona.         Miss Moran's only immediate survivor is her son, who lives in Sedona.       
        Bess Goodykoontz, an educator who served as Assistant United States Commissioner of Education in the 1930's and 40's, died Sunday at her daughter's home in South Newfane, Vt. She was 95 years old.         Bess Goodykoontz, an educator who served as Assistant United States Commissioner of Education in the 1930's and 40's, died Sunday at her daughter's home in South Newfane, Vt. She was 95 years old.         She died of congestive heart failure, a family spokesman said.         A graduate of the University of Iowa, Dr. Goodykoontz taught at rural schools in Iowa and Wisconsin and at the University of Pittsburgh before being appointed to the No. 2 position in the Bureau of Education, as it was known. She served as Assistant Commissioner from 1929 to 1946, was director of the elementary education division from 1946 to 1949 and was then named Associate Commissioner of Education. In 1951 she became director of comparative education. She was later in charge of international education relations.         Saw Use for 'Talkies'         Dr. Goodykoontz was with the Office of Education, a precursor to a Cabinet department, in the crisis brought on by the Great Depression and later by World War II. In 1932 she advocated use of ''talkies'' in the classroom, writing, ''The sound film appears to be a particularly effective method of instruction for backward children.''         In 1935 she called for an increase in education programs for people mired in the Depression, and early in World War II she advocated day care so mothers could work in arms plants.         She was a member and official of many education organizations and was vice president of the United States National Committee for Childhood Education and of the World Organization for Childhood Education.         She is survived by a daughter, Ellen Darrow of South Newfane, and three grandchildren.       
        Pearl Bailey was remembered at her funeral today as an extraordinary entertainer and a woman who loved life and everyone she met.         Pearl Bailey was remembered at her funeral today as an extraordinary entertainer and a woman who loved life and everyone she met.         ''Pearl was love, pure and simple love,'' Cab Calloway said. ''I mean it from my heart and soul, that Pearl Bailey was something you'll never see again.'' Mr. Calloway, who was a pallbearer, co-starred with Miss Bailey in the all-black production of ''Hello, Dolly!,'' which brought her a Tony Award.         About 2,000 people filled the Deliverance Evangelistic Church while scores waited outside in cool, overcast weather. The singer was dressed in blue and adorned with a string of pearls. She had a red rose in her hand.         Flowers from Lena Horne and Ella Fitzgerald were among those displayed in the church, but for the most part the mourners were friends, family and ordinary people.         Miss Bailey, who spent much of her childhood in Philadelphia, died here las Friday at the age of 72, apparently of a heart attack.         The funeral service consisted of hymns, poetry and fond recollections.         'Plain and Simple'         ''If you knew Miss Bailey, she would like it to be plain and simple, not a lot of fanfare,'' the Rev. Timothy Jones, assistant pastor at the church, told the gathering.         ''She loved everybody,'' said her husband of 38 years, jazz drummer Louis Bellson Jr. ''I have a feeling if she knew we were making all this fuss, she'd say, 'Louie, What are you doing?'         ''They will remember her as a great entertaineer. She was a person of love. She believed 'show business' was 'show love.' ''         Rabbi Harold S. White, a lecturer at Georgetown University where Miss Bailey earned a degree in theology, said she ''craved privacy with her beloved Louie.''         ''She said of herself, 'What you see is what you get,' '' he continued. ''She chided name-droppers.''         After the service, Miss Bailey was buried at Rolling Green Memorial Park in nearby West Chester, where her mother and brother are buried.         Miss Bailey, who lived in Lake Havasu City, Ariz., collapsed in her hotel room, where she was recovering from knee surgery. Doctors said the surgery apparently was not a factor.       
        Blossom Heller, a justice of the New York State Supreme Court, died on Friday at her home in Brooklyn.         Justice Heller was elected to the State Supreme Court in the 2nd Judicial Department, which covers Brooklyn and Staten Island, in 1982. Before that, she served as a judge in the Family Court and in the Criminal Courts of New York City.         A graduate of Brooklyn Law School, she was in private practice from 1957 to 1961, when she was appointed as an assistant district attorney in Brooklyn, a position she held until 1974. She served for two years as a law secretary before being appointed by Mayor Abraham D. Beame to the Family Court in 1976.         She is survived by a brother, Jay, of Brooklyn.       
        Helen Hammett Owen, a retired New York librarian, died on Aug. 26 at her home in Friendship, Me. She was 88 years old.         Mrs. Owen died of congestive heart failure, her son, Wadsworth, said.         Mrs. Owen was an assistant supervisor for the New York Public Library from 1923 to 1930. She was a colleague of Ann Carrol Moore, the founder of the New York Children's Library System, and was a regular contributor to The New York Herald Tribune's children's book column started by Mrs. Moore. Mrs. Owen also worked with the Firehouse Children's Library Program in Harlem and the Bronx.         In 1948, Mrs. Owen moved to Old Greenwich, Conn., and worked for the Greenwich Library. She retired in 1961.         In addition to her son, of Lewes, Del., she is survived by four grandchildren and three great grand-children.

Dr. Jane Bennett Ross, an anthropologist, died on Oct. 11 at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 44 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of breast cancer, said her sister Judy Bennett of San Francisco.         Dr. Ross, who earned a Ph.D. at Columbia University, was a teaching assistant with Margaret Mead from 1969 to 1972. She studied primitive warfare among the Achuara Jivaro Indians in northwestern Peru for two years. Her research on human aggression is the subject of a new book, ''The Balance of Deaths'' (University of Arizona Press).         She had also taught at Brooklyn and Mount Holyoke Colleges and Fordham and New York Universities.         Also surviving are her parents, Warren and Mary Bennett of Sarasota, Fla., and another sister, Anne Tremaine of Oakland, Calif.       
         Claudia Stern, a writer and editor, died yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 46 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of congestive heart failure, a family spokesman said.         Ms. Stern was a story editor and assistant producer for Edgar Sherrick and Sue Pollack, Manhattan film and television producers, from 1978 to 1980.         She collaborated with Charlotte Ford on "Modern Manners," published in 1980 by Simon & Shuster. She also worked with Ms. Ford and her sister Anne on "How to Love the Car in Your Life" (Ford Motor Company, 1972).         She is survived by her mother, Elsie Stern of Manhattan; a daughter, Abigail Rebecca Sims, also of Manhattan; and a brother, John Stern of Cape Neddick, Me.         Her companion was Bennett Byron Sims.       
         Bettina Warburg Grimson, a retired psychiatrist, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90 years old.         She died of pneumonia, a spokeswoman for the family said.         Dr. Grimson, who used her maiden name in her work, was in private practice from 1932 until 1967, when she retired.         From 1965 to 1967, she was a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. She taught at the center's Payne Whitney Psychiatric Clinic from 1932 to 1940.         She graduated from Bryn Mawr College, the Cornell Medical School and the New York Psychoanalytic Institute.         Her husband, Samuel B. Grimson, a musician, died in 1955. There are no immediate survivors.       
         Hortense W. Gabel, a former New York State Supreme Court justice who was a longtime advocate for housing and civil rights and whose career was shattered when she was accused in the Bess Myerson case, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 77 years old.         She died of heart failure, her daughter, Sukhreet, said.         Mrs. Gabel served on the Civil Court and State Supreme Court for 17 years. In December 1988 she was acquitted of charges that she had abused her powers by improperly reducing the alimony payments of Ms. Myerson's companion, Carl A. Capasso, in exchange for a job for her daughter in the city's Department of Cultural Affairs, which Ms. Myerson headed.         Mrs. Gabel had a long and distinguished career in government before assuming the Civil Court bench in 1970. That career began after Mrs. Gabel, already active as a reform Democrat, attended a dinner party in 1948 given by Rabbi Stephen S. Wise, the founder of the American Jewish Congress; discussion at the party centered on the formation of a group that would champion the cause of blacks discriminated against in housing.  Enforced Rent Laws         By the mid-1950's, as a director of the Committee on Discrimination in Housing, she was involved in trying to expose abuses in the urban renewal program in New York City and helped draft a report that was highly critical of Robert Moses, the builder who reshaped much of the city.         As head of New York City's Rent and Rehabilitation Administration, she dreamed of a slumless New York, and her enforcement of the rent-control laws uncovered overcharges and conspiracies, saving tenants millions of dollars. She also developed rehabilitation programs for sections of Harlem, the Lower East Side and Brooklyn.         Later, as a consultant to and vice president of the Center for Community Change, Mrs. Gabel helped develop housing programs in cities and states across the country.         In her several decades of public service, she served as an assistant New York City corporation counsel, general counsel and first deputy administrator of the New York State Temporary Housing Rent Commission and assistant to the mayor for housing and New York City Rent and Rehabilitation Commissioner, a position she held from 1962 to 1965. Mrs. Gabel was also a consultant to the Federal Housing and Home Finance Agency and to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.         She served as an acting justice of the State Supreme Court in 1973 and as an acting Family Court judge in 1974. She was appointed to fill a vacancy on the State Supreme Court by Gov. Hugh L. Carey in 1975. She was known as a compassionate judge who supported civil rights and women's causes. In 1986, she was named judge of the year by the National Association of Women Judges, an organization she helped found in 1979.         The organization's president, Justice Christine Durham of the Utah Supreme Court, said in a 1987 interview that Justice Gabel was revered as "one of the grand dames of the New York legal community, who has been a mentor and supporter of women in the profession for decades."         Justice Gabel resigned in 1987 under the cloud of criminal and misconduct investigations that led to the Myerson indictments.         A jury in Federal District Court in Manhattan found Mrs. Gabel, Ms. Myerson and Mr. Capasso not guilty of charges of conspiracy, fraud and bribery. The central issue in the case was whether Mrs. Gabel, who was the judge handling preliminary motions in Mr. Capasso's divorce case in 1983, had received a bribe from Ms. Myerson, then New York City's Cultural Affairs Commissioner, in the form of a job for Sukhreet Gabel as a special assistant to Ms. Myerson.         The hiring, the prosecution said, was an inducement to reduce Mr. Capasso's weekly support payments to his wife to $500 from $1,500. Mrs. Gabel had been seeking a job for her daughter. Family Drama         The case was full of bizarre twists and personal dramas. The two-month trial was dominated by the nine days of testimony against her mother by Sukhreet Gabel, the prosecution's star witness, who also taped two telephone conversations with her mother without her knowledge and provided prosecutors with some of her mother's documents.         Mrs. Gabel and her husband, Dr. Milton Gabel, were portrayed during the trial as the protective parents of a troubled woman, and seemed torn between wanting to support her in her moment in the spotlight and hoping that her testimony would not sway the jury.         After the verdict, an exuberant Mrs. Gabel held hands with her daughter outside the courthouse and shouted, "Hooray, we won!"         "This is the best judicial experience I have ever had," she said.         Hortense Wittstein Gabel, known as Horty to her friends, was born Dec. 16, 1912, in the Bronx. She attended public schools in the city and graduated from Hunter College in 1934. Three years later she graduated from Columbia University Law School and worked in her father's law firm. She left in 1944 to marry Dr. Gabel, then an army dentist, and in the war years was a reporter at Fort Hood, Tex., before returning to New York.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a sister, Sybil Phillips. They both live in Manhattan. Dr. Gabel died in July.       
         Marjorie Montrose Christiansen, a college administrator, died on Friday at Springmoor Health Center in Raleigh, N.C. She was 65 years old and lived in Chapel Hill, N.C.         She died of cancer of the lung and brain, her husband, Elliot, said.         Mrs. Christiansen served as acting dean of studies at Fordham from 1968 to 1971 after being assistant to the dean of students at Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville, N.Y. She was director of the University of North Carolina's fellows program for eight years before retiring in 1988. She was a past president of the National Association of Women Deans and Counselors.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a sister, Jean Kullander of Savannah, Ga; two daughters, Catherine Hollenberg of Clarks Summit, Pa., and Laura Morse of Wellesley, Mass, and three grandchildren.       
         Carolyn Prentice Falise, a retired securities analyst, died on Sunday at New York Hospital. She was 57 years old and lived in Manhattan.         She died of lung cancer, said a daughter, Katherine Knapp of Stamford, Conn.         Mrs. Falise retired as an assistant vice president at the Bank of New York in 1984 because of ill health. Earlier she had worked as a securities analyst at Kidder Peabody & Company and as a stockbroker at Laird, Bissell & Meeds.         She was a graduate of Smith College and did graduate work in business administration at Baruch College of the City University of New York.         She is survived by another daughter, Christina Sumner Knapp of Manhattan; her stepmother, Janet McNeir Prentice of Belleair, Fla., and a sister, Barbara Kulesh of Pendleton, S.C.         Correction:  December 19, 1990, Wednesday         An obituary yesterday about Carolyn Prentice Falise, a retired securities analyst, misidentified a surviving daughter. She is Christina SumnerFalise of Manhattan.       
         Janet Chusmir, executive editor of The Miami Herald and a leading proponent of women's advancement to the top levels of management in American journalism, died yesterday at St. Francis Hospital in Miami. She was 60 years old.         The Herald said Ms. Chusmir suffered a brain aneurysm on Friday night, aboutan hour after returning to her home in Miami Beach after the paper's evening news conference at her office.         We have lost a great friend and a great editor," said The Herald's publisher, David Lawrence. "What a zest she had for good newspapers; what energy she had for caring, for worrying about what was right and fair for everyone."         In Ms. Chusmir's three-year tenure as executive editor, The Herald won two Pulitzer Prizes. And in November 1988, less than a year after she was appointed to the paper's top news post, The Herald introduced an enlarged and revamped Spanish-language newspaper, with a separate staff, called El Nuevo Herald. A month ago she was named Editor of the Year by the National Press Foundation, which cited her for "transforming The Herald to serve the unique multicultural population of greater Miami."         When Ms. Chusmir was named The Herald's executive editor in December 1987, about 85 percent of the newsroom executives in the country were men, according to a survey by the American Society of Newspaper Editors. Of the society's 1,000 members -- the top editors of the nation's dailies -- about 80 were women. Opposed Special Position         The dearth of women in high positions was the subject of a seminar at the society's convention in 1988. And when an editor suggested that it was desirable for newspapers to create a "woman's seat" among their top editors, Ms. Chusmir denounced the idea. "The seat becomes devalued," she said, "and the function becomes devalued."         Ms. Chusmir was a feminist who understood the potency of understatement. She recently told a group of Hispanic women: "Pick your battles. It's not good to be fighting over each little thing and male chauvinistic action. Instead, fight for the important things: equal pay and equal respect. Fight smart."         At the same time, she was fond of telling female executives not to forsake their ability to nurture. "I always remind myself that I can't hug a newspaper," she said.         Janet Zoll was born in Boston and earned a journalism degree from Boston University in 1949. A week after graduation she married the editor of her college newspaper, Leonard Chusmir, and soon became a mother and homemaker.         It was not until after moving to Miami Beach with her two school-age children in 1963 that Ms. Chusmir took a job at the Miami Beach Daily Sun, which no longer operates, writing articles at a flat rate of $2.50 each. She was soon given a full-time position. Five Years in Colorado         In 1968, The Herald hired her as a general assignment reporter, and, soon afterward, she was writing a column and receiving awards for her feature writing. In the early 1970's, Ms. Chusmir was named editor of The Herald section News For and About Women, which in her tenure was renamed Living Today. By 1977, she had been promoted to assistant managing editor for features.         Then, in 1982, Knight-Ridder Newspapers, the Herald's corporate parent, appointed her president and publisher of The Daily Camera in Boulder, Colo., making her the first female chief executive of one of the organization's newspapers. Five years later, she returned to The Herald as executive editor.         Last year, in an occasional column she wrote, "View From the Newsroom," Ms. Chusmir offered readers a personal glance at herself. She said her favorite avocations were "baking, reading, swimming, dieting." Her favorite place was "my balcony at sunset." And of journalism, she said, "It's a sacred trust."         Besides her husband, Ms. Chusmir is survived by a son, Steven, of Fort Lauderdale; a daughter, Marsha Chusmir-Shapiro of Daytona Beach, and a grandson.       
         Renee Furst, a publicity agent known for her work on behalf of foreign and independent films, died last Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 62 years old.         She died of cancer, said Norman Wang, her assistant.         Among the many films she represented were "Last Year at Marienbad" (1960), "La Dolce Vita" (1960), "Cousin, Cousine" (1975), "Madame Rosa" (1978), "Missing" (1980), "Fanny and Alexander" (1983), "Rumble Fish" (1983) and "The Official Story" (1985).         In the late 1970's, she publicized most of the Australian new wave films, including "Breaker Morant." She also was the press contact for the Berlin International Film Festival. Recently she became a member of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.         Surviving are her husband, Peter; her stepson, Peter A., of San Francisco, and her sister, Sheila Saunders, of Manhattan.       
         Toni Greenberg, a philanthropist and arts administrator, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 65 years old.         She died of cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Greenberg was president of New York Pro Musica and was the widow of Noah Greenberg, founder and musical director of the early-music ensemble, who died in 1966. She served as assistant to the president of the Mannes College of Music from 1966 to 1970 and was acting director of the New York University Institute for the Humanities in the late 1970's.         She was born in Danzig, then a free city on the Baltic and now Gdansk, Poland, and received a bachelor's degree from New York University and a master's degree in library science from Columbia.         Long interested in the study of Judaism, she made gifts for that purpose to several institutions, including Hebrew University in Jerusalem, of which she was a governor; the New York Public Library, Yale and Skidmore College, where she was a trustee.         She is survived by two daughters, Anne Donovan of London and Jane Ernst of Saratoga Springs, N.Y., and four grandsons.
