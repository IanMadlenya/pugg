She died of heart failure, said James Morgan, a former manager of the Boston company and a close associate.
In 1990, 32 years after its founding, facing debt and disarray, the Opera Company of Boston went out of business.
But in its glory years, Ms. Caldwell's company was a model of bold, imaginative programming, offering musically insightful productions with distinguished casts.
''
        Her company seldom presented more than four productions a season.
Ms. Caldwell's longest period of success came in the 1970's, when the company was thriving and her visibility as a conductor was growing.
The opera was ''La Traviata,'' starring Ms. Sills, who had cajoled the company into engaging Ms. Caldwell.
As a company director, Ms. Caldwell was notoriously disorganized and loath to delegate authority.
''
        Ms. Caldwell faced formidable obstacles in running her company.
Financial support from the Boston civic and cultural worlds was inconsistent, and the company lacked an adequate theater.

In 1978, the company bought the B. F. Keith Memorial Theater on Washington Street in downtown Boston, and it finally had a home -- a run-down but potentially excellent 2,500-seat theater with good acoustics and palatial lobbies.

She started her own company, initially called the Opera Group, in 1958 with just $5,000 in seed money.
By 1965, renamed the Opera Company of Boston, it had won an important place in American opera.
But her assumption of both the director and conductor roles in her productions cost the company time and money.
A year later, facing protests at home from human-rights groups and outraged company patrons, Ms. Caldwell pulled out of the deal.
Ms. Caldwell never gave up hope that she could raise funds and re-start her company.
