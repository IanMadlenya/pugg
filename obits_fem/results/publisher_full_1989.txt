She was 57 years old.         Margot Zemach, an award-winning children's book illustrator and author whose witty, lively works reinterpreted folk tales for younger readers, died of Lou Gehrig's disease Sunday at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 57 years old.         Ms. Zemach was the illustrator or author of more than 40 children's books, including ''Duffy and the Devil,'' ''The Judge,'' ''A Penny a Look,'' ''Salt'' ''Mommy, Buy Me a China Doll,'' ''It Could Always Be Worse'' and ''To Hilda for Helping.''         ''Margot not only revivified the American picture book, but was one of the very few who helped elevate it to an art form,'' said Maurice Sendak, the children's book author and illustrator. ''She was one of the most accomplished picture-book artists on the international scene - a superlative draftsman, a shrewd psychologist and most important, a passionate, tragicomic original.'' Won the Caldecott Medal         ''I consider her the consummate illustrator for children's literature,'' said William Steig, the childrens' book author and illustrator, and a magazine artist for The New Yorker. ''There's no doubt her work will endure.''         In 1974, for ''Duffy and the Devil,'' Ms. Zemach won the Caldecott Medal, the most prestigious American award for children's book illustration, sponsored by the American Library Association. She was twice selected as the American nominee for the Hans Christian Andersen Medal for illustration, the most prestigious international children's book award.         Ms. Zemach was born Nov. 30, 1931 in Los Angeles, and studied at the Los Angeles County Art Institute. She won a Fulbright Scholarship to study drawing in Vienna in 1955. Collaborated With Her Husband         In 1957, she and another Fulbright student, Harvey Fischtrom, were married and began a children's-book collaboration that was to last until her husband's death in 1974.         Their first book, ''Small Boy Is Listening,'' published under the double byline of Margot and Harve Zemach appeared in 1959. She did the drawings and he wrote the text.         At the time of her death Ms. Zemach was working on a picture book of ''Mother Goose'' nursery rhymes. Her principal publisher, Farrar, Straus & Giroux, plans to issue it in 1990.         She is survived by her stepfather, Benjamin; a sister, Amielle; four daughters, Heidi, Rachel, Rebecca and Kaethe Zemach-Bersin, and two granddaughters.

        Mitzi E. Newhouse, who donated $1 million in 1973 to make possible the continued operation of the two theaters in the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, died yesterday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 87 years old.         Mitzi E. Newhouse, who donated $1 million in 1973 to make possible the continued operation of the two theaters in the Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, died yesterday at her home in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 87 years old.         The theaters had come upon hard financial times before Mrs. Newhouse made her gift, and in gratitude for her largesse, Joseph Papp, whose New York Shakespeare Festival was then the theater constituent of Lincoln Center, announced that the Forum Theater would be renamed the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater.         Mrs. Newhouse was the widow of Samuel I. Newhouse, the publisher who built an empire that included more than 30 newspapers, the Conde Nast group of magazines, Random House books and several radio stations and cable-television systems. Abiding Interest in Fashion         Mrs. Newhouse, diminutive and animated, was known as one of the most fashionably dressed women in the world.         In 1959, Mr. Newhouse bought the Conde Nast group of magazines, which included Vogue, Glamour, Mademoiselle, Bride's, Self and House & Garden. The magazine group now also publishes The New Yorker, Vanity Fair and Conde Nast Traveler.         Mr. Newhouse, who died in 1979, described the acquisition of the magazine group that devoted so much coverage to the fashion world as ''an anniversary present for my wonderful wife, Mitzi.'' The remark was interpreted as being only half in jest, but Mrs. Newhouse said she was ''particularly delighted to have Vogue in the family.'' Studied at Parsons School         Mrs. Newhouse, who stood 5 feet tall - only 3 inches shorter than her husband - was the former Mitzi Epstein. She was a student at the Parsons School of Design when they met, and they were married on May 8, 1924.         Throughout her life, Mrs. Newhouse cut a stylish figure in New York and Palm Beach with her designer clothes. Her favorite couturiers were Givenchy and Dior. Although her husband was not noted for gregariousness, Mrs. Newhouse managed to involve him in her world of society and high fashion, and they were inveterate first-nighters at New York theaters.         Mrs. Newhouse presided over several homes, including the couple's 12-room duplex apartment on Park Avenue and their weekend retreat, Greenlands, a rambling early-American farmhouse in Harbourton, N.J.         She is survived by her two sons, S. I. Newhouse Jr. and Donald E. Newhouse, both of New York City; a brother, Walter Evans of St. Louis; six grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.

        Dorothy Schiff, owner of The New York Post for 37 years, died early yesterday in her apartment on the East Side of Manhattan. She was 86 years old.         Dorothy Schiff, owner of The New York Post for 37 years, died early yesterday in her apartment on the East Side of Manhattan. She was 86 years old.         The Post's vice president for editorial and administration, Peter Faris, said she had died of cancer. Members of the Post staff said Mrs. Schiff had learned in May that she had cancer and had decided against being treated for it.         Mrs. Schiff, the granddaughter of a wealthy investment banker, used her family money to obtain the controlling stock of The Post in 1939. She sold it in 1976 to Rupert Murdoch, who sold it in 1988 to Peter S. Kalikow.         Under her stewardship, the newspaper alternately made and lost money, and Mrs. Schiff constantly fretted that it would drive her into pauperdom. But she always managed to keep the newspaper afloat, seeing it outlast its competitors to become the only afternoon daily in New York City. She said in 1987 that she decided to sell the paper to Rupert Murdoch, the Australian entrepreneur, after The Post incurred heavy losses in the mid-1970's. Weak Competitor in '39         Mrs. Schiff bought a controlling interest in The Post in 1939 from J. David Stern at the urging of her second husband, George Backer. She had little business experience, and she later learned that she had assumed obligations for millions of dollars in severance pay if the paper closed.         Mrs. Schiff played only a peripheral role in the management of The Post in the first 10 years of her ownership. When she took active control, her new editor, James A. Wechsler, said the odds of its surviving were 1,000 to 1. Few would have challenged him. The Post was a weak third in the field of New York City afternoon dailies, behind The Journal-American and The World-Telegram, and it had been losing money for 20 years.         But the Post survived and prospered, becoming a liberal power in journalism while its powerful competitors collapsed, one by one. Even her critics agreed that most of the credit had to go to Mrs. Schiff. But they also said her success was partly attributable to personality traits for which they criticized her and to which she freely confessed: a fondness for gossip and scandal, a fear of becoming poor and a craving for power or, as she called it, influence. 'Men, Money & Magic'         Mrs. Schiff resumed her maiden name after her third divorce but decided that ''Mrs.'' was more appropriate than ''Miss'' for a grandmother. She described her private life in her diaries and other papers and in interviews. The book, ''Men, Money & Magic: The Story of Dorothy Schiff,'' by Jeffrey Potter, was published by Coward, McCann & Geoghegan in 1976.         Much of the book is devoted to her relationships with her husbands and male friends, including President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who persuaded her to build a home near his in Hyde Park, N.Y. Her biography suggested that their relationship had included sex and that it had been approved by Mr. Backer.         Mrs. Schiff came to regret what she called ''that awful book.'' In a statement volunteered for this obituary, she said, ''I want to make it very clear that President Roosevelt never made a suggestion that I become his girlfriend, and Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt was just as good a friend as Mr. Roosevelt.'' Born on Fifth Avenue         Mrs. Schiff was born on March 11, 1903, in the Fifth Avenue apartment of her parents, Mortimer L. and Adele Neustadt Schiff. The apartment was a wedding gift from her grandfather, Jacob H. Schiff, a stern banker and the head of Kuhn, Loeb & Company.         As a girl, Dorothy - known to many as Dolly - was often treated coldly by her parents, each of whom had separate romantic and social interests. ''There was no joy in my growing up,'' she recalled. ''None, absolutely none.''         Later she would explain her refusal to grant bonuses or congratulations to Post staff members for good work by saying, ''They weren't given to me as a child, and any words I did receive were not ones of praise.''         She was, by her account, a bookish and sullen girl, associating solely with other young socialites at the Brearley School, Class of '20, on the Upper East Side. After her freshman year at Bryn Mawr College, where, she said, ''I flunked every single course, which is pretty hard to do,'' she set her heart on Richard B. W. Hall, a handsome socialite, though lacking in great wealth. Her parents opposed the match and, in classic fashion, sent her to Europe. But they finally yielded, in 1923. 'Rich at Last!'         Two children, Mortimer and Adele, were born in the first two years, but the marriage quickly turned cold.         After Mrs. Schiff's parents died in 1931, she said, she told her husband: ''My God, I'm rich at last! . . . And now I'm going to leave you.''         Mrs. Schiff said Mr. Hall had resented her Jewish origins as a social handicap. Shedding him, she abandoned a formal conversion to the Episcopal Church and gradually reverted to an old family concern for the fate of European Jewry.         She married Mr. Backer in 1932, because, Mrs. Schiff said, ''In those days, I thought it was important to be married, and since the substantial older ones had enough sense not to marry me, there wasn't much choice.'' Glamour and Politics         Until then, she had been, by her account, a socialite and a nominal Republican, interested chiefly in the glamour of the international set. He was a writer and a liberal Democrat, and he introduced her to the Algonquin Round Table and New Deal politics.         She joined the Roosevelt campaign in 1936 in a minor role and became active in welfare work. Three years later she gained control of The Post, ''with the understanding that I would pay the debts and the deficits,'' she said in 1987.         Mr. Backer became the nominal publisher and editor, and his wife was vice president and treasurer. She lost nearly $2 million the first two years as costs rose and circulation fell, to 190,000 from 250,000. Mrs. Schiff became terrified that the paper would bankrupt her.         She decided it needed a popular approach - a tabloid form, more comics and columns, and plenty of glamour, scandal and human-interest articles.         The features editor, Ted Thackrey, agreed. Mr. Backer did not. Marrying the Editor         Mrs. Schiff took over as publisher in 1942, separated from Mr. Backer and named Mr. Thackrey editor.         The publisher married the editor the next year, and while she was involved in buying radio and television stations, which were eventually sold, The Post under Mr. Thackrey was building circulation and cutting its losses.         The couple diverged on politics, and they publicized their disagreements in a series of columns during the 1948 Presidential campaign, he supporting the Progressive Party candidate, Henry A. Wallace, and she the Republican, Thomas E. Dewey. Both disliked Harry S. Truman, who won.         The Thackreys were divorced the next year. The Golden Age         To many readers and former Post staff writers, the era of James Wechsler's editorship, 1948 to 1961, was the newspaper's golden age. Talented reporters and columnists were hired, and although many features were about sex and celebrities, the paper also took on targets previously immune to critical coverage, like J. Edgar Hoover, Sen. Joseph R. McCarthy and Robert Moses.         From 1950 on, The Post was a money maker almost without interruption. But Mrs. Schiff never lost her sense of financial insecurity. She kept a tight rein on costs, gradually eliminating foreign and out-of-town coverage and permitting many skilled employees to leave for jobs that paid better.         She also kept a close watch on policy, conferring daily with department chiefs. Her decision in 1961 to name Paul Sann editor, making Mr. Wechsler the editorial page chief and a columnist, was generally perceived as favoring human interest over crusading.         As a publisher, she joined the strike-lockout that closed the daily newspapers in New York for 114 days beginning in December 1962. One month before the labor stoppage ended, she resumed publication because, she said, she had been snubbed in the negotiations by her male fellow publishers and because she feared that the continued stoppage might cause the death of weaker papers like The Post. Competition Dwindles         In fact, by 1966 The Daily Mirror had folded, and the morning New York Herald Tribune had merged with the big evening papers into The World Journal Tribune, familiarly dubbed The Widget.         ''I was petrified,'' Mrs. Schiff recalled. ''Here we had Jock Whitney, William Randolph Hearst Jr. and Jack Howard teaming up in the evening field.''         But an executive of the former Herald Tribune, Walter N. Thayer, reassured her, saying, ''It's an impossible three-headed thing.'' He was right. The paper closed a little more than a year later.         Mrs. Schiff then had the evening field to herself. She moved The Post from West Street to The Journal-American plant on South Street. She installed automated equipment and a spacious sixth-floor oval office for herself. The Sale to Murdoch         In December 1976, Mrs. Schiff startled the public and her staff by announcing the sale of The Post to Mr. Murdoch for $31 million. She did not give a reason, but it was widely assumed that she was pessimistic about the future of afternoon papers in the city.         ''The reason has been widely misconstrued,'' she said later in an interview. ''It was not sold for 'estate purposes.' Evening papers in urban areas have not survived. The Post had a deficit in 1975 and was a heavy loser in 1976, and I could no longer meet the deficits.''         In an interview last year, Mrs. Schiff said of her long ownership of the Post, ''It was a terrible headache.'' She said that she was then, in 1988, spending her time on needlepoint and other less stressful activities.         Mrs. Schiff married Rudolf Sonneborn, a Baltimore industrialist, in 1953. They separated in 1965 and were later divorced.         Surviving are the children of the first marriage, Mortimer W. Hall of Millbrook, N.Y., and Adele Hall Sweet, of Manhattan; a daughter from the second marriage, Sarah-Ann Kramarsky, also of Manhattan; 15 grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.
