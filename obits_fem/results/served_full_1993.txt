         Diana Adams, who was a leading ballerina with both the New York City Ballet and American Ballet Theater and the former dean of students at the School of American Ballet, died on Sunday at Mark Twain-St. Joseph's Hospital in San Andreas, Calif. She was 66 and lived in Arnold, Calif.         Miss Adams was one of George Balanchine's favorite dancers and created roles in many of his major ballets of the 1950's. Among her most complex parts was the almost fiendishly demanding pas de deux she danced with Arthur Mitchell in the Balanchine-Stravinsky "Agon" in 1957. Mr. Mitchell later said of the duet and its unusual pivots and balances, "Diana's nervous intensity made the whole pas de deux work because it's not so much the difficulty of the steps or how flexible you are, it's the precariousness."         She also appeared in films, performing with Danny Kaye in "Knock on Wood" (1954) and in "Invitation to the Dance" (1956), directed by Gene Kelly. A Versatile Talent         Miss Adams was born in Staunton, Va. Her family later moved to New York City, and she studied there at Ballet Arts School, where one of her teachers was Agnes de Mille. Miss Adams made her stage debut in 1943 in the Rodgers and Hammerstein musical "Oklahoma!," choreographed by Miss de Mille. In 1944, she joined Ballet Theater, as American Ballet Theater was then known.         Her talent and versatility were soon recognized. She performed the title role in David Lichine's comic "Helen of Troy," was the malevolent Queen of the Wilis in "Giselle," and was praised for her poignancy in Antony Tudor's bittersweet "Jardin aux Lilas" and for her ferocity in "Undertow," Tudor's ballet about slum life. In 1948, she created the role of the mother in Miss de Mille's "Fall River Legend."         She joined the New York City Ballet in 1950 and performed with it until 1963. She had a remarkable interpretative range and was as compelling in Balanchine'sabstractions as she was in Tudor's dance-dramas. John Martin wrote in The New York Times in 1951 that under Balanchine's guidance, Miss Adams "has become theepitome of the lyric dancer."         In addition to "Agon," she danced leading roles in the premieres of Tudor's "Lady of the Camellias" (1951), Frederick Ashton's "Picnic at Tintagel" (1952), and important Balanchine creations including "Caracole" (1952), "Opus 34" (1954), "Episodes" (1959) and "Liebeslieder Walzer" (1960). Transition Into Teaching         She began teaching at the School of American Ballet while still a member of the company. After she stopped dancing, she served as dean of students at Balanchine's request until she retired in 1971. It was Miss Adams who chose the teen-age Suzanne Farrell at a School of American Ballet audition in 1960.         Miss Adams married the dancer Hugh Laing in 1947; they were divorced in 1953. Her second marriage, to the stage manager and lighting designer Ronald Bates, also ended in divorce. In recent years, Miss Adams lived quietly in retirement, although she did teach for several companies, including the State Ballet of Missouri, which is directed by Todd Bolender, one of her former colleagues at the New York City Ballet.         She is survived by a daughter, Georgina Bates of Antioch, Calif.       
         Elizabeth Wood, a public housing pioneer who advocated racial and economic integration and the designing of workable neighborhoods, died yesterday at a nursing home near Atlanta. She was 93.         She suffered from Alzheimer's disease, a broken hip and a stroke, said Gisela Titman, a niece.         Miss Wood was the founding director of the Chicago Housing Authority, an Illinois state housing official and an officer of the National Association of Housing Officials. She was later a housing consultant in New York City and an administrator at the Federal Department of Housing and Urban Development.         Known as "Chicago's largest landlord," she headed the authority from 1937 to 1954, supervising the building and management of homes for thousands of families. Sought Real Neighborhoods         The philosophy she developed over the years was to mix residents by race, economic class and family size. She proposed that social workers help troubled families who might drag down a project.         Miss Wood favored small, dispersed projects rather than high-rise concentrations. A building's height should be limited to the distance that a mother in a window could be heard when calling to a child in a playground below, she said.         She urged planners to include shops, churches, parks and even pubs to turn housing complexes into real neighborhoods instead of human warehouses. Courtyards and indoor gathering places should have an inviting "design for loitering," she said. She sponsored flower-growing contests to brighten the projects.         Political pressure eventually forced Miss Wood out of her Chicago job. She said she fought with officials "and anybody else who stood in the way of getting homes built for the people."         She then went to New York, where she did studies for the City Housing Authority and the Citizens Housing and Planning Council of New York. From 1965 to 1972 she worked at H.U.D. in the Johnson and Nixon Administrations to coordinate housing policy with other social and poverty programs.         She won Guggenheim and Ford Foundation grants to study in Iran and analyze housing in India. She wrote numerous articles and books.         The daughter of a missionary teacher, Miss Wood was born in Nara, Japan, and grew up in Bloomington, Ill. After receiving bachelor's and master's degrees in rhetoric at the University of Michigan, she taught English for four years at Vassar College.         After moving to Chicago for doctoral studies, she instead became a social worker for United Charities. She then joined the Home Modernization Bureau, where a major contractor tutored her on the construction industry.         When the New Deal Public Works Administration began building housing, she became a planner. She also served as executive secretary of the Illinois Housing Board when it drafted a law creating housing authorities.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Beth Robertson Cosnow, a longtime community leader on the East Side of Manhattan, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 70.         The cause was lung cancer, said a friend, Lauren Giber.         Mrs. Cosnow, who was born in Dinuba, Calif., graduated from the University of California. She arrived in New York City after World War II and became involved in numerous neighborhood and block associations. As a Democratic district leader, she was a delegate to the 1984 Democratic National Convention and a leader emeritus of the Tilden Midtown Democratic Club.         Mrs. Cosnow, a co-founder of the First Women's Bank in Manhattan, also served in the 1960's as president of Friendly Visitors Inc., a women's volunteer group that provided social and recreational services to inmates of the city's Women's House of Detention in Manhattan. She was appointed an air-and-noise pollution ombudsman in the city's Department of Environmental Protection by Mayors Edward I. Koch and David N. Dinkins.         She was a past member of Manhattan Planning Board 6 and was active in the National Arts Club until the time of her death.         Her husband, Joseph Cosnow, died nine years ago. Survivors include her companion, Cyrus Rudman, and a sister, Laura Mulville, who lives in Florida.       
         Cynthia Wood, a horse breeder and patron of the arts, died on Saturday at her ranch in Santa Barbara. She was 55.         She died of cancer, said Merrillee Ford, a friend of the family.         Ms. Wood grew up on a working ranch in the Simi Valley, where her father, Adrian Gordon (Buddy) Wood, was a rancher, philanthropist, cultural leader and powerful figure in county politics. In 1968 she built showplace stables on a 22-acre property where she bred, trained and showed thoroughbred horses. She sold the property in 1983.         In her youth, Ms. Wood studied singing in the West and at the Metropolitan Opera. She worked for a time as an assistant stage manager at La Scala in Milan, Italy, and as an assistant to several opera directors.         She was the founding president of the Friends of the Vienna Philharmonic and served on the boards of the Lyric Opera of Chicago and the Community Arts Music Association of Santa Barbara.         She joined the Metropolitan Opera board in 1989. Her gifts to the company included new productions of "Parsifal," "Elektra" and "Lucia di Lammermoor"; the 1990 telecast of Wagner's "Ring" cycle, and underwriting for future new productions. The public television broadcast of "Parsifal" scheduled for April 7 is also one of her gifts.         She is survived by her mother, Ailene Claeyssens of Santa Barbara.       
         Dr. Blanche Bernstein, a prominent welfare expert and former government official whose criticisms of the welfare system provoked stormy policy debates, died yesterday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 80 and lived in Manhattan.         She died of lung cancer, said Barbara Rulnick, a niece.         Dr. Bernstein argued that the welfare system's major failing is in fostering continued dependency for people receiving aid, instead of guiding them off the welfare rolls to independence.         "Reduction of dependency is the greatest unmet need in social policy today," she once said. "We have not gotten to the heart of the problem."         Her pronouncements often stirred opposition from other officials, experts and advocates. Some accused her of being unsympathetic to poor people and minorities, which she denied.         Supporters said her aim was to help the truly needy while paring cheaters and ineligible recipients from welfare and reducing erroneous overpayments. High-Ranking Welfare Posts         In 1978-79 she headed the nation's largest local welfare agency when she served as the city's Human Resources Administrator, with more than a million residents receiving aid. Mayor Edward I. Koch appointed and praised her as "terrific."         But during her term more than 100,000 people were pared from the welfare rolls. After she came under fire from a number of black officials, Mr. Koch named a deputy with superseding power over her, and she resigned. The Mayor's action was widely interpreted as a concession to soothe his frayed minority relations.         Dr. Bernstein also served as the State Social Services Department's deputy commissioner for income maintenance from 1975-77, under Gov. Hugh L. Carey. She was in charge of public assistance, food stamps and welfare job programs.         Later she recounted her battles and explained her policies in "The Politics of Welfare: The New York City Experience" (Abt, 1982), which Fortune magazine called "wonderfully instructive."         An economist, Dr. Bernstein earlier held policy posts in the State Department, worked for charities, was an educator and researched a wide array of social problems.         Among the issues she studied were foster care, the effect of welfare on family stability, obstacles to drug treatment for addicts, impoverished Jews, day care, obstacles to employment for welfare recipients, mental health care, welfare spending, family budgets and prenatal care. Director at New School         Dr. Bernstein focused increasingly on the growing and entwined problems of teen-age mothers, single-parent families, poor education, school dropout and unemployment. Unless society "breaks the cycle of dependency and poverty," she said, "we are in danger of creating a permanent underclass."         On leaving government in 1979, she became the director of the Social Policy Research Institute at the New School for Social Research. The institute studied welfare, housing, health care, child neglect and abuse and services for the aged.         After retiring from the New School, she remained in education as a trustee of the City University of New York.         Dr. Bernstein was born in New York City. She graduated from Hunter College and received a master's degree and a doctorate in economics at Columbia.         Her survivors include a brother, Hilliard, of Manhattan.       
         Jeanne Sauve, a former Speaker of Parliament and Governor General of Canada in the 1980's, died on Tuesday in Montreal. She was 70.         Her death was announced by the office of the Governor General, who represents Queen Elizabeth II. It did not give the cause of death.         A former television journalist and freelance columnist, Mrs. Sauve entered politics in 1972 by winning election as a Member of Parliament from a district outside Montreal now known as Laval-les-Rapides.         After two years as a back-bencher, she was named as a junior minister in the Government of Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, overseeing science and technology and eventually the environment and communications. A Difficult Passage         But it was as Speaker, the keeper of the rules and traditions in the lower house, that Mrs. Sauve broke barriers and gained a national reputation.         When she was named to the post in 1980, she was still best known as part of a political elite that had congregated in Montreal in the 1950's to discuss art and politics and nationalism.         One participant was Mr. Trudeau, then a law professor and editor; another was Rene Levesque, a radio commentator who would later became a secessionist and Premier of Quebec, and a major adversary of Mr. Trudeau.         Her appointment drew criticism. Not only was she the first woman to preside over a forum that is still overwhelmingly male, but she was viewed by the Conservative opposition as lacking established ties to the House and knowledge of its often baroque procedures.         In her first two years, Mrs. Sauve was severely tested by strategists from the opposition who barraged her with points of order and privilege. But eventually even her adversaries paid tribute to her firmness and fairness, and she remained Speaker until 1984. Finally Won Respect         When Mr. Trudeau named her to the largely ceremonial but highly respected position of Governor General, she was also the first woman in that post, where she served until 1990.         Mrs. Sauve was born Jeanne Benoit in Prud'homme, Saskatchewan, on April 26, 1922. She was educated at the University of Ottawa and University of Paris.         In 1948 she married Maurice Sauve, a businessman who also served as a minister to Mr. Trudeau; he died last year. She is survived by a son, Jean-Francois.         Correction:  January 29, 1993, Friday         An obituary headline yesterday about a former Speaker of Parliament and Governor General of Canada misidentified her. She was Jeanne Sauve.       
         Joyce V. Nadelman, a former Foreign Service aide who was also active in Riverdale, the Bronx, died on Saturday at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 75.         She died of heart failure, her husband said.         Mrs. Nadelman, formerly Joyce Cavanah, was born in Mount Vernon, Ind., and graduated from Boston University. She entered the Foreign Service in 1944 and was assigned to the United States Embassy in Warsaw. She also served at the American embassies in Lisbon, London, Prague and Paris.         She resigned in 1947 when she married E. Jan Nadelman, a career Foreign Service officer. They served together in diplomatic posts in Poland, Italy, Germany, and Liberia and at the State Department in Washington.         She is survived by her husband; a son, Philip J., and a daughter, Cynthia J., all of New York.       
         Dorothy K. Willner, a sociologist who persuaded the United Nations to adopt guidelines protecting the rights of consumers, died on Saturday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 73 and lived in Manhattan and Southampton, L.I.         She had cancer of the small intestine, her husband, Sidney, said.         Mrs. Willner served as the representative of the International Organization of Consumers Unions at the United Nations from 1974 to 1983. She campaigned for the voluntary guidelines, which were a statement of principles to assist governments, particularly those in developing countries, in establishing consumer protection policies. They were eventually adopted by a consensus of the General Assembly in 1985.         "It was really a pioneering piece of work," Rhoda Karpatkin, president of Consumers Union, said of Mrs. Willner's efforts at the United Nations.         She graduated from Bryn Mawr College and earned a doctorate in sociology at the University of Pennsylvania. She taught at the University of Maryland, George Washington University, New York University and Upsala College. She was a visiting scholar at Columbia University and also worked with several other organizations at the United Nations, including Unicef.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Karen Ferguson of Washington and Denise Pavia of Manhattan, and a grandson.       
         Barbara Redmond Ryan, a volunteer for social causes, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 59.         Her husband, Allan A. Ryan 3d, said the cause of death was cancer.         Mrs. Ryan was a member of the women's committee of the Boys' Club of New York for 30 years and served on the club's board for 20 years. She was a co-founder of the committee's Homework Help program, which provides after-school counseling for underprivileged youth.         She was an active member of the Zoological Society of New York and of the New York Junior League, and a longtime organizer of Les Boutiques de Noel, which raises funds for Cancer Care, the Children's Aid Society and other organizations.         Mrs. Ryan, a native New Yorker, graduated from Vassar College in 1955.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Melissa and Sally, both of Manhattan; a son, Allan A. 4th, of Palm Beach, Fla.; her mother, Frances Jones Redmond of Essex, Conn.; a sister, Jean Cushing of Riverside, Conn., and two grandchildren.       
         Hortense Freezer Kobrin, who was a leader in charitable causes, died on Thursday while on vacation in Miami Beach. She was 87 and lived in Manhattan.         Her family said heart failure was the cause of death.         Mrs. Kobrin was a founder of the First Hebrew Day Nursery for orphans in Manhattan and of the Parents' Council of Ramaz School, a Jewish day school. For many years she served on the executive committee of Hadassah's New York chapter and held other offices in that organization.         In recent years she pursued her interest in painting, specializing in abstract oils, and had a show last year in Stamford, Conn.         Mrs. Kobrin was born in Manhattan. After graduating from Hunter College, she taught school for several years.         She was married for 58 years to Irving Kobrin, a business executive, who died in 1990.         Mrs. Kobrin is survived by three sons, Lawrence and Richard, both of Manhattan, and Jay, of Stamford and Sante Fe, N.M.; a sister, Thelma F. Diamond of Manhattan, and five grandchildren.       
         Andrea Boroff Eagan, a journalist, educator, union founder and advocate for women, died on Tuesday at Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan. She was 49 and lived in Brooklyn.         The cause of death was cancer, her family said.         The interwoven themes of her career were social change, group action, women's rights, health and writing. Her causes grew from beliefs she formed as a campus activist in the turbulent protests of the 1960's.         In a celebrated moment during the Columbia University protests in 1968, she and Richard Eagan were unofficially married in a seized building. A chaplain pronounced them "children of the New Age." They were later legally married by that same chaplain.  Feminist Advice for Girls         Drawing on her personal experiences, Ms. Eagan wrote the first feminist advice book for teen-age girls, "Why Am I So Miserable, if These Are the Best Years of My Life?" (Lippincott, 1976). Later she wrote "The Newborn Mother: Stages of Her Growth" (Little, Brown, 1985), about the psychological changes in women after childbirth.         She also wrote many newspaper and magazine articles, mostly on health and women. She was the editor of the National Women's Health Network Series for Pantheon Books and president of Healthright, a nonprofit organization.         Ms. Eagan was active in local and national efforts for abortion rights and other health and women's issues. She taught about them at New York University and at La Guardia, Manhattan Community and Hunter Colleges.         From 1983 to 1987 she served as the founding president of the National Writers Union, which won contracts for freelance writers at several national magazines. She was also a founding board member of the Writers Room, Manhattan office space for writers free of distractions.         Ms. Eagan, who graduated from Columbia in 1969, reaffirmed her protest-era beliefs in a 1988 interview in The Washington Post: "The fact is, we were absolutely correct in what we perceived as being wrong. We were in error only in that we weren't successful."         Her survivors include her mother, Dorothy Boroff of Manhattan; her husband, Richard, and two daughters, Molly and Daisy, the Tony-award winning child actress in "The Secret Garden."       
         Claire Huchet Bishop, an author of popular children's books and a leading opponent of anti-Semitism, died on Thursday at her home in Paris at the age of 94. She had resided in Manhattan for about 50 years.         The cause of death was a hemorrhage of the aorta, said Mira Felner, a friend.         Mrs. Huchet Bishop began her career following in the footsteps of her grandfather and mother, noted storytellers in her hometown of Le Havre, France. She carried on that tradition in Paris and the United States, then began transcribing her stories. Many Translations         Her resulting books, which won several prizes, have appeared in a dozen languages, and some continue to be reprinted. Two were made into films. Her first book, "The Five Chinese Brothers" (Coward), is being translated to Spanish, 55 years after its original publication.         The persecution of Jewish friends in France in World War II prompted the second theme of Mrs. Huchet Bishop's life. She began writing for children and adults on spiritual issues and became an advocate in efforts for religious and racial harmony.         A Catholic, she was credited with helping win the deletion of anti-Semitic passages from the catechism with her analysis, "How Catholics Look at Jews" (Paulist Press, 1974). In a delegation visiting the Pope in the 1980's, she encouraged formal Vatican recognition of Israel.         She also served as the president of the International Council of Christians and Jews in 1975-77 and of the Jewish-Christian-Fellowship of France from 1968 to 1981.         Mrs. Huchet Bishop was born in Geneva. As a young woman, she discontinued her studies at the Sorbonne to devote more time to storytelling. In 1924 she opened France's first library for children, L'Heure Joyeuse (The Joyous Hour), and served as its director for five years.         She married Frank Bishop, an American concert pianist, and moved to the United States. She was in charge of the children's reading room at the New York Public Library in the mid-1930's and was the children's book editor of Commonweal.         After retelling a fable about Chinese quintuplets with superhuman powers, she decided to write down her version. That led to its publication and her career as an author of about 30 books. Two were runners-up for the Maybery Award, the highest honor for children's books, and she won other awards and citations.         Often her books had serious themes. "Pancakes-Paris" (Viking, 1947) was about food scarcity in wartime France. "Twenty and Ten" (Viking, 1952) told the true story of Christian French youngsters who hid their Jewish playmates from the Nazis. Wonderworks made it into a film, "Miracle at Moreau," for PBS television.         Her husband died in 1944.       
         Regina Kiely Fox, a New York sportswoman and philanthropist, died on Sunday at her home in North Salem, N.Y. She was 87.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Fox was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Marymount College in Tarrytown, N.Y. She was active in the Crescent Club in Huntington, L.I., where she once won the club championships in golf and tennis in the same year.         Her husband, Frank, founded a development corporation based in Brooklyn that in the 1920's and 1930's built many homes in Brooklyn and Queens and on Long Island. He died in 1976.         Mrs. Fox oversaw the charitable work of the Fox family. Together with her son Terence she founded the annual Frank Fox Memorial Polo Tournament to raise money for public television, museums, youth groups and educational institutions. Since 1984 the proceeds of the annual polo match have gone to the scholarship fund of Marymount College.         She also served as a judge at the North Salem Horse Show and the Piping Rock and Smithtown Horse Shows on Long Island.         Mrs. Fox is survived by a daughter, Constance; two other sons, Frank and Michael; eight grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Martha Dalrymple, a co-author of an exhaustive study of New York City landmarks, died on Monday in Portland, Ore., where she had moved 17 years ago. She was 89.         The cause of death was chronic lung disease and heart failure, said her half-sister, Joanna Stuart of Portland.         With Harmon H. Goldstone, a former chairman of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission, Miss Dalrymple wrote "History Preserved: A Guide to New York City Landmarks and Historic Districts" (1974). The book included city landmarks dating from 1650 to 1930.         Mr. Goldstone, an architect, was a major force in establishing the Landmarks Commission and served as its chairman from 1968 to 1973. Miss Dalrymple worked for several years as a volunteer for the commission, and their collaboration on the 576-page volume was a result.         She was a 1925 graduate of the University of Wisconsin, and began her career as a journalist. She worked for The Chicago Journal and then for The Associated Press, reporting from New York City, Washington, London, Rome and Moscow. She was hired by Nelson A. Rockefeller for the Office of Inter-American Affairs, for which he was the coordinator. She also wrote a history of the American International Association for Economic and Social Development, entitled "The A.I.A. Story: Two Decades of International Cooperation" (1968).       
         May Friend Goodman, who served for two decades as a representative of a leading international Jewish organization at the United Nations, died on Friday at her home in Cedarhurst, L.I. She was 85.         She died of heart failure, a family member said.         In 1952, Mrs. Goodman began her association as a nongovernmental representative at the United Nations through the World Union of Progressive Judaism. As a representative, she attended meetings of the Economic and Social Council and was an accredited spokeswoman for the World Union of Progressive Judaism. The World Union is the international body of Reform, Progressive, Liberal, and Reconstructionist Jews linking 1.5 million people in more than 20 countries.         Mrs. Goodman, who was born and educated in Chicago, graduated in 1930 from the University of Chicago. She wrote a number of plays for children sponsored by the Union of American Hebrew Congregations. She also wrote book reviews for Chicago publications. She was married to Rabbi Abram Vossen Goodman, now rabbi emeritus of Temple Sinai of Long Island.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Gail G. Schulhoff of Baltimore, and Judith G. Richter of Merion, Pa., and four grandsons.       
         Judith Rothschild, an abstract painter whose works were shown internationally and who left a multi-million-dollar estate to support contemporary American artists, died on Saturday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 71 and lived in Manhattan and in Wellfleet, Mass.         The cause was a stroke, her family said.         Ms. Rothschild painted for 55 years, beginning as a teen-ager. Her works are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Guggenheim Museum, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the National Gallery in Washington and the Fogg Art Museum in Cambridge, Mass., among others.         Her works were exhibited in many group shows and in several one-woman shows, including the first devoted to an American artist by the State Tretyakov Gallery in Moscow, in 1991. Legacy to Museums and Artists         Ms. Rothschild left a collection that included her paintings and major works by Mondrian, Matisse, Brancusi, Gris and Picasso. The estate could bring up to $40 million, said its executor, Erik Stapper, and Harvey Miller, the trustee of the Judith Rothschild Foundation.         Under her will, the proceeds are to be used to foster art by helping public galleries and museums buy works of contemporary American artists over the next 25 years.         Ms. Rothschild was a founder and president of the American Abstract Artists Association. She also served on the boards of the American Federation of Arts, the MacDowell Colony, the New York Studio School and the Provincetown Fine Arts Work Center.         A longtime colleague of Robert Motherwell, she joined him and a few other artists in forming a cooperative, the Long Point Gallery, in Provincetown on Cape Cod. A Youthful Talent         Ms. Rothschild displayed a flair for art as a youngster. Because of her interests, her parents began collecting art, including some of the major pieces now part of her estate. Her father, Herbert, owned a furniture manufacturing company.         Ms. Rothschild was born in New York City and graduated from Wellesley College. She studied painting at the Cranbrook Academy of Art, with Reginald Marsh at the Art Students League, and with Karl Knaths and Hans Hofmann.         She worked in oils and did many collages. Her style ranged from Cubist imagery to symbolic use of astrology charts, timetables, stamps and railroad tickets.         Her 23-year marriage to Anton Myrer, a novelist, ended in divorce.

         Rachel Higgins Everson, a civic leader and volunteer worker in Brooklyn for a half-century, died on Wednesday at the age of 91 at Southport Manor in Southport, Conn. A longtime resident of Brooklyn Heights, she had lived in Westport, Conn., in recent years.         The cause of death was a stroke, her family said.         Mrs. Everson, known as Peggy, started as a volunteer at Colony South Brooklyn Houses, a settlement house, in 1924, the year of her marriage to Alfred Hall Everson. She served on many committees to enhance neighborhood life into the 1970's.         She was born in Brooklyn, the daughter of Charles M. Higgins, the inventor of liquid India ink.

         Grace Lansing Lambert, a philanthropist and breeder of champion dogs and horses, died on Thursday at The Medical Center at Princeton, in Princeton, N.J. A resident of Princeton, she was 93.         The cause of death was pneumonia and advanced Parkinson's disease, according to the death certificate.         Mrs. Lambert was the widow of Gerard Barnes Lambert, her second husband, whose family's fortune was built on Listerine mouthwash and the manufacturing concern that became part of the Warner-Lambert Company.

Mrs. Lambert is survived by two stepdaughters, Rachel Mellon of Upperville, Va., and Lily McCarthy of Bryn Mawr, Pa.; seven grandchildren, and 20 great-grandchildren.       
         Dr. Lillian Batlin Garvey, a family physician who practiced on the Upper East Side for 47 years, died on Friday at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 77 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was bone marrow disease, her family said.         The physician, known professionally as Dr. Batlin, continued to see patients until illness overcame her in February. She also taught for many years as a clinical assistant professor of medicine at New York Medical College and worked on the staff of Metropolitan Hospital Center and Beth Israel Hospital North.

She had homes in Palm Beach, Manhattan, Monte Carlo and Newport, R.I.         The cause was heart failure, her family said.         She was a supporter of Save the Bay in Newport and an organizer of fund-raising events for many other charities.

         Raphaelle Jeanne Semmes, a senior civil servant who became executive director of the Bush Administration's Commission on Environmental Quality, died Tuesday at the Washington Home Hospice. She was 46 and lived in Washington.         The cause was cancer, said her sister Walden S. Morton.         Miss Semmes went into Government service in 1970 as a supervisor in the Department of Transportation. She served as executive secretary of the Peace Corps from 1982 to 1989.

         Sylvia A. Boone, a scholar of African and women's art and the first black woman to be granted a tenured professorship at Yale University, died on Tuesday at her home on campus. She was 52.         The cause was heart failure, said a friend, Vera Wells.         Dr. Boone, a professor of art history and Afro-American studies, specialized in African art, female imagery, women's arts and masks.         In Yale's early years of coeducation in the 1970's, she taught a course on black women and served on the executive committee for the women's studies program. She also organized an early conference on black women and founded a black film festival.         Her writings include "Radiance from the Waters: Ideals of Feminine Beauty in Mende Art" (Yale, 1986) and "West African Travels: A Guide to Peoples and Places" (Random House, 1974). Her work won awards, fellowships and grants. She lectured internationally and was a consultant to the Smithsonian Institution and other museums.         Dr. Boone was a vice president and scholarship chairwoman of the Roothbert Fund, which aids students training for education careers. She also served on UNICEF's committee for selecting its annual fund-raising holiday greeting cards.         She was instrumental in organizing the 150th anniversary commemoration of the 1839 rebellion of 53 kidnapped Africans on the slave ship Amistad who were jailed in New Haven for mutiny but were eventually freed. She called the episode "a tale of triumph."         A native of Mount Vernon, N.Y., Dr. Boone graduated from Brooklyn College and earned a master's degree in social sciences at Columbia.         Next she studied at the University of Ghana, where she became friendly with visiting black Americans, including Malcolm X, Maya Angelou and W.E.B. Du Bois.         She started at Yale as a visiting lecturer in Afro-American studies in 1970. After earning master's and doctoral degrees in art history there, she joined the faculty in 1979 and was promoted to a tenured, full professor in 1988.         Her survivors include three brothers, J. Herbert, of Newport News, Va., Edgar S., of St. Petersburg, Fla., and John D., of Los Angeles.       
         Maggie Hemingway, a British novelist, died on May 9, the British press reported late last week. She was 47 and lived in London and in Deal, a seaside resort near Dover.         The cause was defective functioning of the blood-forming organs, The Daily Telegraph said.         Ms. Hemingway won the Royal Society of Literature's Winifred Holtby Prize for her first novel, "The Bridge," which was published in Britain in 1986 and won critical praise there and in the United States.         Reviewing Atheneum's American edition in February 1987 in The New York Times Book Review, Eden Ross Lipson, an editor of the Book Review, wrote, "If you like your tea and fiction delicately seasoned and served exquisitely, this novel may be a perfect midwinter cup."         Ms. Hemingway was a distant relative of Ernest Hemingway, The Times of London said. She was born in Orford, in eastern Suffolk, studied at Edinburgh University and worked in publishing until "The Bridge" came out. Her other published novels are "Stop House Blues" (1988) and "The Postmen's House" (Trafalgar, 1992). She finished a fourth work of fiction, "Eyes," before she died.         Ms. Hemingway was separated from her husband and is survived by two daughters.       
         Dame Freya Stark, a resourceful and scholarly travel writer who was the first Westerner to journey through many regions of the Middle East, died on Sunday at her home in Asolo in northeast Italy. She was 100..         Dame Freya, who was born in Paris and grew up in several homes in England and Italy, wrote 24 travel books and autobiographies and eight volumes of letters from the 1930's to the 1980's. Many of the books have been reprinted several times, recently by Transatlantic Arts and Overlook Press, among other houses, and were based on often hazardous journeys by vehicle, camel and donkey.         Dame Freya's books about the Middle East and nearby countries were called lucid, spontaneous and elegant and were lauded for imparting an inspired sense of both history and people. The consensus of reviewers was that she wrote with spirit, authority and humor and that she was a consummate traveler because of her fearlessness, candor, charm, idealism and streak of naivete.         In a foreword to "The Journey's Echo: Selections From Freya Stark" (1964), the writer Lawrence Durrell praised her as a "poet of travel" and "one of the most remarkable women of our age." Many Languages and Dialects         Dame Freya was essentially self-taught. In her youth, she became fluent in Arabic and Turkish, and over the years she mastered other languages and many dialects. It was a talent that served her well in the course of a venturesome life as reflected in the titles of her books: "Baghdad Sketches" (1933 and 1937), "The Valleys of the Assassins and Other Persian Travels" (1934, 1972 and 1978), "The Southern Gates of Arabia: A Journey in the Hadhramaut" (1936 and 1972), "A Winter in Arabia" (1940, 1972 and 1987), "Letters From Syria" (1942), "The Freya Stark Story" (1953), "Alexander's Path" (1958 and 1988) and "Gateways and Caravans: A Portrait of Turkey" (1971).         Freya Madeline Stark was born in Paris on Jan. 31, 1893, to Robert Stark, a British sculptor, and Flora Stark, a painter and pianist. Her parents separated in her childhood, and her formal education was mainly at the University of London and the nearby School of Oriental and African Studies.         In World War I she was a nurse in Italy, and in World War II she worked for the British Information Ministry, earning prominence and honors for enhancing British influence and countering Axis propaganda in Aden, Yemen, Egypt, Iraq and India. In Cairo, she founded the Brotherhood of Freedom, a democratic anti-Fascist movement.         Years later, she observed that Britain eventually lost India and prestige throughout the Middle East because of "a lack of clearness and faith in our own values." Honors and Godchildren         She was awarded a Cross of the British Empire in 1953 and was named a Dame of the British Empire in 1972.         In 1947, when she was 54, she married Stewart Perowne, a diplomat and historian. They separated in 1952 but did not divorce. Mr. Perowne died in 1989. They had no children, but Dame Freya had many godchildren, in many countries.         One godson, Malise Ruthven, wrote a 144-page tribute, "Traveler Through Time: A Photographic Journey With Freya Stark," which was published in 1986. In the book, he observed: "Freya never lost her passion for acquiring fresh knowledge and new skills. Writing, like travel, she saw as the pursuit of truth."         At 93, as she was planning a trip to Spain, Dame Freya was asked about death. She replied, "I feel about it as about the first ball, or the first meet of hounds, anxious as to whether one will get it right, and timid and inexperienced -- all the feelings of youth."       
         Penelope Gilliatt, a writer of fiction, journalism and screenplays, and a longtime film critic for The New Yorker, died on Sunday at her home in London. She was 61.         She had been in poor health for some time.         Ms. Gilliatt (pronounced with a hard G) was best known for the film criticism she wrote from 1968 to 1979 for The New Yorker, where she shared reviewing duties with Pauline Kael, and for her screenplay for "Sunday, Bloody Sunday," a 1971 film starring Glenda Jackson and Peter Finch.         Her short stories were marked by precision, compression and a gift for conveying a dramatic situation through dialogue. Anthony Burgess, reviewing her short-story collection "Nobody's Business" for The New York Times Book Review in 1971, wrote: "She is intelligent, economical, poignant, highly contemporary. She is also innovative."         Ms. Gilliatt, whose maiden name was Penelope Conner, was born in London. Her father, a barrister and later a judge, worked as a director of the BBC. After attending Queen's College, a private school, she came to the United States to enter Bennington College in Vermont on a scholarship. She dropped out during her first year. "I thought I should get on with life, and I'd run out of money," she later said in a newspaper interview. A Contest Winner         A brief period working for the Institute of Pacific Relations in New York ended when she won a short-story contest sponsored by British Vogue. She returned to London to join the magazine's staff, eventually becoming its features editor. She also contributed freelance articles to The Spectator and New Statesman.         From 1961 to 1967, Ms. Gilliatt served as film critic and, for one year, drama critic of The Observer in London. In 1968 she joined The New Yorker, where, in addition to reviewing film, she contributed many short stories and profiles.         Her first novel, "One by One" (1965), about a menage a trois, contained the seeds of her screenplay for "Sunday, Bloody Sunday," about a London couple, a man and a woman, in love with the same man. The screenplay, which was widely praised for its sensitive, literate treatment of a potentially exploitative subject, was nominated for an Academy Award.  The National Society of Film Critics named it the best screenplay of the year, and the New York film critics, in a tie vote, named her co-winner for best screenplay with Larry McMurtry, for "The Last Picture Show.         Ms. Gilliatt left The New Yorker in 1979 on an extended leave of absence after writing a profile on the novelist Graham Greene whose accuracy was challenged by Greene. A novelist, Michael Mewshaw, also complained to the magazine that material in the article had been taken, without credit, from an artcile he had written on Greene for The Nation. At the time, Ms. Gilliatt said that Mr. Greene's charges were a subtle form of practical joke. She continued to contribute short stories to the magazine and in recent years wrote profiles of John Cleese and Jonathan Miller. Known for Her Stories         Although Ms. Gilliatt wrote five novels, including "A State of Change" (1968) and "The Cutting Edge" (1979), she was best known for her stories, collected in "Come Back if It Doesn't Get Better" (1969), "Nobody's Business" (1972), "Splendid Lives" (1978), "Quotations From Other Lives" (1982) and "They Sleep Without Dreaming" (1985).         Ms. Gilliatt's New Yorker film criticism and profiles were collected in "Unholy Fools" (1973) and "Three-Quarter Face" (1980). Her last book was "To Wit: Skin and Bones of Comedy" (1990), a collection of essays.         Both her marriages, to Roger Gilliatt, a neurosurgeon, and the playwright John Osborne ended in divorce.         She is survived by a sister, Angela Conner of London, and a daughter, Nolan Osborne Parker of East Sussex.       
         Margaret Bush Clement, an aunt of former President George Bush, died on Saturday at the Connecticut Hospice in Branford. She was 93 and lived in Hamden, Conn.         She died of cancer, a spokesman for the Hawley Lincoln Funeral Home in Guilford, Conn., said.         Mrs. Clement was the daughter of Samuel Prescott and Flora Sheldon Bush, President Bush's grandparents. In 1911 she married Stuart Holmes Clement of Buffalo and moved to New Haven, where she served with numerous civic organizations, including the Red Cross, the United Way, the Women's Auxiliary of New Haven Hospital and the New Haven Tuberculosis Association.         Mrs. Clement served as trustee of the Westover School in Middlebury, Conn.         She is survived by two sons, Stuart Holmes Clement Jr. of Saybrook, Conn., and Samuel Prescott Bush Clement of Litchfield, Conn.; a daughter, Mary Bush Clement Estabrook of North Haven, Conn.; 12 grandchildren, and 14 great-granchildren.       
         Beatrice Bishop Berle, a physician, teacher and author, died on Friday at her home in Great Barrington, Mass.  She was 90 years old.         Her death was caused by complications from a stroke, said her daughter, Beatrice Berle Meyerson.         Dr. Berle, who ran a neighbhorhood health clinic in East Harlem from 1953 until 1962, took a pioneering approach to family medicine by treating the entire family for the effects of heroin abuse by a member. She also helped to establish methadone maintenance as a significant treatment for heroin abuse.         Dr. Berle, who was born on Aug. 6, 1902, in Lenox, Mass, graduated from Vassar College in 1923. She received a master's degree in history from Columbia University in 1924 and a medical degree from New York University in 1938.         In 1927 she married Adolf A. Berle Jr., an economist and lawyer who served during the Roosevelt Administration as Assistant Secretary of State. Dr. Berle worked in the United States Public Health Service in Washington from 1943 until 1944. Worked in Brazil         Traveling to Brazil with her husband, who was Ambassador to Brazil from 1945 until 1946, Dr. Berle volunteered in hospital wards in Rio de Janeiro, where she organized efforts to expand the practice of preventive medicine. She also wrote articles and edited a book on medical problems in Brazil.         Her other books were "Eighty Puerto Rican Families in New York City," a study of the families in her East Harlem clinic, published by Columbia University Press in 1958, and "A Life in Two Worlds," an autobiography published in in 1983 by Walker & Company.         During her career, Dr. Berle was associated with St. Luke's Hospital Center, Mount Sinai Hospital, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at the Bronx State Hospital, Cornell University Medical College, New York University Medical College and Yeshiva University.         After the death of her first husband in 1971, Dr. Berle in 1975 married Dr. Andre F. Cournand, a physican who was awarded the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1956. Dr. Cournand died in 1988.         In addition to Ms. Meyerson, of Washington, Dr. Berle is survived by another daughter, Alice Berle Crawford of Ann Arbor, Mich.; a son, Peter A. A. Berle of Manhattan; 10 grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth Steinway Chapin, a member of the New York State Council on the Arts and a volunteer for many other cultural organizations, died yesterday at Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 68 and lived on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         The cause was bone cancer, said her husband, Schuyler G. Chapin, who is dean emeritus of Columbia University's School of the Arts and a former general manager of the Metropolitan Opera.         Mrs. Chapin was a scion of the piano-making Steinway family. She had been on the Arts Council, which administers grants to arts organizations, since 1978. At her death, she was also the senior trustee of the Harlem School of the Arts.         She retired recently as chairman of the Alliance of Resident Theaters-New York, and from the boards of the Professional Children's School and the New York Revels. In addition, she had been a trustee of the Dalton School, where she was also employed for many years, in a variety of positions. Libraries' Benefactor         In 1971, Mrs. Chapin created a group that became the Volunteers of the New York Public Library. She also served as co-chairwoman of the Committee for the Library of the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center.         In 1975 she became a founding member of the Citizens Committee for New York City, which was formed to help the city during its fiscal crisis.         Mrs. Chapin was born in Plymouth, Mass., grew up in Manhattan, attended Dalton and Concord Academy in Concord, Mass., and graduated in 1945 from Radcliffe College. In addition to her husband of 46 years, she is survived by four sons, Henry B. of Manhattan; Theodore S. of Manhattan; Samuel G. of Hingham, Mass., and Miles W. of Manhattan; eight grandchildren; two brothers, Henry Z.

         Margaret M. Bryant, an expert on grammar, linguistics, proverbs and folklore, died on Monday at a retirement center in Clemson, S.C. She was 92.         Dr. Bryant was a retired English professor and author. She was a past president of the International Linguistic Association, American Society of Geolinguistics, the American Name Society and New York City chapter of the American Association of University Women. She was also a former chairwoman of the Present Day English Section of the Modern Language Association.

Her survivors include a sister, Marie B. Jeter of Ware Shoals, S.C.       
         Marjorie Henderson Buell, the creator of Little Lulu, the mischievous cartoon character with corkscrew curls who regularly outwitted the neighborhood boys, died on Sunday in the Elyria (Ohio) United Methodist Home. She was 88.         The cause was lymphoma, said John D. Harvith, the co-arranger in 1982 of the only comprehensive retrospective of Mrs. Buell's work, in Oberlin, Ohio.         "She was a pioneer in presenting a girl cartoon character who was resourceful, courageous and who regularly beat out the boys," said Mr. Harvith. Mrs. Buell, who was known as Marge, was also a role model for future cartoon entrepreneurs, since she kept control of the rights to the Little Lulu character. She licensed a host of spinoffs, including comic books, 26 animated cartoon features, greeting cards, dolls, games, puzzles, toys and coloring books.         The Lulu marketing empire was international, with comic books published in languages that included Arabic, Finnish, Japanese, Spanish and Greek. Mrs. Buell sold her copyrights to Western Publishing Company when she retired in 1971.         Mrs. Buell was born in Philadelphia on Dec. 11, 1904. Her first cartoon was published in 1921, when she was 16, in The Philadelphia Ledger. Soon her work found a market in the Ledger syndicate, and ultimately in Life, when it was a comic magazine, as well as The Saturday Evening Post, The Country Gentleman, Judge and Collier's.         In 1934 The Saturday Evening Post asked her to draw a weekly cartoon for the magazine's back page. George Horace Lorimer, the editor, wanted a young female character to take the place of another cartoon that was moving from The Post to King Features Syndicate.         The first "Little Lulu" drawing appeared in December 1935. So popular had the character become by 1944 that Mrs. Buell took Lulu and her friends Tubby, Alvin, Annie and Wilbur from The Post and made the cartoon a daily syndicated comic strip. Lulu also served as the advertising mascot for Kleenex tissues until 1960.         Mrs. Buell is survived by her husband, Clarence Addison Buell; two sons, Lawrence I., of Boston, and Frederick H., of Warwick, N.Y., and four grandchildren.       
         Ethel Hausman, a founder and major supporter of United Cerebral Palsy of New York City and North Shore University Hospital-Cornell University Medical College in Manhasset, L. I., died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         She died after a brief illness, her family said.         She and her husband, Jack, joined Leonard and Isabel Goldenson and Jane Hoving in 1946 to found United Cerebral Palsy of New York City. All were parents of children with the disease, including the Hausmans' son Peter, who died last year. Their efforts also led to the formation of the national United Cerebral Palsy Associations, which merged similar groups around the country. Efforts Raised Millions         Mrs. Hausman founded the Women's Division of United Cerebral Palsy of New York City and oversaw fund-raising campaigns that raised millions of dollars for the agency, which serves adults and children with cerebral palsy and related disabilities. She also was vice president of the International Cerebral Palsy Society in London and a board member of Rehabilitation International.         Mrs. Hausman devoted much of her life to helping others, especially chidren. With her husband, she was a principal donor to North Shore University Hospital-Cornell University Medical College, where the Ethel and Jack Hausman Department of Pediatrics attests to their support.         North Shore University Hospital opened in Manhasset in 1953. But Mrs. Hausman was already engaged in fund raising in the late 1940's, when local residents pressed for the construction of a hospital in the area. She later served as co-chairwoman of the interior design committee.         Ethel and Jack Hausman endowed chairs bearing their names for a professor of pediatrics at North Shore University Hospital and for cerebral-palsy research at Harvard University.         Born in Manhattan, Ethel Hausman went to work in a restaurant at age 16. In 1927, she married Jack Hausman, whose family fortune derived from the textile business. He is vice chairman and former chairman of Belding Heminway Company, the Manhattan textile concern.         Mrs. Hausman served as a volunteer ambulance driver in World War II. She was an original tour guide at United Nations headquarters and a member of the U.N.'s Department of Public Information from 1949-64.         Besides her husband of nearly 65 years, Mrs. Hausman is survived by two sons, Richard and Michael, both of Manhattan; six grandchildren, and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Eileen Nic, a lobbyist on environmental and health issues and longtime consultant to Consumers Union, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 42.         The cause was brain cancer, said Robbin Blaine, a colleague at Consumers Union, the nonprofit organization that publishes the magazine Consumer Reports.         Ms. Nic was instrumental in persuading the United Nations to publish a directory of banned and restricted pesticides, chemicals and other consumer products. As representative of the International Organization of Consumers Unions at the United Nations, she organized over 300 groups around the world in a network to work for the banning of the hazardous products listed in the directory, which was published in 1983.         She was co-author of a Consumers Union report in 1990 that named the eight biggest toxic polluters in the New York City area.         Among other activities, she served as a consultant on hazardous substances for the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council.         A native of Philadelphia, she graduated from Temple University and received a master's degree in sociology from Columbia University. She began her career on the staff of the Philadelphia Department of Health.         Surviving are her husband, Thierry Noyelle; her parents, Chester and Irene Nic, and a sister, Mary Ann Nic, all of Philadelphia.       
         R. Louise McManus, a leader in nursing education who spent 36 years on the faculty of Teachers College of Columbia University, died on Saturday at a nursing home in Natick, Mass. She was 97 and had lived in Manhattan before retiring to Massachusetts.         Her death came after a brief illness, the college reported.         On the faculty since 1925, Professor McManus served as director of the Division of Nursing Education at Teachers College from 1947 until her retirement in 1961. At the college she founded the Institute of Research and Service in Nursing Education.         Professor McManus was a native of North Smithfield, R.I.         She was a past chairman of the nursing council of the Florence Nightingale International Foundation. Teachers College named its Nursing Education Alumni Medal after her in 1964.         Professor McManus is survived by four daughters, Joan Lawrence of Natick, Madeline Frankenhauser of Falmouth, Mass., Catherine Myers of Wilmington, Del., and Anna McThaden of Seattle; 23 grandchildren, 37 great-grandchildren, and a great-great-grandchild.       
         Genevieve Millet Landau, former editor in chief of Parents magazine and an expert in child development, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 69.         The cause was cancer, the family said.         Mrs. Landau joined the staff of Parents in 1957, becoming editor in chief in 1970. She resigned from the magazine in 1978 to create the Hasbro Center for Child Development and Education, a nonprofit arm of the Hasbro Toy Company.         She served as editorial director of the Dell Magazine Group from 1981 until she retired in 1987. She later worked as a volunteer for the Fortune Society, a nonprofit organization that helps former convicts.         She graduated in 1954 from Hobart and William Smith Colleges. Besides numerous articles, she was the author of a book, "The Gift of Play," (Walker & Company, 1980), with Maria W. Piers.         Survivors include her husband, Sidney; two daughters, Elizabeth Millet of Manhattan and Jessica Rosenberg of Brooklyn, and two grandchildren.       
         Gloria E. Wise, who led a sit-in at a lunch counter in the South in 1960 and became a New York City social work administrator and head of a popular youth program, died on June 7 at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 56 and lived in the Bronx.         The cause was brain cancer, her family said.         For her life's work in promoting racial and ethnic harmony, Mrs. Wise won the John V. Lindsay prize from the Citizens' Committee for New York City earlier this year. She donated the $5,000 award to her Youth Activities Committee, which sponsors after-school and summer programs.         As the student government president of Bennett College in Greensboro, N.C., Mrs. Wise joined four male students in protesting the whites-only rule at the local Woolworth lunch counter in 1960. She was among the first black women to demonstrate.         "Everybody was afraid, because we didn't know what was going to happen," she recalled. "But we did it because we wanted to be able sit down at a lunch counter."         Mrs. Wise was a city social worker for 31 years and became the director of case management resources at the Spofford Juvenile Center in the Bronx.         She retired there last year to devote full-time to her volunteer job as the executive director of the youth committee, which she helped found 17 years ago. It has served more than 20,000 youngsters from Co-op City and its neighborhood with education, recreation, culture and career programs.         Mrs. Wise was born in Manhattan. After graduating from Bennett she earned a master's degree in social work at Columbia University. She was a trustee of the Bronx Trinity United Methodist Church.         She was married to Leroy Wise, who is dead.         Surviving are her parents, Clarise and William E. Brown Sr., of the Bronx; three brothers, William Jr., of the Bronx, and Donald and Rodney, both of Atlanta, and two sisters, Juanita Garrido, of Goose Creek, S.C., and Diane Brown, of the Bronx.       
         Dr. Gladys Lounsbury Hobby, a microbiologist who helped to move penicillin from a laboratory discovery to mass production during World War II, died on Sunday at her home at the Crosslands retirement community in Kennett Square, Pa. She was 82.         The cause was a heart attack, Pfizer Inc. said. She had worked at Pfizer's Brooklyn plant.         In her book, "Penicillin: Meeting the Challenge" (Yale University Press, 1985), Dr. Hobby chronicled penicillin's precarious journey from laboratory to factory, beginning with Sir Alexander Fleming's intriguing find of 1928. Discussing the program to make the drug available in large quantities in the face of wartime needs in the early 1940's, she likened its urgency and scope to the Manhattan Project, which produced the atom bomb.         She had first helped to refine penicillin specifically for the treatment of infections as a member of a research team at the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Columbia University. Then, in 15 years at Pfizer, she also worked to develop streptomycin and other antibiotics.         A specialist in antimicrobial therapy, she was among those who did the early work on the broad-spectrum Terramycin and contributed to the understanding of how such drugs work.         A native of Manhattan, Dr. Hobby graduated from Vassar College in 1931 and earned her master's degree and a Ph.D. in bacteriology at Columbia. She was associated with Presbyterian Hospital and the Columbia Medical School from 1934 to 1943, after which she joined Chas Pfizer & Company to continue her research.         She left Pfizer in 1959 to become chief of research at the Veterans Administration Hospital in East Orange, N.J., where she specialized in chronic infectious diseases. Until her retirement in 1977 she also served as an assistant clinical research professor in public health at Cornell University Medical College.         She then worked as a consultant and freelance science writer. She was the author of some 200 publications and for eight years edited Antimicrobial Agents and Chemotherapy, a monthly she founded in 1972.         Dr. Hobby is survived by a sister, Winifred Evans, also of Kennett Square.       
         Darcy M. Cohen, the former owner of the Vernissage decorative arts boutique at the Henri Bendel store in Manhattan, died on Tuesday at her home in London. She was 68.         She had had a long illness, her family said.         Mrs. Cohen operated the Vernissage shop in the late 1960's and early 1970's. Earlier in her career she worked as a writer for the Tex McCrary and Jinx Falkenberg radio program.         Ms. Cohen was born in Manhattan. Her grandfather, Israel Miller, was the founder of the I. Miller & Sons women's shoe stores.         She graduated from the Birch Wathen School in Manhattan, where she later served as a trustee, and from Smith College.         Mrs. Cohen was married for 25 years to Raymond Frisch and then divorced.         Her survivors include her husband of 20 years, Stanley; a son, Walter Frisch of Manhattan; a daughter, Devin Feldman of Queens; a brother, E. Jerrold Miller of Capri, Italy, and four grandchildren.       
         Elinor Merrell, a decorator and dealer in antique textiles, died on Saturday at the Mary Manning Walsh Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 98 and lived in Cross River, N.Y., and Manhattan.         Her lawyer, Theodore R. Wagner, said the cause was complications from a stroke last October.         For nearly 65 years, Miss Merrell operated her business, Elinor Merrell Antiques, in several different shops on the East Side of Manhattan and since 1981, from her apartment on East 78th Street. Amassing a major collection of museum-caliber textiles, she would sell swatches to fabric houses to copy.         A specialist in 17th- and 18th-century French textiles, she served as consultant to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and to the Art Institute of Chicago. She also assisted in the development of the collections at the Cooper-Hewitt Institute of Fine Arts, the Winterthur Museum and Colonial Williamsburg.         In 1954 Miss Merrell was a founder of the New York Winter Antiques Show, which developed a reputation for its top-quality art and decorative objects. She was a regular exhibitor at the show until 1990, when she and several other dealers pulled out over a dispute with the management.         She was born in Cleveland, attended finishing school in Switzerland and graduated from Vassar College in 1917. Afflicted with polio as a girl, she had to use a cane most of her life.         During a trip to Europe in the early 1920's, she discovered old French chintzes and toiles de Jouy (18th-century cotton prints) from a village near Versailles. She returned to New York and exhibited her antique textiles at the Anderson Galleries in 1925. Later she also developed an interest in French provincial furniture.         She is survived by two nieces, Jane Jennison of Taftville, Vt., and Susan Faragoh of Castro Valley, Calif., and a nephew, Frank Faragoh of Knoxville, Tenn.       
         Margaret Van Doren Bevans, author, editor and illustrator of children's books, died on Wednesday at Charlotte Hungerford Hospital in Torrington, Conn. She was 75 and lived in West Cornwall, Conn.         Her sister, Barbara Klaw, said the cause was lung cancer.         Mrs. Bevans's most widely distributed work is her illustrations for the original "Pat the Bunny," (Golden Books, 1940), created by Dorothy Kunhardt, the second-best-selling children's book ever, after "Peter Rabbit."         She is author and illustrator of "Thomas Retires," (Viking, 1939) a children's book. Other works include " 'I Wonder Why,' Thought the Owl," (Putnam, 1965) and "Danny Kaye's Around the World Story Book," (Random House, 1960), of which she was co-editor.         She was editor of a best-selling book for adults, "Vogue's Book of Etiquette," (Simon & Schuster, 1948), compiled by the late Millicent H. Fenwick. She also edited "McCall's Book of Everyday Etiquette" (Golden Press, 1960).         Born in New York City, she was the daughter of the historian and critic Carl Van Doren and of Irita Van Doren, for many years literary editor of The New York Herald Tribune. She studied art at Cooper Union in Manhattan.         In 1975 Mrs. Bevans and her family moved to West Cornwall, where she served on the Cornwall Board of Education from 1977 to 1983. She was also Cornwall's representative on the board of Housatonic Valley Regional High School.         She and her husband, Tom Torre Bevans, founded The Cornwall Chronicle in 1991. This monthly newspaper of community news is distributed free to all Cornwall residents and many out-of-town subscribers.         Besides her husband and sister of West Cornwall, surviving are two daughters, Anne Bevans of West Cornwall and Jane Duber of Lillooet, British Columbia; a son, John, of West Cornwall, and a granddaughter.         Correction:  July 25, 1993, Sunday         An obituary last Sunday about Margaret Van Doren Bevans, author and illustrator of children's books, included a work among her credits erroneously. "Pat the Bunny" (Golden Books, 1940) was illustrated by its author, Dorothy Kunhardt.       
         Mary Ellen Forbes Kramer, who led the campaign to preserve and redevelop the historic mill district in Paterson, N.J., died on Monday at a hospital in Norwalk, Conn. She was 56 and lived in Little Falls, N.J., and Weston, Conn.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Kramer became active in civic affairs as the wife of Paterson's Mayor for 14 years, Lawrence (Pat) Kramer. In her first major issue, she led the efforts that blocked state plans to build a highway that would have destroyed some old silk mills.         After that success, she became the executive director of the Great Falls Development Corporation and worked to preserve the mills, which were built in the early 1800's and used the water power of the 77-foot-high Great Falls. The buildings were adapted to new uses, including the Paterson Museum, offices and artists' residences.         In 1976, President Gerald R. Ford visited the district to proclaim its national landmark status, and the National Trust for Historic Preservation gave Mrs. Kramer an award. New Career at College         She started a new career in 1980 as the director of community affairs at William Paterson College in Wayne, N.J.         There she was instrumental in founding the Wayne Chamber Orchestra, creating the annual Legacy Awards to raise scholarship funds, collecting more than $300,000 to restore the Hobart Manor on campus and organizing a popular annual lecture series with speakers like Henry Kissinger, Norman Mailer, Alvin Toffler and Beverly Sills.         She also served on the boards of St. Joseph's Hospital and the Straight and Narrow drug and alcohol rehabilitation center, both in New Jersey.         Mrs. Kramer was born in Paterson. After graduating from Mary Washington College she earned a master's degree in clinical psychology from George Washington University and briefly practiced as a school psychologist. She was divorced.         Surviving are her companion, Irving Appleman; her mother, Catherine Forbes of Wyckoff, N.J.; a daughter, Patricia Kimberly Sposa of Vernon, N.J.; two sons, Lawrence 3d, also known as Kip, and Patrick, also known as Kelly, both of Paterson; three brothers, Cyril Forbes of Montclair, N.J., William Forbes of Paterson and Paul Forbes of Morristown, N.J., and two sisters, Joan Forbes of Wyckoff and Nancy Braithwaite of Nassau, the Bahamas.       
         Frances Ruth Grant, who spent her life opposing dictatorships and promoting human rights in the Americas, died on Wednesday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 96.         Miss Grant's dedication to Latin American culture, art and human rights began in her childhood. The daughter of a pioneer of New Mexico's statehood, she was born and raised in the remote pueblo of Abiquiu in the foothills of the Valle Grande mountains. It was there that she absorbed the atmosphere of Hispanic-American culture.         She was educated at Barnard College and graduated from Columbia University's School of Journalism in 1918. She also received extensive tutoring in economics, political science, music and the arts. A Museum Founder         She was a founder in 1923 of the Nicholas Roerich Museum in Manhattan, under whose auspices she went to the Far East and wrote about the philosophies and cultures of India and Tibet. She served as a vice president of the museum until 1937.         Miss Grant first visited Latin America in 1929 and after that devoted most of her energy to the republics of the hemisphere. She lectured at virtually all of its universities and centers of learning and started some of the first cultural interchanges, including exhibitions, musical programs and public forums.         Her work was primarily responsible for the Roerich Pact, an inter-American agreement for the preservation of cultural sites signed at the White House by 21 republics in 1935. She founded the Pan American Women's Association in 1930 and the Inter-American Association for Democracy and Freedom in 1950 and headed both of them into her late 80's. A Journal Editor         From 1951 until the mid-1980's, she edited the English and Spanish editions of Hemispherica, a journal published by the Inter-American Association. For this she received a special citation in 1982 at Columbia University from the trustees of the annual Maria Moors Cabot prizes in inter-American journalism.         Recognized as a leader in the defense of civil and politcal liberties, she was a past chairman of the Latin American section and secretary of the International League for Human Rights. The league is a nongovernmental agency accredited by the United Nations whose predecessors date back to the Dreyfus affair in France nearly a century ago.         Jose Figueres Ferrer, then the President of Costa Rica and himself a resolute champion of democracy, paid tribute to Miss Grant in a public address in New York in 1951. He called her "the greatest fighter for democracy and human rights in the hemisphere."       
         Caroline Klein Simon, who overcame early obstacles to women in the legal profession to become a pioneering female judge, politician, state official and champion of laws against discrimination in jobs and housing, died yesterday at home. She was 92 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a heart attack, her family said.         Judge Simon, who was still active as a lawyer at her death, served in state posts under appointments from both Republican and Democratic governors and was the first woman nominated by a major party for citywide office in New York City.         She helped draft the nation's first state law barring job discrimination and later led the nation in imposing regulations against racial "block busting" by real-estate brokers.         Judge Simon's credo was simple. "I am against discrimination in any form," she said.         During her own career, she faced discrimination from the very beginning.         She was rejected for admission to Columbia University's law school in the 1920's because it did not have toilets and other accommodations for female students, her family said. So she earned her law degree at New York University instead. Failed Search for Paying Job         After graduation, despite her strong academic record and passing the bar examination, she was turned down by every firm where she applied to become a law clerk. She finally offered to work free for a year "to convince them that a woman could be a lawyer," she later recalled.         Greenbaum, Wolff & Ernst took her up and after the year was up she was offered a permanent job. But she decided instead to work for indigent clients and family planning groups.         Three decades later, she was a leading candidate to become the Postmaster of New York in 1958 but was vetoed by Federal officials. The New York Times reported, based on officials close to the Postmaster General, "Opposition to the appointment of Mrs. Caroline K. Simon was based on the ground that the job was unsuited to a woman."         In a widely quoted speech the next year, she said: "There are four things a woman needs to know. She needs to know how to look like a girl, act like a lady, think like a man and work like a dog." Worked Under Dewey         Her public service began in the 1930's when she was instrumental in changing state laws to entitle women to serve as jurors and was herself among the first called for service.         District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey of Manhattan named her to a panel on revising the Domestic Relations Court Act. During World War II she served as the Office of Civilian Defense's director of group activities in New York, New Jersey and Delaware.         Mr. Dewey, by then Governor, appointed her to the New York State Workers' Compensation Board in 1944-45 and the temporary State War Council's Committee on Discrimination in Employment in 1943-45.         Eager to continue the fight against discrimination, she helped draft the nation's first state law on job bias based on race, religion or nationality and became a founding member of the resulting State Commission Against Discrimination. City Council Race         In 1956, Gov. W. Averell Harriman, a Democrat, appointed her to the new State Youth Commission.         The next year she ran for City Council President as a Republican. Although she lost to Abe Stark by about two-to-one, she still ran some 100,000 votes ahead of her ticket and received the biggest total for a citywide Republican candidate.         In 1958 she served as the legal advisor to the American delegation to the United Nations Human Rights Commission.         In 1959 Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller, a Republican, inducted her as New York's Secretary of State, the second woman to hold that post. It was in that role that she issued the nation's first regulations against block busting, in which brokers manipulated property owners' fears about racial or ethnic changes in the neighborhood to provoke sales.         It was her marriage to Leopold K. Simon, a lawyer, that ignited her interest in the law.         They divorced in the early 1950's. She remarried, to Irving W. Halpern, the chief probation officer of the Court of General Sessions, who died in 1966.         Her survivors include her son, Lee K., of Wilmington, N.C.; a daughter, Cathy Prince of White Plains; a brother, Nathan F. Klein of Titusville, Fla.; five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.         A service will be held at 11 A.M. Sunday at Temple Emanu-El on Fifth Avenue at 65th Street in Manhattan.       
         Sophia Yarnall Jacobs, a lifelong advocate of civil and human rights, died on Wednesday at her home on Mount Desert Island in Northeast Harbor, Me. She was 91.         Her daughter, Charlton Yarnall Phelps, said the cause was congestive heart failure.         Mrs. Jacobs was former president of the Urban League of Greater New York and the National Council of Women. She was active in the Urban League movement for more than 20 years and served as vice president and trustee of the National Urban League.         As head of the league's chapter for Greater New York from 1955 to 1960, she fought school segregation, pressed for more public housing on vacant land sites and led action for legislation barring racial discrimination in private housing.  Headed Women's Council         In 1959, Mrs. Jacobs took part in the first "woman-to-woman" exchange between the United States and the Soviet Union. She became president of the National Council of Women in 1960 and was chairwoman of the 75th anniversary of the International Council of Women and the national affiliate, in Washington in 1963.         Born in Haverford, Pa., she attended Bryn Mawr College for two years. In 1921, she married Reginald Robert Jacobs, a Philadelphia banker. The marriage ended in divorce in 1937.         While in Philadelphia, she wrote many articles of interest to women, published in Good Housekeeping, Country Life, Harper's Bazaar, Parents, Reader's Digest and other magazines. From 1937 to 1945, she served as executive secretary of the Philadelphia Orchestra Club and then became promotion manager of the Philadelphia Orchestra. Wrote Historical Novel         In 1945, she went to San Francisco as an observer at the birth of the United Nations.         Mrs. Jacobs moved to New York in 1954, where she was an officer of numerous civic and educational organizations. She was active in the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Committee on Africa, Howard University, Planned Parenthood-World Population and the Rachel Carson Trust for the Living Environment.         She was the author of a historical novel, "The Clark Inheritance," based on her family's history in the develpment of the coal mines of Pennsylvania. She is remembered by many as Sophy, the group leader, in her friend Emily Kimbrough's book, "Pleasure by the Busload."         Besides her daughter, who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by a son, Denholm Muir Jacobs of Northeast Harbor; 6 grandchildren, and 12 great-grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth M. Ramsey, whose discovery of a two-week-old embryo during an autopsy began her career as an authority on human embryology, died Friday at a hospital in Washington. She was 87 and lived in Washington.         The cause was a stroke, said the Carnegie Institution of Washington. Dr.  Ramsey worked for 36 years for Carnegie's embryology department on the Johns Hopkins University campus in Baltimore.         Dr. James Ebert, vice president of the National Academy of Science, called Dr. Ramsey "the world's leading student of the anatomy of the placenta."         She won the distinguished service award of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and was named to its hall of fame. In 1987 the Society for Gynecologic Investigation named her its distinguished scientist of the year. She was also a past vice president of the American Association of Anatomists. The Yale Embryo         While conducting a routine autopsy as a pathologist at Yale Medical School in the 1930's, she and her colleagues discovered a 14-day-old embryo. It was believed to be the youngest human embryo studied and came to be known as the Yale Embryo.         "It was the most interesting professional thing in my life," she once recalled.         The discovery led her to publish research on the anatomy of human embryos. Then she began studying monkeys to understand the circulatory system of their embryos and placentas. Later, working with Martin Donner of the radiology department at Johns Hopkins, she used radioactive dyes and X-rays to disclose that the human embryo and placenta have a similar circulation system.         She wrote more than 125 scientific articles and two books, "The Placenta of Laboratory Animals and Man" (1975) and, with Mr. Donner, "Placental Vasculature and Circulation" (1982).         Dr. Ramsey taught and lectured at Johns Hopkins and Georgetown and George Washington Universities and served on the Dean's Council of Yale Medical School. She retired about 20 years ago.         She also served on the boards of the National Symphony Orchestra and the National Cathedral Choral Society.         Born in New York City, Dr. Ramsey grew up in California and graduated from Mills College in 1928. She studied in Hamburg, Germany, then at Yale Medical School, where she graduated in 1932 as one of two women in her class.         For 59 years she was married to Hans Klagsbrunn, a lawyer, who died on June 23. Together they ran a dairy and pig farm in Loudoun County, Va.         She is survived by a brother, Charles C. Ramsey Jr. of Big Timber, Mont.       
         Florence Cooper, a Manhattan community organizer of child-care and women's-support services, died on Saturday at Beth Israel Hospital. She was 84 and lived in Washington Heights.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Cooper, who remained active until her death, was the membership chairwoman of the Upper West Manhattan branch of the League of Women Voters. She served on the boards of Fort George Head Start and the Napeague Institute of Art in Amagansett, L.I.         She played a key role in Womanspace, a program devoted to women's support services at Columbia University. An amateur painter, she served as administrator of the art school at the Museum at the Museum of Modern Art in the 1970's and held private art classes for children.         Born in Brooklyn, she graduated from Adelphi College and earned a master's degree in comparative literature at Columbia University.         Mrs. Cooper's husband, Rudolf, a high school teacher, died in 1968.         She is survived by a daughter, Constance Cooper Batuscheck of Alexandria, Va.; a son, Kenneth, of Manhattan; a brother, David Buxbaum of Milwaukee, and a grandson.       
         Elisabeth Draper, an interior designer in New York for 60 years, died in her sleep at her home in Manhattan on Monday. She was 93.         John R. Taylor Jr., one of Mrs. Draper's grandnephews, said she had been in declining health for the last four years.         Mrs. Draper was one of the grande dames of decorating in an era when a professionally decorated home was a mark of privilege.         She became known for comfortable rooms that mixed antiques with contemporary furnishings.         In 1967, she said: "I came along in that lovely ladies' era of decorating and just before all the talented men began emerging in the field."         Self-taught, Mrs. Draper was responsible for the decor of countless country houses, city apartments and houses as well as executive suites in banks.         She was born Elisabeth Carrington Frank in New York City in 1900, the daughter of Charles and Louise Frank. Mr. Frank was a banker. She attended Miss Spence's School but left before her graduation in 1918 to be trained as a radio operator 1st class, and served in that capacity until the end of World War I. Eisenhowers Were Clients         Soon after the war, she married Seth Low, a banker. When the couple were divorced in 1929, Mrs. Draper began her career in decorating with her sister Tiffany Taylor, establishing a firm called Taylor & Low.         In 1935, she married Dr. George Draper, an internist and specialist in psychosomatic medicine. In 1936, Mrs. Draper established her business under her own name.         Mrs. Draper was prominent in the Long Island social world for decades. President and Mrs. Dwight D. Eisenhower were among her numerous clients. She decorated their New York home as well as the Eisenhower farmhouse in Gettysburg, Pa.         She decorated the American Embassy in Paris for Ambassador Amory Houghton, worked on a number of rooms at the White House, and did the interiors of Blair House. The Old Merchant's House on East Fourth Street in Manhattan was restored under her direction.         Mrs. Draper is survived by her son, Seth Low Jr., of Syosset, L.I., and her stepdaughter, Penelope Buchanan of Cleveland.         The funeral will be tomorrow at 11 A.M. at St. James's Church, at Madison Avenue and 71st Street.       
         Helen Kaplan, who devoted her life to helping retarded children and making the public aware of their needs, died on Wednesday at Central General Hospital in Plainview, L.I. A resident of Old Westbury, she was 82.         She suffered a brief illness, her family said.         Mrs. Kaplan was a founder and charter member of the Association for the Help of Retarded Children, Nassau County Chapter. She served as its secretary, vice president and president, and finally, from 1961 until 1988, as its executive director. After that, she continued to attend functions and maintained an active interest in the organization until her death.         In the late 1940's retarded children had few opportunities in education, training or recreation. This led to the birth of the association in New York City in 1949. News quickly spread to Long Island and the Nassau chapter sprang up the same year. Son Died of Leukemia         Mrs. Kaplan's first child, David, was retarded, and died of leukemia at the age of 9 in 1952, two years after she opened the fledgling association's first day camp for 24 children. In 1950 she started a demonstration training program, which she ran for eight years.         She became the guiding force behind the growth of the Nassau Association for the Help of Retarded Children, whose more than 8,000 members support educational, vocational, residential and other programs to serve 1,400 children and adults and their families. She spent 11 years as a full-time volunteer until the death of her husband, Allan, in 1960, when she joined the salaried staff.         The New York association now has chapters in nearly every county and sister organizations across the country. The statewide group, Nysarc Inc., belongs to the Arc of the United States.         Mrs. Kaplan grew up in Philadelphia. She graduated from the Philadelphia Conservatory of Music and was an accomplished pianist.         She sat on several influential committees and received many honors. Among them was the first Helen Award, created by a State Commissioner of Mental Health, Alan Miller, and named after her.         Mrs. Kaplan is survived by another son, Michael, of Manhattan, and a grandson.       
         Dr. Wilma Thompson Donahue, an expert in the psychology of aging and director emeritus of the University of Michigan Institute of Gerontology, died on Tuesday at her home in Ann Arbor. She was 92.         She had had a long illness, the university reported.         Dr. Donahue was among the country's first clinical psychologists when she began her career at Ann Arbor in 1935 as a practitioner of the branch of psychology that deals with the diagnosis, treatment and prevention of personality and behavior problems. Her reputation widened in the 1950's as her name appeared in journals and books on housing, medical care and other subjects concerning the elderly.         She served on state commissions on aging and was founding president of the Michigan Society of Gerontology. Ten years ago, she was in the first group inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame.         Nationally, Dr. Donahue took part in White House Conferences on Aging in 1961, 1971 and 1981 and was a member of related policy boards for Presidents Harry S. Truman, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson, Richard M. Nixon and Jimmy Carter. She served for 10 years as director of the International Center for Social Gerontology in Washington, a post she left 10 years ago.         Born in Mitchellville, Iowa, she earned three degrees in psychology at the University of Michigan, including a doctorate in 1937. She practiced at the mental hygiene clinic of the Student Health Service starting in 1935 and was appointed an instructor in the department of psychology three years later.         In 1951, she became the founding director of the university's division of gerontology and took the same position at the transformed Institute of Gerontology in 1966. She retired in 1970.         At the time, the university's Regents cited her ultimate mission as apolitical and purely educational: "She sought to elicit the truth about old people, especially those distressed in mind, body, or estate."         Dr. Donahue's husband, Lester, died in 1963 after 41 years of marriage.       
         Alison Raymond Lanier, who made a career of untangling the confusions that foreign posts might pose for American career women, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 76.         She was the author of a series of books explaining the ways of overseas cultures. But since such exchanges are a two-way street, she also wrote books to help foreigners sort out the mysterious ways of American society.         Thus, her "Living in the U.S.A." (Scribner, 1973) was translated into half a dozen languages, including Arabic, Japanese and Chinese. Her last book, "The Rising Sun on Main Street: Working with the Japanese" (International Information Press, 1990), sought to help Americans puzzled by the customs of Japanese living among them.         Her 11 books included an "Update" series that went through several editions, most of them issued by her own company, Overseas Briefing Associates, and by Intercultural Press. They ranged from "Update -- Britain" to "Update -- Venezuela". Graduate of Bryn Mawr         Mrs. Lanier, a native of Manhattan, was a 1938 honors graduate of Bryn Mawr College, for which she did public-relations work in the early 1940's. In World War II, she served in the United States Navy Women's Reserve, retiring in 1946 as a commander.         In the 1950's she traveled widely as executive director of the foundation-supported Committee of Correspondence, which worked to make women into leaders in their countries' development. These experiences prompted her first book, "Half the World's People" (Apoleton-Century-Crofts, 1965). After that she directed hospitality programs at the United Nations for the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.         In 1967 she founded Overseas Briefing Associates. It provided seminars for corporations and organizations increasingly active overseas and ready to dispatch personnel into unfamiliar territory. The briefings went over the difficulties facing women, whose chances of foreign assignments were just opening up.         Two years ago she organized a volunteer service to help newcomers from the former Soviet bloc to tackle English and adjust to life in America.         Mrs. Lanier's husband, Albert G., died last September.         She is survived by a sister, Audrey McMahon of Lawrenceville, N.J., and a brother, Edward A. Raymond of North Branford, Conn.       
         Miriam Irene Eolis, a lawyer, accountant and theatrical producer, died Wednesday at St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx. She was 80.         The cause was complications from a recent fall, her family said.         She was a graduate of Hunter College and one of the first women to graduate from St. John's University School of Law. She also held a graduate degree in tax law from Columbia University and was a certified public accountant.         Ms. Eolis was a tax consultant in private practice and served on the faculty of the New York University Tax Institute and Pace University. She also was treasurer and president of the New York State Society of Public Accountants.         She had a lifelong interest in the theater and toured Europe with the Pegasus Players and was a producer of the Westchester County, Yonkers and Kennebunkport playhouses for 10 years.         She was married to Alexander L. Eolis and, after his death, married Mortimer M. Kassell. They later divorced.         She is survived by three daughters, Sharon and Wendeen of Manhattan, and Susan Kassell of Potomac, Md.       
         Joan Walden Fleischman, a social worker who specialized in working with families with abused or neglected children, died on Monday at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. She was 61 and lived in Glen Rock, N.J.         The cause was leukemia, her family said.         Mrs. Fleischman was a social worker at the Family Life Center of Hackensack Hospital from 1980 to 1985, working with troubled families. She was later a social worker for the National Institutes of Health.         She served on the oversight board of the Anne Frank House for homeless women in Washington, D.C. She was also active in the National Museum for Women in the Arts and the Glen Rock League of Women Voters.         Mrs. Flesichman was born in Boston and grew up in Jamaica Plain and Brookline, Mass.         She was married for nearly 40 years to Edward H. Fleischman, a lawyer in Manhattan and former member of the Securities and Exchange Commission. Her other survivors include a son, Charles of Chevy Chase, Md.; a daughter, Janet of Tacoma Park, Md.; a brother, Stephen Walden of Rye, N.Y.; two sisters, Elinor Wharton of New York City and Beth Greenblatt of Teaneck, N.J., and one grandson.       
         Olivia L. Gilliam, a foundation executive, died on Sunday at her home in Great Barrington, Mass. She was 55 and also lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         For the last 20 years, Mrs. Gilliam was the executive director of the Myrin Institute, a foundation whose causes include international affairs, the environment and drug-abuse education through its offshoot, the American Council for Drug Research. Through Myrin, she was a founding editor and the artistic director of the Orion Society's Orion Nature Quarterly.         She worked with the Office of the Tibetan Mission to the United Nations in the 1960's.

Ladd of Brewster, Mass.; a half sister, Cornelia Goode of Melbourne, Australia; two stepbrothers, Geoffrey and Eric DeBellaigue, both of London, and a stepsister, Cornelia Schwartz of Harrisville, N.H.       
         Joan Walden Fleischman, a social worker who specialized in working with families with abused or neglected children, died on Monday at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle.

         Muriel R. Carbery, a retired nursing school dean and hospital nursing director, died on Tuesday at home in Port Jefferson, L.I. She was 81.         From 1952 to 1974 Miss Carbery served as the director of the nursing service at New York Hospital. From 1958 to 1970 held the dual post of dean of the Cornell University-New York Hospital School of Nursing.         After stepping down as dean, she continued as a professor and associate dean of the nursing school's continuing education division.         Miss Carbery, a native of Brooklyn, graduated from Hunter College, where she trained to become a teacher of Greek and Latin. Because of the scarcity of jobs in the Depression, she worked briefly in a library, then decided to become a nurse and combine that profession with teaching. She graduated from New York Hospital School of Nursing in 1937 and later earned a master's degree in nursing education at Catholic University.         Her first nursing job, at New York Hospital, paid $65 a month plus board and room for a 48-hour week. She worked in surgery and private nursing and started teaching in 1940.         During World War II she served four years in the United States Army Nurse Corps in the Pacific. Her assignments included working in a 600-bed tent and tin-roof hospital in the jungles of New Guinea and in a 2,500-bed hospital in West New Guinea that was bombed in the fighting during Gen. Douglas MacArthur's return to the Philippines.         She reached the rank of major during active duty and retired from the reserve in 1970 as a colonel.         She is survived by a sister, Mary Morgan, of Marietta, Ga.       
         Irma Lazarus, a patron and an advocate of the arts, died on Aug. 26 at her home in Cincinnati. She was 80.         The cause was amyloidosis, a cancer-causing blood disorder, a family spokesman said.         Mrs. Lazarus founded the Ohio Arts Council in 1965 and was its chairwoman from 1973 to 1975. She also served on the boards of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, the Cincinnati Ballet, the Cincinnati Opera and the American Symphony Orchestra League.         The opening concerts of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra seasons will be dedicated to her memory.         For 35 years she appeared on television in an informal interview program called "Conversations With Irma," which was carried on Channel 48 in Cincinnati, one of the country's first public television stations.         Her friends included leaders of the performing arts, particularly in the music world. She also was active as a fund raiser for AIDS-relief volunteers of Cincinnati.         She was awarded the 1993 Ohio Arts Council's Governor's award for a half-century of leadership in the arts.         Mrs. Lazarus, whose maiden name was Mendelsohn, was born in Brooklyn. She was graduated from Smith College in 1934.         She is survived by her husband, Fred Lazarus 3d, and their three children: Fred 4th, of Baltimore; Eleanor, of Watertown, Mass., and Margaret Crawford of Rhinebeck, N.Y.; a sister, Eleanor Strauss of Cincinnati; and two children by her previous marriage, to George Rau: Elizabeth Bloch of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., and George Rau Jr. of Crested Butte, Colo.       
         Lillian Ruth Kessler, founder of the Kessler International Corporation, which exports railroad parts, electronics and heavy industrial equipment to Asia, Africa and South America, died last Saturday at a nursing home in Washington. She was 85.         Her daughter, Elinor Fuchs, said her mother had Alzheimer's disease.         Ms. Kessler founded the company in 1946. It is now based in Rockville, Md.         Before she established the business Ms. Kessler served for a year as an analyst for the Foreign Economic Administration, a Federal agency, conducting studies of postwar industrialization in Ethiopia and China. She then worked as an industrial economist for an international engineering firm and as a foreign markets consultant for the Sinclair Oil Corporation. W.P.A. History Project         While still a doctoral student in economic history in what is now Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ms. Kessler was asked to direct a pilot history project for the Works Progress Administration, the New Deal program established in 1935 to provide employment through public works projects; eventually, the history project grew into the W.P.A.'s Historical Records Survey.         Ms. Kessler was named the director of the project for Ohio in 1939. During her work with the W.P.A. she wrote a guidebook to American folk songs, "Songs of Yesterday: A Song Anthology of American Life," with Philip D. Jordan.         She was born in Cleveland and attended Radcliffe College before enrolling at the Cleveland university, where she received an undergraduate degree in 1929.         In 1930 she married Joseph Fuchs, the violinist, who was then with the Cleveland Orchestra. They divorced in 1940.         Besides her daughter, Ms. Kessler is survived by a brother, Dr. Edwin S. Kessler of Washington, and two granddaughters.       
         Joan R. Sovern, a sculptor, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 57.         She died of cancer, said her husband, Michael, who stepped down in June as president of Columbia University.         Mrs. Sovern, who was born and grew up in Manhattan, majored in art at Bennington College. She later studied sculpture with William Zorach and John Hovannes at the Art Students League. Her early works were large abstract pieces in bronze, terra cotta and marble, but in recent years she turned to assemblage, making small, angular forms out of slate, stone and driftwood. She had solo exhibitions at the Nora Haime Gallery in 1988 and the Kouros Gallery in 1991.         Mrs. Sovern also served on the Columbia Art History Advisory Council and helped create the Henry Moore Sculpture Reserve at Columbia's campus in Harriman, N.Y.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a brother, Edward Rosenthal of Croton-on-Hudson, N.Y.; a daughter, Hannah Wit of Oakland, Calif.; a son, David Wit of Manhattan; two stepdaughters, Julie Sovern of New York City and Elizabeth Sovern of Mount Kisco, N.Y.; two stepsons, Jeffrey Sovern of Queens and Douglas Sovern of Oakland, and four grandchildren.       
         Charlotte Catherine Campbell, a retired professor who advanced the knowledge and treatment of infections caused by fungi, died on Friday at Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston. A Boston resident, she was 78.         She had had a brief illness, said a spokesman for J. S. Waterman & Sons funeral homes in Boston.         A specialist in medical mycology, the study of fungi, Professor Campbell wrote or was the co-author of more than 100 treatises, particularly on the causes and cures of histoplasmosis, lung diseases caused by fungus. For her work, she received the highest award of the International Society for Human and Animal Mycology in 1979. Although she never finished her doctorate, this was one of many honors she received.         Born on a farm near Winchester, Va., she became fascinated with fungi that form in garden soil and get into the blood, brain and lungs of humans, where the fungi grow and cause trouble. She told an interviewer after the 1979 award that the fungi "are molds like the ones that grow on bread in the fridge or on damp shoes in the closet."         She trained at Ohio State University, American University, George Washington University and Duke University as well as on the job as a microbiologist. In 1948, she became chief of medical mycology at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Washington.         She left in 1962 to become an associate professor of medical mycology at Harvard University's School of Public Health and advanced to full professor in 1970. Three years later she accepted an appointment as professor of medical sciences at Southern Illinois University and also served as department chairwoman from 1974 until her academic retirement in 1977.         She then worked on foreign-student exchanges for the American Society of Microbiology in what was then the Soviet Union for three years. More recently, she worked as a volunteer at Brigham & Women's Hospital and with battered women in the Boston area.         Professor Campbell is survived by a sister, Elizabeth Flint of Daytona Beach, Fla.       
         Peggy Dennis, a Communist organizer and author, died on Sept. 25 at the Jewish Home for the Aged in San Francisco. She was 84.         The cause was complications from several strokes, said her son, Eugene Dennis Vrana.         Ms. Dennis was the wife of Eugene Dennis, general secretary of the American Communist Party from 1946 to 1959 and one of 12 American Communists jailed in the late 1940's for violating the Smith Act by conspiring to overthrow the Government. Ms. Dennis worked mostly in internal party organizing and for many years served as a courier of messages to Communist leaders in Germany, Poland, France and other countries.         After 1949, she worked primarily as a journalist at The Daily Worker and The People's World. She also wrote many freelance articles on politics and economics for socialist and liberal magazines including The Progressive and The Nation. She moved to San Francisco in 1961 after Mr. Dennis died.         In 1977, a year after she resigned from the Communist Party because of differences with its leadership, she wrote a book based on her experiences as an organizer, "The Autobiography of an American Communist: A Personal View of a Political Life."         A documentary about her life with Mr. Dennis, called "Love in the Cold War," was produced in 1991 by American Experience and Windfall Films and shown on public television in 1992.         Ms. Dennis is survived by two sons, Mr. Vrana of San Francisco and Timur Timofeev of Moscow, and a niece, Laura Bock of San Francisco.       
         Audrey Triolo, an advocate for the elderly and poor in the Greenwich, Conn., area who directed a food bank and an organization that developed affordable housing, died on Oct. 14 at her home in Riverside, Conn. She was 60.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         From 1987 to 1992 Mrs. Triolo was director of the Food Bank of Lower Fairfield County, which supplied food to about 50 agencies in Greenwich, Stamford, Norwalk, Darien and New Canaan. From 1983 to 1986, she was executive director of the Greenwich Housing Coalition, a nonprofit organization that built low-cost housing.         She had served in numerous humanitarian organizations since moving to the Greenwich area with her husband in 1967. In recognition of her volunteerism, Greenwich officials declared a day in her honor in the city on Sept. 20.         Mrs. Triolo was born in Minneapolis and graduated cum laude from Smith College in 1954.         She is survived by her husband, Peter; two sons, Stuart, of Seattle and Bruce, of Fort Collins, Colo.; two daughters, Ellen Uebele of Eden Prairie, Minn., and Leslie Franks of Portland, Ore., and six grandchildren.       
         Beryl Emmer Menon, a journalist who edited the staff newspaper of Unicef, the United Nations relief organization, and who traveled and wrote widely in India and the Himalayas, died on Oct. 19 at her home in Manhattan. She was 50.         She had decided to discontinue kidney dialysis after 19 years of treatment, friends said.         Ms. Menon began her career as a freelance writer and photographer in Asia in the late 1960's after graduating with a journalism degree from New York University. She was a contributor to Ms. magazine, The Calcutta Statesman and The Bengali-American Reporter, taking assignments in Sikkim, Nepal and the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, which was then closed to outsiders by order of the Indian Government.         Indian officials began proceedings to deport Ms. Menon from Calcutta because of her violation of the travel ban, but she was allowed to remain after she married Bhaskar P. Menon, then a columnist for The Calcutta Statesman.         She returned to New York with her husband in 1970 and for the next three years worked as a reporter for The Record of Bergen County, N.J. In 1973, after learning she had kidney disease, she decided to travel again, to Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan.         In 1986, she became editor of Staff News, which is distributed to Unicef's employees around the world. She served in this position until last year.         She is survived by two brothers, William Kartel of Lake Ronkonkoma, L.I., and Ted Kartofsky of Manhattan, and a sister, Sandra Kartfel of San Francisco.       
         Dr. Dorothy Borg, a Columbia University historian of United States-East Asian relations, died last Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.         Her family said she had had a brief illness.         From 1966 until her retirement several years ago, Dr. Borg was a senior research associate at Columbia's East Asian Institute, lecturing and directing academic conferences. She served as a mentor to generations of scholars since the 1940's when she was associated with the American Institute of Pacific Relations.         She was the author or editor of a number of books, including "The United States and the Far Eastern Crisis, 1933-1938" (Harvard University Press, 1965), for which Columbia awarded her its Bancroft Prize in American History. Based on research in personal papers of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and high officials dealing with East Asian affairs, it chronicled events leading to Pearl Harbor, starting with Japan's invasion of Manchuria.         She was the co-editor, with Waldo Heinrichs, of "Uncertain Years: Chinese American Relations, 1947-1950" (Columbia University Press, 1980), which remains in print. Defended Targets of McCarthy         A native of Elberon, N.J., she graduated from Wellesley College and earned master's and doctoral degrees at Columbia University. She spent two years in Beijing and Shanghai in the 1940's as a staff member of the American Council of the Institute of Pacific Relations.         A few years later, the Institute was a target of a campaign by Senator Joseph R. McCarthy to find out "who lost China" to the Communists. Dr. Borg set aside her career for some time to help defend Owen Lattimore, the historian, and other colleagues who came under fire from the Senator.         Before she joined the institute at Columbia, she was a researcher at Harvard University where she helped organize area programs that, starting in the 1960's, trained scholars in American and East Asian history.         Dr. Borg is survived by two nephews, John Loengard of New York City and Richard Loengard of Basking Ridge, N.J.       
         Doris Duke, the tobacco heiress and philanthropist whose bittersweet life was woven of luxury, disputes and interludes of deep unhappiness, died yesterday at her house in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 80 and had her main residence in Somerset County, N.J. She also had homes on Park Avenue in midtown Manhattan, in Newport, R.I., and Hawaii.         The cause was progressive pulmonary edema resulting in cardiac arrest, said Howard J. Rubenstein, a spokesman for Bernard Lafferty, a friend and adviser to Miss Duke who was with her at her death.         Her manifold interests as a philanthropist ranged from animal rights to AIDS, historical preservation to orchids. By some accounts she was an astute manager of her assets, and a person familiar with her affairs said that she had left nearly all her estate of more than $1 billion to charity.         Late one evening in Rome in 1945, Miss Duke, who was then 33 years old, told a friend that her vast fortune was in some ways a barrier to happiness.         "All that money is a problem sometimes," Miss Duke told her companion, a young American journalist, over a glass of wine at the Hassler Hotel. "It happens every time. After I've gone out with a man a few times, he starts to tell me how much he loves me. But how can I know if he really means it? How can I ever be sure?" An Inheritance With a Double Edge         At that stage of her life, Miss Duke, then between marriages and working as a foreign correspondent based in Rome, was known and liked by other American expatriates for her friendly, unassuming ways, her warmth, and her love of jazz and ballroom dancing. But her words that night showed that her life had been profoundly affected, even scarred, by her wealth.         Miss Duke was not only rich; she was also thought for years to be the richest woman in the world. And she had that reputation during the Depression, when her wealth stood out in especially stark contrast to widespread poverty and suffering. As a result, she was always a celebrity, and one who literally stood out, standing six feet one inch tall.         Her millions, and the elegant life they made possible, seemed to be of great importance to her two husbands, James H. R. Cromwell, an American sportsman and advertising man, and Porfirio Rubirosa, a Dominican playboy and diplomat. She divorced them both.         The Duke millions also attracted cranks and photographers and ordinary curious people, and to avoid them Miss Duke lived a partly secluded life in her later years. In recent years, she traveled extensively and spent much time in Somerville, Newport, Hawaii and Beverly Hills. A Generous Giver With Many Interests         Her many philanthropic activities included paying for the restoration of numerous old buildings in Newport. She also established the Duke Gardens Foundation at Somerville in 1958. The Duke Gardens' trellised greenhouses, open to the public part of each year, contain French, English, Italian, Chinese, Japanese, Indian and Islamic gardens and a collection of rare orchids.         As a philanthropist, Miss Duke was also active in support of environmental causes and animal rights. This year she contributed $2 million for AIDS research at Duke University in Durham, N.C., which was named for her family, and $1 million to the Elizabeth Taylor AIDS Foundation.         In addition, she was the president of the Doris Duke Foundation, based in Somerville, whose areas of interest have ranged from social and health services to cultural programs. The foundation reported $775,000 in charitable contributions in the 1992 fiscal year.         The president of Duke University, Nannerl O. Keohane, said yesterday, in a statement released by the university, that Miss Duke's "recent gift in support of AIDS research at Duke is but one of many programs here that she supported, from our Primate Center to other programs across the campus." She added: "Many of her gifts were made anonymously."         A spokesman for the university, John F. Burness, declined to say what, if anything, it might receive from Miss Duke's estate.         In an act of personal generosity in 1988 that involved an old friend, Miss Duke posted $5 million bail for Imelda Marcos, the wife of the former Philippine president, Ferdinand Marcos, who died in 1989. Mrs. Marcos had been indicted in New York on Federal racketeering charges.         At various times, Miss Duke's millions, and the publicity they generated, also helped to draw her into lawsuits and disputes, including tax litigation in New Jersey, the site of her 2,700-acre estate, Duke Farms. In 1964, she took legal action in Hawaii to obtain a court order forbidding a jazz musician, Joseph Castro, from maintaining, as had been rumored, that he was her husband. A Bomber for Travel And Clean Kitchens         Her fortune also made possible many pleasures, large and small. She once bought a B-25 bomber and had it refurbished for luxury travel. She had her Hawaii house fixed up with ceiling-high goldfish tanks.         She entertained gracefully there and at her various other residences and tried to put shy guests at their ease. As a hostess, she was calm, quiet and a little shy herself, friends said, although she was sometimes angered by sloppiness in the kitchen, as in other realms.         Miss Duke liked fine porcelain and jewels and enjoyed building her jewelry collection, which included notable Indian pieces and heirlooms from her mother. She liked to bake, and friends said her whole-wheat bread was delicious. She enjoyed relaxing, now and then, with a glass of white wine or a spot of Champagne.         Nonetheless, Miss Duke seemed to experience more than her share of unhappiness. Beyond the two divorces, there was the death of her father, the multimillionaire James Buchanan Duke, in 1925, when she was 12 years old. In July 1940, her premature daughter, her only child, died in a Honolulu hospital after only 24 hours of life.         And in 1966 there was the accidental death of Eduardo Tirella, an interior decorator who was a close friend, when the car she was driving slammed him against a gate on Rough Point, the Newport estate. Fenced with barbed wire and guarded, Rough Point was part of her inheritance from her father, known as Buck, who was president of the American Tobacco Company and had other extensive business interests. A Father's Fortune And a Young Heir         What made Miss Duke so enormously rich was the fact that she was his only child. She was born in Manhattan on Nov. 22, 1912, to his second wife, Nanaline Lee Holt Inman Duke.         Miss Duke, a shy, golden-haired child, had private tutors and for a time attended the Brearley School in Manhattan, where her father had built a three-story, 54-room mansion on the northeast corner of 78th Street and Fifth Avenue. The building now houses the Fine Arts Institute of New York University.         When Mr. Duke died, his total estate was valued at more than $100 million. His daughter's share of the estate was appraised in 1927 at more than $50 million, most of it in trust funds.         As a teen-ager and a young woman, Miss Duke spent much of her time at the 78th Street mansion, to which she sometimes referred jauntily in later years as "the rock pile." She took piano lessons, was tutored in French and Italian, went out to dinner at fashionable restaurants, and frequently went to the theater, although to avoid crowds she did not go to opening nights.         She also acquired a love of travel that was to stay with her through her life.         Miss Duke, who was known to some as Dee-Dee, was guarded by private detectives and sometimes traveled under an assumed name. "It saves trouble," she once said, "and keeps people from paying more attention to me than to anyone else."         Nevertheless, she was continually harassed by cranks, and there was some fear that she might be kidnapped.         Her half-brother, Walker Patterson Inman, who often traveled with her, once said: "Everywhere we go, it's the same. She gets to see a few of the sights, goes out to dinner a few times, and then her identity becomes known and we have to rush off somewhere else. We can't take any chances. When word gets out that she's in town, it's like telling gangsters: 'Here's a lot of money. Come and get it.' "         "But that's not the worst of it," he added. "Mail comes in by the bagful, and every crank in town wants to see her. Every imaginable plea for money comes by mail, to say nothing of threats against her because she's supposed to have so much money."         In hopes of seeing her, reporters gathered outside the 78th Street mansion on the evening of Nov. 21, 1933, but she eluded them and slipped out for a quiet dinner with friends. What made that night newsworthy, it was reported at the time, was that at the stroke of midnight, when she turned 21, she acquired control of one-third of the assets that had been held in trust for her.         Although no precise figures were released, it was estimated that the total value of her inheritance had shrunk by then, because of the financial crash and the Depression, to roughly $30 million. As stipulated in her father's will, Miss Duke acquired control over additional large parts of her inheritance on her 25th and 30th birthdays. Tobacco Queen As Married Woman         Soon after turning 21, Miss Duke began being seen in the company of a dashing, strong-jawed older man. It was James Cromwell, the son and grandson of prominent yachtsmen and the stepson of a partner in the banking house of J. P. Morgan & Company.         Mr. Cromwell and Miss Duke had first met in 1929 in Bar Harbor, Me., when she was a long-legged teen-ager and he was already 10 years out of the University of Pennsylvania.         Rumors of an engagement blossomed, were denied, blossomed again. And then, with little advance notice, the couple were married in a civil ceremony on Feb. 13, 1935, in the 78th Street house. The bride was 22, the groom 38. They sailed off on a prolonged honeymoon.         Visiting Agra, the Indian city that is the site of the Taj Mahal, the bride told a a questioner happily, "I'm a married woman now," and remarked that she did not like it when people called her "the world's richest girl" and "the tobacco queen."         "Tobacco queen -- what a name!" she said.         Back in the United States, the Cromwells set up housekeeping in ducal style at Duke Farms, with its 30-room stone manor house, its private movie theater (she loved movies) and 42 miles of private roads. For a change of scene, they built an elegant vacation house on the coast of the Hawaiian island of Oahu.         As time passed, relations between the Cromwells soured, and after protracted legal wranglings Mrs. Cromwell was granted a divorce in Reno in 1943 on grounds of cruelty. She resumed the use of her maiden name. Later, she testified that Mr. Cromwell had demanded an "endowment" of $7 million in return for the divorce. Learning to Work And Enjoying It         In 1944, Miss Duke went to Egypt to help the United States war effort by working, for $1 a year, for the United Seaman's Service, which operated canteens for American merchant seamen.         "I couldn't live with myself if I didn't do something real to help in this war," she said at the time. "This may sound funny, but I honestly believe I'm happier now than I've ever been in my life. I feel I'm doing something worthwhile, earning the right to be friends with a lot of swell, interesting people that I've somehow missed before. I've discovered, I guess, that it's fun to work."         Relishing the overseas life, she went on to Europe, where she wrote dispatches in 1945 and 1946 for International News Service, an American news agency that is now defunct, getting around Rome on a bicycle.         Miss Duke was entertaining an American couple in her Rome apartment one day when a suave and handsome Latin American came to call. He was carrying a guitar, which he was to play while she accompanied him on the piano. It was Porfirio Rubirosa, the high-spirited Dominican society figure.         The harmony beween Mr. Rubirosa and Miss Duke proved so compelling that they were married on Sept. 1, 1947, in a civil ceremony at the Dominican Consulate in Paris, where she had gone to work for Harper's Bazaar magazine. He was 39; she was 34. By some accounts the formalities included the bridegroom's signing a legal document that affirmed the bride's control over her fortune.         They spent their honeymoon at Cap d'Antibes, on the French Riviera, where they swam, sunbathed and went motorboating. Not long afterward, he became the Dominican Republic's Ambassador in Buenos Aires.         Despite his charm, the marriage foundered. Miss Duke obtained a Reno divorce from Rubirosa on Oct. 27, 1948, after charging him with extreme mental cruelty.         As time went on it became clear that Miss Duke preferred to remain single. The life she fashioned for herself was largely centered on her estates, and it involved some frivolity and some high seriousness, along with much unobtrusive travel.         It included both new and old interests. She served as a trustee of Duke University, which her family had built up with donations of many millions, and in her later years she became fascinated by the search for alternative sources of energy. Cultivating Gardens And Saving History         At Duke Farms, she laid out a series of interconnected, glassed-in gardens, totaling thousands of square yards, that were opened to the public in 1964 after much labor by her and her workers.         "Sometimes when we're hanging the flowers I spend 16 hours a day," she once told a friend, adding cheerfully, "I work like a stevedore."         She also had a small museum set up on the New Jersey estate to house her collection of Asian art.         Over the years, Miss Duke and the foundation that bore her name made contributions to many other causes, ranging from the advancement of Russian studies at Princeton University to architectural restoration in Newport. She poured millions into the Preservation Society of Newport County, whose mission was to reclaim the city's rundown 18th-century buildings.         The project was welcomed by many Newporters because, among other reasons, it enhanced property values. They were careful to respect Miss Duke's desire for quiet and privacy, and some came to refer to her, almost reverentially, as "the lady."         In 1988, when she was 75, Miss Duke adopted Charlene Gail Heffner, then 35, a former adherent of the Hare Krishna religious group. But by February 1991, Ms. Heffner, known as Chandi, had become persona non grata at Miss Duke's residences, according to an unauthorized biography of Miss Duke, "The Richest Girl in the World" (Putnam, 1992), by Stephanie Mansfield. The author wrote that Miss Duke told a friend later that adopting Ms. Heffner had been "the greatest mistake I ever made."         Later, Ms. Heffner sued Miss Duke for breach of contract. This month, a New Jersey judge ruled against lawyers for Miss Duke, who had sought to have the suit dismissed.         Miss Heffner survives, as does Miss Duke's nephew, Walker Inman Jr. of Georgetown, S.C., and several cousins.       
         Josephine Jablons, a board member of the New York City Opera Company, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 69 and also had a home in Palm Beach, Fla.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Jablons helped found the City Opera Guild in 1959 and for six years served as its president. She led it when the opera celebrated its new home at Lincoln Center with a lavish gala in 1966. She had been on the board of the City Opera since its days at City Center on West 55th Street. She was elected a director of the City Opera Company in July.         A native of Albany and a graduate of Skidmore College, Mrs. Jablons began her career in journalism and public relations. She spent 14 years as a reporter and editor of The New York Herald Tribune in Paris and in New York, covering travel, society, the arts and other subjects.         She also took part in Democratic Party affairs. She was active recently in several organizations helping immigrants.         She is survived by her husband, J. Mitchell Jablons; a daughter, Pamela Jablons of Manhattan; a son, Dr. David Jablons of San Francisco, and a sister, Grace Burke of Colonie, N.Y.       
         Agnes de Mille, who helped change American dance with her ballet "Rodeo" in 1942 and musical comedy with her choreography for "Oklahoma!" a year later, died yesterday in her Greenwich Village apartment. She was 88.         The cause was a stroke, said Dr. Fred Plum, the head of neurology at New York Hospital and a close friend.         In her long career, Miss de Mille proved equally at home on Broadway and on the stage of the Metropolitan Opera House. But she was epecially celebrated for her use of American subject matter and for her ability to combine elements of folk dancing with classical ballet. From Old West to Fall River         In addition to "Oklahoma!," Miss de Mille choreographed such musicals as "Carousel," "Brigadoon" and "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes." Her ballets ranged from "Rodeo," a comic and sentimental evocation of the Old West, to "Fall River Legend," a psychological study of Lizzie Borden.         A witty and vivid writer and speaker, Miss de Mille became an articulate champion of Federal support for the arts.         She remained unquenchable in spirit even after being disabled by a cerebral hemorrhage in 1975. With the aid of rehabilitative therapy and her own enormous willpower, she recovered sufficiently to continue her career, learning to write with her left hand in the process. In 1981, she discussed her illness in "Reprieve," a memoir, written in collaboration with Dr. Plum. In it, she declared, "The patient must have a project, something definite to work to, to work toward." For Miss de Mille, dance was always the project to which she devoted herself. "There was never a sandpapering of the edge of her curiosity." Dr. Plum said yesterday.         Viewing dance as a theatrical and expressive art, Miss de Mille stressed motivated gestures rather than niceties of classical style in her choreography and in her coaching of dancers. For her, bodily movement was a form of communication akin to speech. An eclectic, she drew from ordinary gesture and everyday movement as well as from the technical vocabularies of classical ballet, modern dance and folk and social dance. The dramatic situation always determined the type of movement she employed.         Miss de Mille was proudly American in her tastes and artistic allegiances. Nevertheless, she did not like all aspects of American culture. She often scorned rock music in her lectures. She had little sympathy for the experimental abstract choreography of Merce Cunningham, and in "America Dances," a history published in 1981, she called Twyla Tharp's choreography "tiresomely neurotic."         But in that same volume, she said of such American choreographers as Jerome Robbins, Michael Kidd and herself: "To the classic base we have accordingly added colloquialism. We have come down to earth; we have put our feet on the ground."         Although Miss de Mille was generally praised for her use of American themes, she was sometimes accused of sentimentality, and it was pointed out that the past she celebrated was an idealized vision of history. Commenting on Miss de Mille's choreography, Anna Kisselgoff, the chief dance critic of The New York Times, observed that happiness in one of these Americana ballets tended to be symbolized by "a set of girls in party dresses being lifted by clean-cut young men.         "The unhappy de Mille heroines yearn for this bliss and the fortunate ones enjoy it."         Ms. Kisselgoff also noted, however, that Miss de Mille's works were not invariably optimistic in tone. The choreographer treated the darker side of American history in "The Four Marys," a poignant tale of miscegenation in the days of slavery, and in "Fall River Legend," which was based on the 19th-century murder trial of Lizzie Borden, the shy Massachusetts woman accused of murdering her father and stepmother. Unlike the real Lizzie Borden, who was acquitted, Miss de Mille's heroine, referred to in the program simply as the Accused, is sent to the gallows.  She Felt Destined To Be an Artist         Agnes George de Mille was born into a theatrical family in 1905. Her parents were William C. de Mille, a Broadway playwright and screen writer, and Anna George de Mille, a daughter of Henry George, the social reformer, economist and single-tax advocate. Her father's younger brother was the film director and producer Cecil B. DeMille, who spelled his family name differently.         Miss de Mille's childhood was spent partly in New York City, where her father wrote plays for the Broadway producer David Belasco, and partly in a summer colony called Merriewold in Sullivan County, N.Y. Miss de Mille described life at this vacation site for writers and theater people in her memoir "Where the Wings Grow," in which she recalled how, as a girl, she danced by herself in the woods and felt that she was destined to be an artist.         After her family moved to Hollywood in 1914, Miss de Mille was taken to see performances by Anna Pavlova, the great Russian ballerina, and Ruth St. Denis, one of the founders of American modern dance. She thereupon decided she wanted to become a dancer, and with her sister, Margaret, studied at local ballet schools. But her father was not sympathetic to her desire to make dancing her professional career,and she became an English major at the University of California at Los Angeles, graduating cum laude. But she never gave up her desire to dance.         Her mother, who was more supportive of her artistic aspirations, took Miss de Mille and her sister to New York. While her sister attended college, Miss de Mille tried to find theatrical work. In 1928 she made her choreographic debut in a solo program that included "Stage Fright," a character sketch inspired by a Degas statue depicting a shy young dancer.         Critical reception was favorable, and John Martin, the dance critic of The Times, wrote that like Charlie Chaplin, Miss de Mille "sees tragedy through a lens of comedy." Although she was balletically trained, her fondness for dramatic choreography often led critics to associate her with some of the modern dancers of the period, and her accompanist was Louis Horst, who also composed and played for Martha Graham. In 1931, she appeared with such prominent modern dancers as Miss Graham, Doris Humphrey, Charles Weidman and Helen Tamiris in programs sponsored by the Dance Repertory Theater, a short-lived attempt to bring several independent soloists and companies together.  Staged Porter Show In London in the 30's         After appearing with various minor stock companies and variety shows, Miss de Mille went to Europe in 1932, performing in Paris, Copenhagen and London. While in London, she staged the dances for Cole Porter's "Nymph Errant," which starred Gertrude Lawrence, and gave solo recitals of her own choreography. Arnold Haskell, the leading British critic of the day, called her "the first real idiomatic American dancer" he had seen.         She also became acquainted with Marie Rambert, the director of the experimental Ballet Club (later known as Ballet Rambert) and Rambert's protege Antony Tudor, who developed into the most influential dramatic choreographer of 20th-century ballet. In 1937 Miss de Mille danced in the premiere of Mr. Tudor's "Dark Elegies," an eloquent ballet about grief and mourning.         She occasionally returned to America to choreograph, including the dances for Leslie Howard's 1936 Broadway production of "Hamlet" and the 1937 M-G-M film version of "Romeo and Juliet." She was invited to choreograph for Ballet Theater -- a company now known as American Ballet Theater -- for the group's first season in 1940. The result was "Black Ritual (Obeah)," a choreographic version of Darius Milhaud's "Creation du Monde" for an all-black cast, at that time a rarity in ballet. The next year, she staged "Three Virgins and a Devil," a lusty comedy set in the Middle Ages that was based on a sketch she had created for a London revue in 1934; the piece has often been revived by Ballet Theater.         Also in 1941, Miss de Mille choreographed "Drums Sound in Hackensack" for the Ballets Jooss, a modern-dance company. She thereby became one of the first choreographers to work for both classical and modern groups.  Danced the Lead In Her Own 'Rodeo'         Her first great popular success, however, came in 1942 when she choreographed "Rodeo" for the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo. Because of World War II, that itinerant cosmopolitan troupe had made America its headquarters. American dancers increasingly filled its ranks and it wished to demonstrate that it had become a part of American cultural life. With an original score by Aaron Copland and scenery by Oliver Smith, "Rodeo" told a story about Western ranch life. Miss de Mille originally danced the female lead role herself. But other dancers soon took over the part and the ballet has been revived by many companies, including American Ballet Theater and the Joffrey Ballet.         "Rodeo" told a cheerful story in vigorous terms. But it was an important work for more than its good humor. As produced by the Ballet Russe, "Rodeo" constituted an affirmation that American subject matter could be treated in balletic terms and that it could be successfully interpreted by dancers of many nationalities. "Rodeo," like such other Americana ballets of the period as "Billy the Kid" and "Filling Station," therefore countered the arguments of those fanatical modern dancers who maintained that ballet was an art of the courts of Europe that could never flourish in democratic America.         "Rodeo" led to Miss de Mille's next triumph. Among those excited by the work were Theresa Helburn and Lawrence Langner of the Theater Guild, the composer Richard Rodgers and the lyricist Oscar Hammerstein 2d. These theatrical figures were planning a new musical based on Lynn Riggs's play "Green Grow the Lilacs," and they asked Miss de Mille to choreograph it. The result was one of the greatest hits in the history of American musical comedy: "Oklahoma!" opened on Broadway in 1943 and ran for more than five years.         Ballet choreographers had previously worked on Broadway. Albertina Rasch did so in the 1920's; George Balanchine choreographed successful musicals in the 30's. What made Miss de Mille's contributions to "Oklahoma!" seem distinctive to audiences of the 40's was the way that dancing, far from being a mere diversion or spectacle, was integrated into the show's dramatic action. This was especially true of the principal choreographic sequence, "Laurey Makes Up Her Mind," in which the work's heroine was shown torn between two suitors.  Created 'People And Not Automata'         Writing of "Oklahoma!," Mr. Martin commented in The Times: "Miss de Mille has turned her back entirely on the established procedure of making 'routines.' She has selected some delightful young people to dance for her, and she has built her dances directly and most unorthodoxly upon them. As a result, they emerge as people and not as automata -- warm and believable people made larger than life and more endearing by the formalized movement through which they project themselves."         Miss de Mille followed "Oklahoma!" with "One Touch of Venus" in 1943 and "Bloomer Girl" in 1944. In the latter, according to Mr. Martin, her choreography again "translated the inner workings of the heroine's mind at a moment of crisis."         Having become an established figure in the musical theater, she proceeded to choreograph such shows as "Carousel" (1945); "Allegro" (1947), which she directed as well as choreographed; "Brigadoon" (1947); "Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" (1949); "Paint Your Wagon" (1951); "The Girl in Pink Tights" (1954); "Goldilocks" (1958); "Juno" (1959); "Kwamina" (1961), and "110 in the Shade" (1963). In 1950 she directed "Out of This World," but the choreography was by the modern dancer Hanya Holm.         Miss de Mille continued to create works for American Ballet Theater, including "Tally-Ho" (1944), "Fall River Legend" (1948), "The Harvest According" (1952), "Rib of Eve" (1956), "Sebastian" (1957), "The Wind in the Mountains" and "The Four Marys" (both 1965), "A Rose for Miss Emily" (1971) and "Texas Fourth" (1976). In 1973 she established the Heritage Dance Theater, a folk-oriented company that toured widely until 1975.         Miss de Mille often recycled theatrical material. Just as a revue sketch turned into "Three Virgins and a Devil," so bits of solos she had created in the 30's on Western themes were incorporated into "Rodeo." A Civil War ballet in "Bloomer Girl" served as the basis for "The Harvest According," a serious work that was also inspired by a Walt Whitman poem. "The Bitter Weird," choreographed for the Royal Winnipeg Ballet in 1961, used ballet music from "Brigadoon."  Her Final Work Dealt With Death         In 1988 Miss de Mille used some of Marc Blitzstein's music from "Juno" for American Ballet Theater's production of "The Informer," which dealt with the struggles between the English and the Irish from 1917 to 1921. One of her most striking creations of recent years, "The Informer" was unusual because, although the Irish rebels were visible on stage, their English opponents were not. The presence of the English was indicated only through the postures and gestures of the other dancers. Miss de Mille's final ballet was "The Other," a symbolic depiction of the encounter between a young woman and death that American Ballet Theater presented in 1992.         Miss de Mille's books included several volumes of memoirs: "Dance to the Piper," "And Promenade Home," "Speak to Me, Dance With Me" and "Where the Wings Grow," in addition to "Reprieve." Her other books were "To a Young Dancer," "The Book of the Dance," "Lizzie Borden: A Dance of Death," "Russian Journals," "Dance in America" and "America Dances." Her most recent book, "Martha: The Life and Work of Martha Graham," published in 1991, was a lively and highly opinionated commentary on the great modern dancer.         Miss de Mille was much in demand as a speaker, both on cultural programs on television and on the lecture circuit. She gave lecture-demonstrations based on dance history and often appeared before government bodies to argue for increased State and Federal support for the arts.         Speaking at the 50th-anniversary gala of American Ballet Theater, in January 1990 at the Metropolitan Opera House, Miss de Mille tried to distill the essence of American dance in these words: "Ours is an up beat, a hurried, hasty beat. It keeps pressing us to go farther, to include everything so that we can savor everything, so that we can know everything, so that we will miss nothing. Partly it's greed, but mainly it's curiosity. We just want to experience it. And we do."         Miss de Mille received more than 15 honorary degrees and was elected to the Theater Hall of Fame in 1973. She received the Handel Medallion, New York's highest award for achievement in the arts, in 1976; the Kennedy Center Career Achievement Award in 1980, and the National Medal of the Arts in 1986. She was an original member of the National Council on the Arts and the first chairman of its Dance Panel in 1965. That year, she also became the first president of the Society of Stage Directors and Choreographers. Among her other awards were the Donaldson Award, the Antoinette Perry (Tony) Award, the Elizabeth Blackwell Award, the Dance Magazine Award, the Capezio Dance Award and the De la Torre Bueno Award for writings on dance.         Miss de Mille was married to Walter Prude, a concert-artists' manager, from 1943 until his death in 1988. She is survived by a son, Jonathan, and two grandsons, David Robert and Michael James, all of Atlanta, and a niece, Judith de Mille Donelan of Easton, Md.       
         Mary Shea Giordano, for many years a leader of Roman Catholic philanthropic groups in New York, died on Tuesday at St. Patrick's Home for the Aged in the Bronx. She was 90.         Mrs. Giordano served as president of the Ladies of Charity of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York for 25 years starting in 1952. She also served on groups advising Catholic Charities, Fordham University, St. John's University, Elizabeth Seton College and St. Joseph's Seminary in Yonkers.         She was a graduate of the College of New Rochelle, a past president of its alumnae association, and a former trustee.         She was the widow of Amedeo Giordano, a New York real-estate developer who died in 1952.       
         Jane G. Judge, who spent five decades as a social worker, educator and child advocate, died on Wednesday at her home in Bronxville, N.Y. She was 91.         She suffered a brief illness, her family said.         For many years Mrs. Judge was associated with Sarah Lawrence College, where she was professor emeritus of childhood development, and the Community Service Society of New York. A vivacious woman who cared passionately about her causes, she came to the Community Service Society in 1932 and worked there into the 1950's, finally as a consultant on its child-care program.         From the 1930's until 1947, she ran the society's district office in Harlem. Appalled that the office was staffed entirely by white social workers trying to serve a mostly black community, she convinced the board of the need to bring in trained black workers.         She first came to Sarah Lawrence in 1937, teaching part time at the invitation of Constance Warren, then college president. She retired as a professor in 1971 but remained a consultant and director of its early-childhood center for five more years. Over the years, she also taught at Columbia and New York Universities.         Born Jane Griswold in Madison, Wis., she was a 1924 graduate of Smith College and held a master's degree from the New York School of Social Work, now part of Columbia University.         She collaborated with Dr. Benjamin Spock to develop treatment centers for children in Westchester, which did not exist in the 1940's, and to organize the Mental Health Association of Westchester. When the Federal Government set up the Headstart program for pre-schoolers, she served as a consultant.         Her husband, John S. Judge, died in 1973.

         Phyllis Van Buren Richard Gerrity, a philanthropist and sportswoman who was prominent in nonprofit institutions involving children and young people in the Albany area, died on Saturday at her home in Loudonville, outside Albany. She was 74.         She had had a long illness, her family said.         Mrs. Gerrity, a great-great-great niece of President Martin Van Buren, was a former president of St. Margaret's Center for Children, in Albany. She also served on the boards of Wildwood School and Trinity Institute, a settlement house, both in Albany, and on a regional Planned Parenthood board.         She played in the United States Open mixed doubles tennis championship in 1940.         She was born in Manhattan and attended Nightingale-Bamford School there and the Ethel Walker School in Simsbury, Conn.         She is survived by her husband, Joseph W.

         Dr. Marie H. Briehl, one of the country's earliest child psychoanalysts, died on Saturday at her home in Mamaroneck, N.Y. She was 96.         The cause was heart failure, her family said.         Dr. Briehl was director emeritus of the child analysis section at the Southern California Psychoanalytic Institute in Los Angeles.         Born in Czarist Russia, she came to this country as a toddler. She graduated from Hunter College and taught at Hunter College High School. Along with her husband, Dr. Walter Briehl, she received her psychoanalytic education in Vienna in the 1920's. She trained with Anna Freud, daughter of Sigmund Freud and herself a founder of child analysis.         Returning to New York in 1930, Dr. Briehl resumed her teaching career and also started psychological and psychoanalytic treatment of children privately and at Mount Sinai Hospital. She became a full-time analyst in 1940.         Six years later, she and her husband moved to Los Angeles, where she established the training program for child analysis in the Southern California Psychoanalytic Society and Institute and worked as training and supervising analyst.         She became the first director of the institute's section on child analysis, serving for almost 20 years. She reached emeritus status in 1976 but continued to practice and teach in Los Angeles until moving back to New York in 1991.         Working in education, she helped found the Westland School in Los Angeles, a progressive school where she served as a consultant. She and her husband were active in human-rights causes, helping European analysts escape from Europe in the 1930's and establish themselves in the United States.         Her husband, a pioneer of group therapy methods, died in 1982. She is survived by a son, Dr. Robin Briehl of Lewisboro, N.Y.; a brother, Peter Hawley of Yonkers; two sisters, Elizabeth Delza Munson and Sophia Delza Glassgold, both of Manhattan, and one granddaughter.       
         Rita Klimova, a former dissident who served as Czechoslovakia's first Ambassador to the United States after the ouster of the Communist Government, died yesterday in a hospital in Prague. She was 62.         Her death was reported by The Associated Press, which quoted C.T.K., the official news agency of the Czech Republic. She had recently undergone treatment for leukemia.         Mrs. Klimova was diagnosed as having the disease shortly after she was named Ambassador to Washington in February 1990. She stepped down from the post in August 1992, less than four months before her country split into two nations, the Czech Republic and Slovakia.         After her retirement from the Czech diplomatic service last year, she lectured on Czech affairs at several universities, including the New School in Manhattan. Schooling in New York         Mrs. Klimova was born in Europe but spent part of her youth in Manhattan, where her family fled in 1939 after the German invasion of Czechoslovakia. Her father, Batya Bat, was a journalist and writer who used the pen name Stanislav Budin.         She attended grade school and junior high school in New York. In 1946, her family returned to Czechoslovakia, where she attended high school and college.         Mrs. Klimova became a member of the Communist Party in 1948. She worked as a translator and taught political economics at Charles University in Prague.         She was dismissed from her university post after Soviet-led troops of the Warsaw Pact invaded Czechoslovakia in 1968 to crush the liberal reforms of Alexander Dubcek.         She devoted her efforts to defending human rights and the political opposition, and she was expelled from the party in 1970. In 1989 Mrs. Klimova became the spokeswoman for the peaceful revolution that toppled the Communist Government and elevated her fellow dissident, the playwright Vaclav Havel, to the presidency. Voice of the Revolution         When the Communist regime began to disintegrate in November of 1989, she nearly missed the big moment.         She had been in Hungary meeting with two Czechoslovak exiles, and she drove home on the night of Nov. 19. There she found a message from Mr. Havel saying he wanted to meet with her the next morning.         Arriving at his apartment, she found him facing television cameras and photographers. Mr. Havel had called a news conference to mobilize the anti-Communist opposition, and he wanted to be sure Mrs. Klimova would be there to convey his message in American English.         She sat down next to him and began interpreting. For the next several weeks, as the old order crumbled, hers was the English-language voice of the "Velvet Revolution," an expression that she coined.         She is survived by a son, Vladimir Mlynar, and a daughter, Michaela Barlova, both of Prague.       
         Alice Tully, a philanthropist who was an important figure in New York City's musical life for almost half a century, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.         Her lawyer, James McGarry, said the cause was the flu. She had not been seen in public since suffering a stroke in 1991.         Miss Tully, for whom Lincoln Center's chamber-music hall is named, was as respected for her knowledge of music and its practitioners as for her generosity.         As a singer who had a modest operatic and recital career in the 1930's, she was keenly aware of the problems performers face, and throughout her life was a friend and supporter of singers, pianists and composers. After she inherited her family's wealth -- her maternal grandfather was Amory Houghton, the founder of Corning Glass Works -- she donated many millions of dollars to the arts. A Birthday Portrait         For many years Miss Tully made her contributions anonymously, and when she agreed to underwrite a chamber-music hall in the Juilliard Building at Lincoln Center, she stipulated that her name not be associated with it. Eventually, John D. Rockefeller 3d, Lincoln Center's first chairman, persuaded her to allow the hall to be named in her honor. In 1987, to celebrate her 85th birthday, Lincoln Center commissioned Thomas Buechner to paint a full-length portrait of her, which hangs in the hall's main foyer. Miss Tully always refused to tell how much of the hall's cost she contributed, but she did not dispute reports that said she paid most of the $4.5 million.         She did say that one reason she was hesitant to accept the hall's dedication at first was that Philharmonic Hall and the New York State Theater had been acoustical disasters. "I did not want my name associated with a hall that would have bad acoustics," she told an interviewer in 1987. She changed her mind when Lincoln Center engaged Heinrich Keilholz, who had revamped Severance Hall in Cleveland in 1958, as acoustician.  More Space, Fewer Seats         She took an active hand in the hall's design, selecting the colors of the walls, seat covering and foyer carpeting. She paid particular attention to adequate leg room.         "I had spent so many, many hours cramped in narrow spaces, both here and in Europe, and I felt that this was something we should have," she said in the 1987 interview. "The architects disagreed, because what I wanted would have meant having three fewer rows. So I went to William Schuman, who was president of Lincoln Center at the time, and I said: 'You're a tall man. Wouldn't you like to sit comfortably? Do let us have one comfortable hall in New York City.' "         Mr. Schuman agreed, Miss Tully said. "So I drew a breath of relief. But I had to keep my eye on it just the same."         Later, after much personal research in Europe, she was deeply involved in selecting the Theodore Kuhn Company to build the hall's organ, which experts said cost well over $250,000.         When the hall was in the planning stages, Miss Tully encouraged the creation of its resident ensemble, the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, and was the chairwoman of its board for many years. She also served on the boards of the New York Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera and the Juilliard School of Music. Myriad Beneficiaries         In addition to her involvement with Lincoln Center, Miss Tully was an active supporter of dance, art and humanitarian organizations. She gave generously to the Martha Graham Dance Company and Eliot Feld's ballet troupe, and she was a board member of numerous other arts and educational institutions. She contributed to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the Frick Collection and the Morgan Library, among others.         Michael J. Spencer, a pianist who founded Hospital Audiences, which provides access to the arts for the disabled, said yesterday that when he began playing concerts in state mental hospitals in the 1960's he sought funds everywhere and only one organization responded. "It was something called the Maya Corporation, and it was only in the early 70's that I found out it was Alice Tully providing the funds." Miss Tully had founded the corporation to disperse cash gifts anonymously. Mr. Spencer added that he received a Maya donation only last week.         Miss Tully never wanted the extent of her largesse known. Irwin Scherzer, the manager of the Chamber Music Society in its early days and a close friend of Miss Tully, said: "She wouldn't know herself how much money she had donated. She did what she thought was best, where she thought it would do the most good."         Alice Bigelow Tully was born on Sept. 11, 1902, in Corning, N.Y. Her father, William J. Tully, was a lawyer and a two-term New York State senator. The actress Katharine Hepburn is her second cousin. When Mr. Tully became general counsel to the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company in 1908, the family moved to New York City, where Miss Tully attended Mrs. J. D. Randall MacIvor's School. Later she continued her studies at the Westover School in Middlebury, Conn.  A Recital Inspired Her         Miss Tully often said that she decided to devote herself to music when she was 14 or 15 years old, after hearing a recital by the pianist Josef Hofmann. But although piano studies were part of her schooling, her first musical love was singing. In 1922, after studying voice in New York for three years, she went to Paris for seven years of study with Jean Perier, the baritone who created the role of Pelleas in Debussy's opera "Pelleas et Melisande," and with Miguel Fontecha and Therese Leschetizky.         Beginning as a mezzo-soprano and then moving to the dramatic soprano repertory, Miss Tully made her professional debut in 1927, when she sang works by Gluck, Franck, Chausson and Faure with the Pasdeloup Orchestra in Paris. Six years later she made her operatic debut at the Hippodrome in New York, singing Santuzza -- her best role, by her own estimation -- in a Salmaggi Opera production of Mascagni's "Cavalleria Rusticana."         She also sang the title role in a production of Bizet's "Carmen" at the Manhattan Opera House in 1935, and through the late 1930's she performed frequently as a recitalist in Europe and the United States. Reviewing a 1937 Town Hall recital in The New York Times, Olin Downes wrote that Miss Tully's program was of "rare interest and artistic distinction" and praised her "musicianly zeal and catholicity of taste."         Miss Tully, looking back on her career in a 1982 interview with Harold C. Schonberg of The Times, said: "It may not have been the biggest career, but it was a good one. I was always concerned with the best in music, and I think I had something individual to offer."  Avid Amateur Pilot         With the outbreak of World War II, Miss Tully settled permanently in New York and continued her vocal studies. But she suspended her career to devote herself to the war effort. An avid amateur pilot, she joined the Civil Air Patrol and flew on submarine scouting missions. But she decided to "be of more use" and became a Red Cross nurse's aid at the French Hospital in Manhattan.         In 1950, Miss Tully stopped singing professionally because, she later said, she felt that her voice was losing its flexibility. Upon the death of her mother, Clara Houghton Tully, in 1958, Miss Tully inherited a substantial estate, and began her career as a philanthropist. It was at about that time that her cousin, Arthur Houghton Jr., one of the founders of Lincoln Center, approached her with the idea of contributing toward the concert hall that now bears her name.         The hall opened on Miss Tully's 67th birthday, Sept. 11, 1969, with a program by the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center. It was judged a superb setting for chamber music, both acoustically and visually, and the most successful of Lincoln Center's concert halls.         Miss Tully, who never married, was a tall, slender, regal woman with a friendly smile, a wry sense of humor, and a comprehensive knowledge of musical literature and the world of performers. After chamber music and art songs, her love was opera, particularly Wagner, and well into her 80's she regularly traveled to Europe to see new productions, keep track of singers and directors, and serve on competition juries. She was especially fond of the Spoleto Festival in Italy; its founder, Gian Carlo Menotti, wrote "Cantilene e Scherzo" and "Nocturne" for her. Others who dedicated works to her include Mr. Schuman, who wrote "A Round for Alice," and Riccardo Malipiero, who composed "Serenata per Alice Tully." Recipient of Many Honors         In 1970, Miss Tully was awarded a Handel Medallion, New York City's highest cultural award. She received the Gallatin Medal from New York University in 1976 for "contributions of lasting significance to society," was a recipient of the first National Medal of Arts in 1985, and received the American Red Cross Humanitarian Award in 1988. A devoted Francophile for most of her life, she received many honors from the French Government, and was made an officer in the French Legion of Honor.         Miss Tully's only sibling, a younger sister, Marion Tully Dimick of Washington, died in 1981.
