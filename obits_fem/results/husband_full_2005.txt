         Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman to serve in Congress and the first woman to seek the Democratic presidential nomination, died on Saturday night at her home in Ormond Beach, Fla. She was 80. She had suffered several strokes recently, according to a former staff member, William Howard.         Mrs. Chisholm was an outspoken, steely educator-turned-politician who shattered racial and gender barriers as she became a national symbol of liberal politics in the 1960's and 1970's. Over the years, she also had a way of making statements that angered the establishment, as in 1974, when she asserted that ''there is an undercurrent of resistance'' to integration ''among many blacks in areas of concentrated poverty and discrimination'' -- including in her own district in Brooklyn.         ''Just wait, there may be some fireworks,'' she declared after winning her seat in Congress in 1968 with an upset victory in Brooklyn's 12th Congressional District, which had been created by court-ordered reapportionment.         Her slogan was ''unbought and unbossed'' -- in the primary, she had defeated two other candidates, William C. Thompson, whom she maintained was the candidate of the Brooklyn Democratic organization, and Dolly Robinson. ''The party leaders do not like me,'' Mrs. Chisholm said at the time.         But about 80 percent of the registered voters in the district -- which included her own neighborhood, Bedford-Stuyvesant -- were Democrats. That edge helped her in her race against James Farmer, a leader of the Freedom Rides in the south in the early 1960's, who ran as an independent on the Republican and Liberal lines, and Ralph Carrano, who ran as the Conservative candidate.         ''I am an historical person at this point, and I'm very much aware of it,'' she told The Washington Post a few months after she was sworn in.         Soon she was challenging the seniority system in the House, which had relegated her to its Agriculture Committee, an assignment she criticized as irrelevant to an urban district like hers.         ''Apparently all they know here in Washington about Brooklyn is that a tree grew there,'' she said in a statement at the time. ''Only nine black people have been elected to Congress, and those nine should be used as effectively as possible.''         She said that the House speaker, John W. McCormack, had told her to ''be a good soldier'' and accept the agriculture assignment. Instead, she fired a parliamentary salvo at the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Wilbur D. Mills, who handed out the committee assignments. Before long, she was reassigned, first to the Veterans Affairs Committee, and eventually to the Education and Labor Committees.         Winning a better committee assignment did not make her any less acerbic on the workings of Washington. ''Our representative democracy is not working,'' she wrote in a 1970 book that borrowed her campaign slogan as its title, ''because the Congress that is supposed to represent the voters does not respond to their needs. I believe the chief reason for this is that it is ruled by a small group of old men.''         In 1972, when she entered the presidential primaries, she did not expect to capture the Democratic nomination, which ultimately went to George S. McGovern. ''Some see my candidacy as an alternate and others as symbolic or a move to make other candidates start addressing themselves to real issues,'' she said at the time. She did not win a single primary, but in 2002, she said her campaign had been a necessary ''catalyst for change.''         She was also aware of her status as a woman in politics. ''I've always met more discrimination being a woman than being black,'' she told The Associated Press in December 1982, shortly before she left Washington to teach at Mount Holyoke College in Massachusetts. ''When I ran for the Congress, when I ran for president, I met more discrimination as a woman than for being black. Men are men.''         Shirley Anita St. Hill Chisholm was born in Bedford-Stuyvesant on Nov. 30, 1924. Her father worked in a factory that made burlap bags, and her mother was a seamstress and domestic worker. They sent their daughter and her three sisters to Barbados, where the children lived with a grandmother until 1934. Mrs. Chisholm later described the relatives she encountered there as ''a strongly disciplined family unit.''         But she had her own strength, too: ''Mother always said that even when I was 3, I used to get the 6- and 7-year-old kids on the block and punch them and say, 'Listen to me.'''         Her professors listened to her at Brooklyn College, where she won prizes in debating. Some of them told her she should think about politics as a career.         First, though, she taught in a nursery school and earned a master's degree in elementary education at Columbia University. Working as the director of the Friends Day Nursery in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn and the Hamilton-Madison Child Care Center in Lower Manhattan, she became widely known as an authority on early education and child welfare. She argued that early schooling was essential, saying she knew there were experts who maintained that children's eyes were not developed enough for reading. ''I say baloney, because I learned to read when I was 3 1/2,'' she countered, ''and I learned to write when I was 4.''         From 1959 to 1964, she was an educational consultant in the day care division of the city's bureau of child welfare. But she laid a foundation for her eventual political career, working as a clubhouse volunteer and with organizations like the Bedford-Stuyvesant Political League and the League of Women Voters.         So, when she decided to run for the New York State Assembly in 1964, she said the decision was straightforward: ''The people wanted me.''         She moved on to the House four years later, in the year when President Lyndon B. Johnson decided not to run for re-election. A year later, she confirmed her reputation for independence when she endorsed John V. Lindsay, who was running for re-election as mayor of New York         as the Liberal Party candidate.By 1982, the political climate had changed, and Mrs. Chisholm left Washington after seven terms in the House, saying that ''moderate and liberal'' lawmakers were ''running for cover from the new right.'' But she also had personal reasons for deciding not to seek re-election that year: Her second husband, Arthur Hardwick, a Buffalo liquor store owner who had been in the New York State Assembly when Mrs. Chisholm was, had been injured in a car accident. (Her first marriage, to Conrad O. Chisholm, ended in divorce in 1977. Mr. Hardwick died in 1986.)         ''I had been so consumed by my life in politics,'' she said in 1982. ''I had no time for privacy, no time for my husband, no time to play my beautiful grand piano. After he recovered, I decided to make some changes in my life. I truly believe God had a message for me.''         She also sounded frustrated, saying she had been misunderstood for much of her career. She mentioned her hospital visit to George C. Wallace, the Alabama governor who built his political career on segregation, after he had been wounded in an assassination attempt in 1972.         ''Black people in my community crucified me,'' she recalled. ''But why shouldn't I go to visit him? Every other presidential candidate was going to see him. He said to me, 'What are your people going to say?' I said: 'I know what they're going to say. But I wouldn't want what happened to you to happen to anyone.' He cried and cried and cried.''         She maintained that her visit had paid off. ''He always spoke well of Shirley Chisholm in the South,'' she said, adding that she had contacted him in 1974, when she was looking for votes for a bill to extend federal minimum-wage provisions to domestic workers. ''Many of the Southerners did not want to make the vote. They came around.''         Mrs. Chisholm moved to Florida in 1991 and said in 2002, ''I live a very quiet life.'' She said she spent her time reading biographies -- political biographies.         ''I have faded out of the scene,'' she said.         When she left Washington, she said she did not want to go down in history as ''the nation's first black congresswoman'' or, as she put it, ''the first black woman congressman.''         ''I'd like them to say that Shirley Chisholm had guts,'' she said. ''That's how I'd like to be remembered.''       
         Lucy Freeman, a reporter and an author whose early coverage of psychiatry and mental health for The New York Times led to wider reporting on the subject, died on Wednesday at the Hebrew Home for the Aged at Riverdale, in the Bronx. She was 88.         The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, said her nephew David L. Schroedel.         Ms. Freeman, one of the few women on the Times's reporting staff when she was hired in 1940, initially wrote light society features, but moved to breaking news with an award-winning story on the explosion of two ships hauling munitions in Galveston Bay, Tex., in 1947.         By the late 1940's, some time after she began undergoing her own psychoanalysis, she persuaded editors to allow coverage of the growth of psychiatry and the preservation of Sigmund Freud's private papers.         ''It was even more unusual because it was in an era in which psychology was not popular,'' said Nan Robertson, the author of ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men and The New York Times.'' ''It used to be that people poked fun at getting shrunk.''         Over the course of four years, she reported on welfare, the stigma of mental illness and advancements in treatments for schizophrenic patients. She also studied mental health and welfare programs in the city hospital system.         Her nonfiction books, ranging from detailed studies of Freud to those exploring sources of anger and anxiety, helped familiarize a popular audience with what had long been a hush-hush practice.         Ms. Freeman's first book, ''Fight Against Fears,'' recounted her own experience as a psychoanalysis patient who struggled to overcome her shy, whispery voice and social fears. Published in 1951, the book was in print for 47 years.         Ms. Freeman also wrote 77 other books, including mystery novels and memoirs.         The first of four children born to a prominent New York family, Ms. Freeman was a member of the first graduating class at Bennington College in Vermont.         She was hired by The New York Times in 1940 and would later describe the newsroom of the day as ''a sea of male reporters.''         ''I hardly dared savor the glory. All those men,'' she wrote in a memoir, ''The Beloved Prison,'' (St. Martin's Press, 1989). ''I also dared the fleeting thought that among all these masculine forms perhaps I would find a husband.''         She eventually married William M. Freeman, an editor who had fixed an error in a story she filed from Texas. The marriage lasted two years.         Fond of low-cut dresses and high-heeled shoes, Ms. Freeman relished the attention she received from her male colleagues on the city desk, Ms. Robertson said. Mary Yost, Ms. Freeman's agent for more than 15 years, said that she digested academic papers like a scholar, but always preferred to write for a larger audience.         She could at times ''appear to be an ingénue, an innocent,'' Ms. Yost said, but she also played a mean game of poker, loved throwing large parties at her apartment with a view of Central Park, and mixed as easily with jockeys as she did with actors and intellectuals.         ''She enjoyed a popular audience for her work, and she wanted it in her social life, too,'' Ms. Yost said.         Ms. Freeman is survived by her brother, Edward Greenbaum of Clearwater, Fla; her sister, Sue Polera of Las Vegas; her sister and brother-in-law, Sally and Warren Rosenberg of Scarborough, N.Y.; and numerous nieces and nephews.       
         Marjorie Williams, a Washington Post columnist and contributing editor for Vanity Fair who was known for sharp observations on the political elite, died yesterday at her home in Washington. She was 47.         The cause was liver cancer, said her husband, Timothy Noah.         Ms. Williams became a columnist in 2000, after more than a decade of writing lengthy profiles on Washington power brokers, including Vice President Al Gore and the Democratic diplomat Clark Clifford.         Her column was syndicated in July 2001, the same week her fourth-stage cancer was diagnosed, Mr. Noah said.         Ms. Williams attended Harvard for two years, but dropped out and went to work in publishing, where she worked for several years before getting a job as an editor at The Post. Later, she asked to move to a writing position in The Post's Style section and frequently wrote for Vanity Fair.         ''What she used to say at the time was, 'I want to be one of the children as opposed to one of the grown-ups,'' said Mr. Noah, a writer for Slate who frequently showed his wife his own stories. ''But what she was most proud of was being a mom.''         In a column published last November, Ms. Williams wrote of her helping her daughter dress in an elaborate Halloween costume.         ''So how could I explain the euphoria of the 45 minutes Alice and I spent in her bedroom, colluding over her hair, giggling at her faux leather, deeply fringed bell-bottoms? The pleasure of watching her strap on those awful silver platform shoes, like something I wore in 1973?'' she wrote. ''I'd just seen Alice leave for her prom, or her first real date. I'd cheated time, flipping the calendar five or six years into the future. The character I'd played was the 52-year-old mother I will probably never be.''         In addition to her husband and her daughter, Ms. Williams is survived by her son, Will, and her sisters, Wistar Rawls of Monkton, Vt., Anne Williams of Ringoes, N.J., and Rosina Williams of Jersey City.       
         Nell Rankin, an American mezzo-soprano who sang at the Metropolitan Opera for 25 years and was highly regarded for her warm-toned portrayals of Amneris in Verdi's ''Aida'' and in the title role in Bizet's ''Carmen,'' died last Thursday at Cabrini Medical Center in New York. She was 81, and lived in New York.         Her husband, Dr. Hugh Clark Davidson, said the cause was polycythemia vera, a bone marrow disease.         During her years at the Met, Ms. Rankin sang many of the major dramatic mezzo-soprano roles. Among them were Amneris, with which she made her debut on Nov. 22, 1951, and several other Verdi roles -- Eboli in ''Don Carlo,'' Azucena in ''Il Trovatore'' and Ulrica in ''Un Ballo en Maschera,'' as well as Carmen, Ortrud in Wagner's ''Lohengrin,'' Santuzza in Mascagni's ''Cavalleria Rusticana'' and Herodias in Strauss's ''Salome.'' She ended her Met career in 1976, singing Laura in Ponchielli's ''Gioconda.''         Nell Rankin was born in Birmingham, Ala., on Jan. 3, 1924, and she studied with Jeanne Lorraine at the Birmingham Conservatory. She was a determined performer, and when the soprano Helen Traubel visited Birmingham to sing a recital in 1943 Ms. Rankin went backstage and persuaded Ms. Traubel's accompanist, Coenraad Bos, to hear her sing. On Bos's advice, she moved to New York to continue her studies with Karin Branzell. She made her debut at Town Hall, in a joint recital with her sister, Ruth Rankin, a soprano, in March 1947. Her operatic debut in New York was in a production of ''Aida'' at the Salmaggi Opera Company, in Brooklyn, in which she sang Amneris and her sister sang the title role.         In 1948, Ms. Rankin joined the Zurich Opera Company, where she made her debut as Ortrud in ''Lohengrin'' in 1949, and went on to sing 126 performances in her first year. Her breakthrough, though, came in 1950, when she became the first American singer to win the first prize at the International Music Competition in Geneva.         That victory led to her debuts at La Scala and at the Vienna State Opera, both as Amneris, in 1951, and to her Met debut in the same role later that year. Debuts at Covent Garden and the San Francisco Opera followed in 1953. On both occasions, she sang the title role in ''Carmen.''         In addition to her performances at the Met, Ms. Rankin continued to sing at major houses around the world, including La Scala, where she sang Cassandra, in Berlioz's ''Troyens,'' in 1960, and the Teatro San Carlo, in Naples, where she sang Adalgisa in Bellini's ''Norma,'' in 1963. She also sang with companies in Chicago, Fort Worth, Buenos Aires, Havana, Mexico City and Athens.         Ms. Rankin was the star of a CBS television production of ''Carmen'' in 1954, and she made several recordings, including a 1961 account of Puccini's ''Madama Butterfly'' in which she sang Suzuki and Renata Tebaldi sang the title role. The performance was recently reissued by Naxos Records.         After she retired from the Met, Ms. Rankin devoted herself to teaching, first at the Academy of Vocal Arts in Philadelphia, and then privately in New York until she retired in 1991.         She is survived by her husband.       
         Anne Cox, a New York socialite who designed high fashion for high society in the 1950's and became the mother-in-law of a president's daughter, died on Tuesday in Westhampton Beach, N.Y. She was 86 and a resident of Palm Beach, Fla.         The cause was Lewy body disease, a form of dementia similar to Alzheimer's, her son Howard said.         Mrs. Cox offered her own designs in a boutique on 57th Street in Manhattan. She was also an occasional fashion and society columnist for The Herald Tribune and a fashion adviser for Bergdorf Goodman. Later she worked as a real estate developer in the Hamptons.         Mrs. Cox was descended on her mother's side from the socially prominent Livingston family. She was a patron of charities, including the Association for the Relief of Respectable, Aged, Indigent Females, of which she was president, and she was long the chairwoman or a co-chairwoman of the annual International Debutante Ball.         Anne Delafield Finch Cox was born in Westhampton Beach on March 13, 1918, and graduated from the Chapin School, where she was later a trustee and president of the alumnae association.         Her husband, Howard Ellis Cox, a New York lawyer, died in 1989. In addition to her son Howard Ellis Jr. of Boston, she is survived by a daughter, Mazie Livingston Delafield Cox of Northampton, Mass.; another son, Edward, who is married to Tricia Nixon, of Manhattan; a brother, Edward Ridley Finch Jr. of Manhattan; and three grandchildren.       
         Shirley Chisholm, the first black woman to serve in Congress and the first woman to seek the Democratic presidential nomination, died on Saturday night at her home in Ormond Beach, Fla. She was 80.         She died after several recent strokes, according to a former staff member, William Howard.         Mrs. Chisholm was an outspoken, steely educator-turned-politician who shattered racial and gender barriers as she became a national symbol of liberal politics in the 1960's and 1970's.

''Just wait, there may be some fireworks,'' she declared after winning her seat in Congress in 1968 with an upset victory in Brooklyn's 12th Congressional District, which had been created by court-ordered reapportionment.

But about 80 percent of the registered voters in the district, which included her own neighborhood, Bedford-Stuyvesant, were Democrats.

''Men are men.''         Shirley Anita St. Hill Chisholm was born in Bedford-Stuyvesant on Nov. 30, 1924. Her father worked in a factory that made burlap bags, and her mother was a seamstress and domestic worker. They sent their daughter and her three sisters to Barbados, where the children lived with a grandmother until 1934.

         Sarah Jewler, the managing editor of New York magazine, died on Wednesday in Manhattan. She was 56.         The cause was a rare blood disorder she had suffered with for many years, said her husband, Jay Kennedy.         Ms. Jewler was a steady presence at the magazine even as it switched editors, owners and editorial approaches. She was hired as managing editor in 1994 by its editor at the time, Kurt Andersen, and continued to serve in that role under Caroline Miller and, more recently, Adam Moss.         ''She was in many ways the emotional center of the magazine,'' said Ms. Miller, who left the magazine in February 2004. As managing editor, Ms. Jewler coordinated the practical parts of putting together a weekly, including negotiating writers' payments and contracts, devising annual budgets and ensuring the steady flow of articles.         Sarah Jewler was born on May 18, 1948, in Washington and graduated from George Washington University. Before joining New York magazine, she worked at Manhattan Inc., The Village Voice and Rolling Stone with many of the more prominent editors of the last few decades, including Peter W. Kaplan and Clay Felker.         ''When I met her, she exuded former hipster -- she had lived in communes and been a rock drummer,'' said Mr. Kaplan, who is now the editor of The New York Observer. ''She could make people fall into line by lifting an eyebrow,'' he added. She continued to work until last week.         In addition to Mr. Kennedy, who is editor in chief of the King Features Syndicate, Ms. Jewler is survived by a brother, Leonard Jewler of Washington, and her mother, Esther Jewler of Silver Spring, Md.       
         Dr. Esther Thelen, a psychologist whose research into the way babies develop early motor and mental skills exerted a powerful influence in the field, died on Dec. 29 at a hospital in Bloomington, Ind. She was 63.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Jennifer Thelen of Richmond, Calif.         Dr. Thelen, a psychology professor at Indiana University, was known for studying childhood development through the conceptual framework called dynamic systems theory. Many psychologists had once believed that babies developed on a relatively rigid timetable, dictated by changes in the brain. But Dr. Thelen proposed that developmental milestones occurred through a complicated interaction involving the brain, the environment, the baby's growing awareness of its body and other factors.         ''She had a profound impact on the way people think about how kids develop,'' said Dr. John Spencer, a psychology professor at the University of Iowa, a friend and former colleague of Dr. Thelen's. ''She really viewed development at the level of the organism, the whole child, and showed that it's not just the genes or the brain but all these things coming together.''         Dr. Thelen also proposed that environmental experiences in the first year of life played an enormous role in shaping the neuronal networks in the brain that determine much of a growing child's abilities -- intellectually, creatively and in other ways.         Dr. Thelen was born on May 20, 1941, in Brooklyn. She attended Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, and in 1977 she received a doctorate in biology from the University of Missouri. She was a member of the university's psychology department until she left for Indiana in 1985.         In addition to her daughter, Dr. Thelen is survived by her husband, David, a history professor at Indiana; a son, Jeremy, of Providence, R.I.; a sister, Harriet Saeck of Sacramento; and one grandson.       
         Joanne Grant, an activist who documented the grassroots efforts behind the civil rights movement through her journalism, filmmaking and commentary, died on Sunday at St. Vincent's Midtown Hospital. She was 74 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was heart failure, her son, Mark Rabinowitz, said.         Ms. Grant wrote ''Black Protest'' (Fawcett, 1968), a documentary analysis of black resistance from 1619 on. One of the first books to trace the origins of the civil rights movement, it remains required reading in many classes on African-American history.         A former assistant to W.E.B. DuBois, Ms. Grant sought to profile the struggle for civil rights through its community leaders. Her award-winning documentary film ''Fundi: The Story of Ella Baker'' (1981), about an unsung matriarch of the civil rights movement, was broadcast nationally on PBS. She later wrote ''Ella Baker: Freedom Bound'' (Wiley, 1998), a biography. In ''Confrontation on Campus'' (New American Library, 1969), she described sit-ins at Columbia University and elsewhere.         ''She was an important voice in the early writing on the civil rights movement,'' said Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, a professor of African-American studies at Harvard. ''Scholars began to realize that you couldn't understand how this became a national phenomenon unless you understood how communities rallied around issues.''         Friends described Ms. Grant as the movement's publicist and said she saw herself as both journalist and advocate. She was a member of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee in the 1960's and in later years organized benefits for social causes and political candidates.         In the 1960's, as a reporter for The National Guardian, she often traveled to rural Southern towns to describe demonstrations and organizations that other publications largely ignored.         ''She exposed and explained the civil rights movement in ways that the daily press either couldn't or wouldn't,'' said Julian Bond, chairman of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.         Joanne Grant Rabinowitz, whose father was white and mother biracial, was born in Utica, N.Y., on March 30, 1930. She graduated from Syracuse University with a degree in history and journalism.         In addition to her son, Mark, of Manhattan, she is survived by her husband, Victor, a lawyer and activist; a daughter, Abby, of Hamburg, N.J.; a stepson, Peter, of Clinton, N.Y.; a stepdaughter, Joni, of Pittsburgh; a half-sister, Mary Jane Hubbard of Norwich, N.Y.; a half-brother, James Hubbard of Orlando, Fla.; and two step-grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth Janeway, who began her career as a best-selling novelist in the 1940's and later distinguished herself as a critic, a lecturer and an early advocate of the women's movement, died yesterday at a retirement home in Rye, N.Y. She was 91.         Her death was reported by her son Michael Janeway, a writer and editor who is a professor at the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism.         Most of Ms. Janeway's earlier books were novels that focused on family situations and occasionally the pressures on women of modern society and were cited for their psychological acuteness and good sense. All the while, she reviewed books for The New York Times and other newspapers, and was credited for helping to introduce English writers like Anthony Powell to an American audience and for defending the artistic merits of ''Lolita,'' by Nabokov.         In the 1970's, she began to write nonfiction books about feminist issues: ''Man's World, Woman's Place: A Study of Social Mythology'' (Morrow, 1971), ''Between Myth and Morning: Women Awakening'' (Morrow, 1974), ''Powers of the Weak'' (Knopf, 1980) and ''Improper Behavior'' (Morrow, 1987), among others.         Despite her conventional-seeming role as a wife and mother, she was always staunch in her support of feminism, remaining friends with women like Betty Friedan, Gloria Steinem and Kate Millett, her son said. Reviewing ''Between Myth and Morning'' in The Christian Science Monitor, June Goodwin wrote: ''Of all the writers on the subject of feminism,'' Ms. Janeway ''has the most acceptability in the eyes of men. She has credentials, she is married to a successful man'' -- the economist and writer Eliot Janeway -- ''has children; as recently as 1969 she termed the women's movement 'frivolous and gestural.'''         Ms. Goodwin concluded that women ''need to read books'' like this ''to have their thoughts and experience confirmed and thus to be reinforced for action.''         Elizabeth Hall Janeway was born Oct. 7, 1913, in Brooklyn, the granddaughter of an Episcopal minister and the younger daughter of Charles H. Hall, a naval architect, and Jeanette F. Searle Hall.         After graduating from the Shore Road Academy in Brooklyn, she spent a year, 1930-31, at Swarthmore College. Her son said that because the Depression wiped out her family's savings, she broke off her education to spend a year writing advertising copy for a department store, Abraham & Straus, and handling orders for the Book of the Month Club.         She then went to Barnard College, taking her B.A. degree in 1935.         In 1938, she married Mr. Janeway, who died in 1993. Their second son, William Hall Janeway, a financial executive, also survives her.         In 1943, she published her first novel, ''The Walsh Girls'' (Doubleday), about two New England sisters, one of whom rejoins the other after her German husband's death in a concentration camp. The book was praised by John Dos Passos, and it became a best seller. Six more novels followed, among them ''Daisy Kenyon'' (Doubleday, 1945), which was made into a movie starring Joan Crawford; ''Leaving Home'' (Doubleday, 1953; reissued by CUNY, 1987); and ''Accident'' (Harper & Row, 1964), as well as several books for young people and collections on writing that she edited.         Ms. Janeway was also active on behalf of writers, serving as president of the Authors Guild from 1965 to 1969, a longtime member of the executive board of the American Center of Poets, Essayists and Novelists, a member of the board of directors of the McDowell Colony, and a judge for both the National Book Awards and the Pulitzer Prizes.         She was a trustee of Barnard, a fellow of Berkeley College at Yale University and a director of the Legal and Education Fund for the National Organization for Women.         Through her husband's involvement with the Roosevelt and Johnson administrations, she came to know many prominent Washington figures, including Eleanor Roosevelt, about whom she wrote profiles. At the request of Walter Reuther, the labor organizer, Ms. Janeway served as secretary of the National Committee to Aid Families of G.M. Strikers during an auto workers strike against General Motors soon after World War II.       
         Myriam J. Altman, an appeals judge of the New York State Supreme Court since 1994, died on Jan. 29 at New York University Hospital. She was 65 and lived on the East Side of Manhattan.         The cause was complications of myelofibrosis, a bone marrow disorder, her family said.         Justice Altman resigned from the bench just days before her death. She was an associate justice of the Appellate Division's far-flung Second Department, based in Brooklyn, but had her chambers in Manhattan.         A New York judge since 1978, she was appointed to the Appellate Division by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo. She was recommended several times by the Commission on Judicial Nominations for an appointment to the Court of Appeals, the state's highest court and a rung above the Appellate Division.         Myriam Jarblum was born in Antwerp, Belgium, in 1939. Her family fled Belgium and the Nazi occupation in 1941, escaping via Vichy France, Spain and Portugal and managing to reach Cuba on one of the last refugee ships.         She was 7 when the family came to the United States. She graduated from Barnard College in 1959 and received her law degree from New York University Law School in 1963. Before she joined the bench, she was in private practice and served as a law secretary in court.         She was a judge on the New York City Civil Court from 1978 to 1987, sitting as an acting justice of State Supreme Court for most of those years, presiding over civil and, later, criminal cases. She was elected a Supreme Court justice in 1987 and served in its Civil Term until her promotion to the Appellate Division in January 1994.         She was a past member of the New York State Commission on Judicial Conduct and the Ethics Commission of the Unified Court System.         Justice Altman is survived by her husband, Herbert I. Altman, a former justice of State Supreme Court; two sons,, Michael T., of Woodmere, N.Y., and Daniel, of Teaneck, N.J.; a daughter, Sarah R. Stark of Raanana, Israel; a brother, William Jarblum of Los Angeles; and nine grandchildren.       
         Sandra Dee, the perennially perky, blond-haired and blue-eyed actress who helped American teenagers of the late 1950's and early 1960's cope with the frustrations of adolescent romance and the temptations of premarital sex, died yesterday at the Los Robles Hospital and Medical Center in Thousand Oaks, Calif. She was 62.         The cause of the death was complications from kidney disease, said Steve Blauner, a family friend.         Ms. Dee was probably best remembered for her portrayal of Gidget, a tomboyish California teenager who discovered the joys of surfing and boys in Paul Wendkos's 1959 film of the same name. The bright, chirpy Ms. Dee defined a new kind of natural, sun-soaked innocence that America, and much of the rest of the world, quickly embraced as the radiantly healthy, outdoorsy essence of Southern California living.         In 1960 she married the singer Bobby Darin, her costar in the 1961 romantic comedy ''Come September,'' after a whirlwind courtship. The story of her marriage to Darin, whom she divorced in 1967 and who himself died in 1973 at the age of 37, was chronicled in Kevin Spacey's recent theatrical film ''Beyond the Sea,'' in which Mr. Spacey played Darin and Ms. Dee was played by Kate Bosworth.         Ms. Dee followed ''Gidget'' with Delmer Daves's film ''A Summer Place'' (1959), in which she was paired with Troy Donohue as teenage lovers whose innocent confusion about how far their relationship should go ran up against the hypocrisy of an adult world -- a hypocrisy vividly embodied by their adulterous parents, played by Richard Egan and Dorothy McGuire. A tremendous commercial success, ''A Summer Place'' was among the earliest studio films to commodify youthful rebelliousness, though Ms. Dee was hardly an icon of adolescent revolt with her shiny helmet of flipped hair and color-coordinated outfits.         Born Alexandra Zuck on April 23, 1942, in Bayonne, N.J., she began modeling in New York at an early age. Appearances in television commercials led her to Hollywood, where she made her film debut in Robert Wise's 1957 ''Until They Sail.'' Her first substantial role came in Vincent Minnelli's romantic comedy ''The Reluctant Debutante'' (1958), in which she played the American-raised daughter of the Londoners Rex Harrison and Kay Kendall.         Ms. Dee soon proved to be as at home in melodrama as in comedy. She moved to Universal for Helmut Kautner's ''Restless Years,'' portraying the illegitimate daughter of a neurotic woman (Teresa Wright) trapped in a stifling small town. She remained at Universal for what was probably her finest sustained performance in certainly the most important of all her films, Douglas Sirk's grandly Brechtian soap opera ''Imitation of Life'' (1959).         Playing the neglected daughter of a driven, manipulative Broadway star (Lana Turner), Ms. Dee projected a genuinely touching fragility, and convincingly turned on her uncaring mother in one notable scene. ''Imitation of Life'' was Universal's biggest success of the 1950's, and prompted the studio to reunite Ms. Dee and Turner in the garish crime thriller ''Portrait in Black.''         Although Universal kept pushing her into teenage roles --as the barefoot, backwoods heroine of ''Tammy, Tell Me True'' (1961) and ''Tammy and the Doctor'' (1963, opposite an equally innocent young Peter Fonda) -- her widely publicized marriage to Darin made her seem less acceptable as an adolescent. In addition to ''Come September,'' Ms. Dee starred with her finger-snapping husband as a jealous young wife in ''If a Man Answers'' (1962) and as a maid posing as a successful publisher in ''That Funny Feeling'' (1965). In between, however, Ms. Dee returned to teenage roles, playing James Stewart's peacenik daughter in ''Take Her, She's Mine'' (1963).         After her troubled marriage to Darin came to an end, Ms. Dee seemed to lose interest in her acting career. Growing too old to play the perfect teenager (as she did again in the 1967 ''Rosie!''), she failed to make a convincing transition to adult roles, and soon she was appearing in small parts on television series. Her last starring role was in the low-budget film ''The Dunwich Horror'' (1970).         Ms. Dee is survived by her son, Dodd Darin, and two granddaughters. In 1994, Mr. Darin published, with Maxine Paetro, ''Dream Lovers: The Magnificent Shattered Lives of Bobby Darin and Sandra Dee,'' an account of his parents' relationship.         Correction:  February 23, 2005, Wednesday  An obituary of the actress Sandra Dee on Monday misspelled the surname of her co-star in ''A Summer Place'' and misstated the color of her eyes. The co-star was Troy Donahue, not Donohue, and her eyes were brown, not blue.       
         Uli Derickson, the Trans World Airlines flight attendant honored for saving passengers' lives in 1985 by both confronting and mollifying terrorist hijackers, died on Friday at her home in Tucson. She was 60.         Ms. Derickson was still working as a flight attendant for Delta Air Lines when she received a diagnosis of cancer in 2003, her son, Matthew Derickson, said in announcing her death.         On June 14, 1985, when a pair of Lebanese gunmen commandeered a T.W.A. flight from Athens to Rome, Ms. Derickson took the lead in protecting the 152 passengers and crew members.         Though the two hijackers spoke almost no English, Ms. Derickson was able to speak with one of them in German and occasionally calm him by singing a German ballad he requested. She won the hijackers' pity for one passenger by explaining that his daughter had been delivered by a Lebanese doctor.         She also intervened during beatings, often putting herself in harm's way.         ''Don't you hit that person,'' she would shout, a passenger later told The New York Times. ''Why do you have to hit those people?''         When a ground crew in Algiers refused to refuel the plane without payment, even when faced with the terrorists' threat to kill passengers, it occurred to Ms. Derickson to offer her Shell credit card. The ground crew charged about $5,500 for 6,000 gallons of fuel.         The most terrifying moment for her, she later told Glamour Magazine, was when the crueler of the two hijackers asked her to marry him.         At one point they asked Ms. Derickson to sort through the passengers' passports to single out people with Jewish-sounding names. Although various news organizations initially reported that she had followed their orders, she in fact hid the passports, her son said. ''Everybody looked to her for courage and guidance,'' Tom Cullins, an architect in Burlington, Vt., who was a hostage on the plane, said in an interview yesterday. ''She was clearly in control. She even made demands of the hijackers.''         Mr. Cullins added, ''We have nothing but the utmost respect for her and a debt of gratitude for really heroic acts.''         After about 36 hours, the terrorists released a second wave of hostages, including Ms. Derickson and 65 others, in Algiers. They had already killed a Navy diver, Robert D. Stethem, but his was to be the only death. The hijackers released other hostages over the next 15 days, with the ordeal ending for the last 39 on June 30. It ended after Israel's release of 31 Lebanese prisoners, a fraction of the 766 the hijackers had demanded.         Ms. Derickson became the first woman to receive the Silver Cross for Valor, awarded by the Legion of Valor, a veterans organization. ''The Taking of Flight 847: The Uli Derickson Story,'' a 1988 movie that appeared on NBC and featured Lindsay Wagner as Ms. Derickson, received five Emmy nominations.         Ulrike Patzelt was born on Aug. 8, 1944, in Aussig an der Elbe, Czechoslovakia, near the German border, and was raised in Bavaria. She worked as an au pair in Britain and Switzerland before immigrating to Connecticut in 1967.         She began working for T.W.A. a few years later and joined Delta in the early 1990's.         Her husband, Russell G. Derickson, a former pilot, died in 2003. She is survived by her son, of San Diego, and her mother, Marianne Patzelt of Nuremberg, Germany.       
         Gwendolyn Knight, a painter and sculptor from the 1930's who emerged from the shadow of her husband, the painter Jacob Lawrence, late in her life, died on Feb. 18 at her home in Seattle. She was 91.         Although Ms. Knight did not begin to exhibit formally until the 1970's and was long known as the wife of Mr. Lawrence, a leading visual chronicler of the African-American experience, she began painting when she was young and was still setting out in new directions in old age.         This was evident in her first retrospective, titled ''Never Late for Heaven: The Art of Gwen Knight,'' at the Tacoma Art Museum in 2003. Having devoted most of her career to oil portraits of friends, figure studies of dancers, and watercolor and gouache landscapes that seemed to be companion pieces to her husband's work, she suddenly began in the 1990's to draw horses and cats from memory -- quick, lyrical sketches rendered as etchings and monoprints.         ''It wasn't necessary for me to have acclaim,'' she told Charles H. Rowell in an interview for Callaloo magazine in 1988. ''I just knew that I wanted to do it, so I did it whenever I could.''         Gwendolyn Clarine Knight was born in Bridgetown, Barbados, on May 26, 1913, the only child of Malcolm and Miriam Knight. Her father died when she was 2. In 1920, she traveled with a foster family to St. Louis, Mo., and then to New York City when she was 13.         After graduating in 1930 from the Wadleigh High School for Girls, an integrated school in Harlem, she spent two years at the Howard University School of Fine Arts, where she was encouraged by her teachers but had to drop out because of the Depression.         Returning to Harlem, she met the sculptor Augusta Savage, who became her mentor and obtained support for her from the Works Progress Administration. While taking classes at the Harlem Community Art Center she met Mr. Lawrence, whom she married in 1941.         She followed him when he taught at Black Mountain College in Ashville, N.C.; Brandeis University in Boston; and Skowhegan School of Painting and Sculpture in Maine. In 1949, when Mr. Lawrence was hospitalized with depression, she worked for a time for Condé Nast publications.         In the early 1960's, the couple lived in Nigeria, whose native arts influenced Ms. Knight. In 1971, they moved to Seattle, where Mr. Lawrence took a teaching position at the University of Washington School of Art and Ms. Knight had her first one-woman exhibition in 1976. Mr. Lawrence died in 2000.       
         Mary Kim Joh, a composer and medical researcher, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan, said her son, Insoo Joh. She was 101.         Ms. Joh is best known for ''School Bells,'' a 1945 anthem that must be learned by all students going into grammar school today in South Korea. She was asked by the South Korean government to compose children's songs after Japanese occupation ended and her nation was left with no Korean-language school materials.         Born in Seoul, Ms. Joh attended American missionary schools and graduated from Ewha Women's University, where she eventually became director of the music department after earning a master's degree in music at the University of Michigan. She taught music theory and composition in the United States before switching her profession to microbiology and biochemistry, receiving a master's degree in science from Wayne State University. In 1977, at 73, she joined the Peace Corps and worked in Liberia, in a hospital 600 miles from Monrovia.         She moved to New York in 1978 and worked with Korean-Americans there after Americans were evacuated from Liberia. In 1980 she received an honorary degree from Ewha for her humanitarian work in the United States and Africa, where she began a program called ''Spoons for Liberia,'' which sent sanitary utensils to the country in an effort to curb tropical diseases there. A program of financial grants was also established in her name to help talented teenagers become medical technicians.         Distressed to find there were no books on Korean music in American libraries, Ms. Joh also wrote ''Folk Songs of Korea,'' published by Wm. C. Brown Company Publishers, Iowa, in 1950.         Ms. Joh's husband, Owen, died in 1975. In addition to her son, Insoo, of Manhattan, she is survived by a daughter, Gwin Joh Chin, a magazine production editor at The New York Times, and a granddaughter, Andria Meredith, both of Manhattan, and a grandson, Eric, of Greensboro, N.C.       
         Connie Scovill Small, known in maritime circles as the First Lady of Light for the decades she spent helping illuminate the night as the wife of a lighthouse keeper on the rugged New England coast, died on Jan. 25 at a nursing home in Portsmouth, N.H. She was 103.         Her death was announced by the American Lighthouse Foundation, of Wells, Me.         Active in the lighthouse preservation movement until shortly before her death, Mrs. Small lectured widely on her vanished way of life. Her memoir, ''The Lighthouse Keeper's Wife,'' first published when she was in her mid-80's, was reprinted by the University of Maine Press in 1999.         ''In the 19th century and early 20th century, any kind of state or federal policies that were made about lighthouse service included an understanding that women were part of that service,'' Andrea Constantine Hawkes, a historian who edited Mrs. Small's memoir, said in a telephone interview. ''And the government truly expected women to do these things and receive no money and no recognition.''         From 1920 to 1948, Mrs. Small worked alongside her husband, Elson, as he tended lighthouses in Maine and New Hampshire for the United States Lighthouse Service, later part of the Coast Guard. It was a solitary calling; most of the lighthouses to which the couple were posted were on tiny, windswept islands several miles off the coast. The work, Mrs. Small wrote, was ''a life of people risking their own lives to help men and ships; a life of order and duty.''         Every evening before sunset the couple lighted the lamp by hand, lugging cans of fuel up the tower stairs, trimming wicks, cleaning soot. They rose at dawn to extinguish the light. They endured lashing storms, injury and illness. In their first posting, Lubec Channel Light in northeastern Maine, they reached their quarters by way of an iron ladder on the outside of the tower that was slick with ice in winter. It was a 30-foot drop to the rocks below.         But for Mrs. Small, there were ample pleasures: correspondence courses from Betty Crocker, fresh clams dug up outside the house, friendships with summer visitors and the rough-hewn crew of a fishing boat who lumbered into her living room one day demanding to hear an opera on the radio.         Constance Scovill was born on June 4, 1901, in Lubec, Me., the easternmost town in the United States. The sea was in her blood: her grandfather was a captain, an uncle was a lighthouse keeper and her father was on the crew of the lifesaving station at nearby Quoddy Head. But Mrs. Small was afraid of the water and never learned to swim. She was also afraid of heights.         She married Elson Small in 1920, and for their first 28 years together they lived in keeper's quarters, some at the base of a lighthouse, others in the tower itself. There was seldom a telephone, electricity or plumbing.         Before Mr. Small retired in 1948, the couple also served at Seguin Light and St. Croix River Light in Maine, and Portsmouth Harbor Light in New Hampshire. After her husband's death in 1960, Mrs. Small worked in a Portsmouth department store and later as a head resident at Farmington State College in Maine. No immediate family members survive.         Automation has made the couple's work obsolete. Except for a largely ceremonial position at Boston Light, there are no more lighthouse keepers in the United States, according to the Lighthouse Foundation. The lights turn on by themselves.         ''I loved being in the tower at sunset,'' Mrs. Small wrote. ''When I took that lens cover off and the light flashed, I could begin counting from Portland to Pemaquid Point as almost simultaneously the lights came on -- 13 of them. It was like saying 'hello,' 'hello,' 'hello,' 'hello,' all down the coast.''       
         Phyllis W. Meadow, a psychoanalyst who worked to liberalize training and licensing in her field, died on Jan. 19 at St. Vincent's Hospital Manhattan. She was 80 and lived in Brookline, Mass., New York City and Dummerston, Vt.         The cause was gallbladder cancer, said her daughter, Dr. Dena Reed, who is also psychoanalyst.         At a time when the largest psychoanalytic professional association in the United States required psychoanalysts to have medical training, Dr. Meadow, whose doctorate was in human relations, actively sought to open the training of psychoanalysts to those without a medical degree. Their mission placed them at odds with many psychoanalysts, who felt that opening the field to lay analysts might lower standards.         In 1988, the American Psychoanalytic Association, in response to a restraint-of-trade suit by psychologists, agreed to open psychoanalytic training to candidates without medical degrees.         Dr. Meadow felt that ''any qualified person with a B.A. should be eligible to pursue training in psychoanalysis,'' said Jane Snyder, dean of graduate studies at the Boston Graduate School of Psychoanalysis, an alternative training program that Dr. Meadow founded in 1973.         Two of her chief missions, Dr. Snyder said, were to create greater diversity among the kinds of patients being treated and to reduce the number of therapeutic sessions from three to five a week to one or two.         Dr. Meadow taught, wrote, edited, practiced therapy, and founded and led organizations, including the Center for Modern Psychoanalytic Studies in Manhattan, along with its branch, the Cyril Z. Meadow Institute of Psychoanalysis, in Dummerston. This was named for her husband, who founded the New York Center with her and who died in 1998.         Watersheds in Dr. Meadow's campaign, Dr. Snyder said, were 1994, when the Boston Graduate School became one of the first institutions in this country to grant a master's degree in psychoanalysis, and 1999, when the Vermont branch was able to offer a doctorate.         Dr. Meadow also lobbied successfully to liberalize laws regulating the training of psychoanalysts, both federally and in New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts, Vermont, California and other states.         Phyllis Whitcomb was born in Boston on April 12, 1924, the oldest of three daughters of George Whitcomb, a printing and publishing salesman, and Marjorie Loring Whitcomb, who became Gen. Omar Bradley's administrative assistant during World War II. She attended Watertown High School and earned a B.A. from the University of Maryland in 1946.         After working as a magazine writer and editor in New York City, she did clinical work at the National Psychological Association for Psychoanalysis, founded by Theodore Reik, receiving certification as a psychoanalyst in 1962. She got her doctorate from New York University in 1969.         Among her books are ''The New Psychoanalysis'' (Rowman & Littlefield, 2003) and ''Ethics for Psychoanalysis: In the Interest of the Patient'' (forthcoming from International Universities Press).         Besides her daughter, her survivors include two sisters, Susan Winbourne of Sudbury, Mass., and Jessie Roland of Navarre, Fla., and three grandchildren.       
         Eleanor Gould Packard, whose questions, comments and admonitions on the proofs of thousands of articles for The New Yorker for 54 years defined for many the care (some writers said obsessiveness) taken in editing the magazine, died Sunday in Manhattan. She was 87.         Her death was announced by her daughter, Susan Hathaway Packard.         Miss Gould, as she was known to the staff, challenged the logic, syntax, grammar, flow, usage, punctuation and vocabulary of a legion of nonfiction writers: E.B. White, Roger Angell, Wolcott Gibbs, Ved Mehta, Pauline Kael, Philip Hamburger, John McPhee, Lillian Ross. Many at The New Yorker believed the precisely penciled Gould proofs sustained its suavity of style.         David Remnick, the magazine's editor, once said: ''I think if there is an indispensable person here, it's Eleanor Gould. The relationship to her is as intimate as it gets; she has been inside my sentences.''         Invoking Harold Ross, the magazine's founding editor, Mr. Hamburger said, ''It is my impression that she brought to fruition an idea that Ross had, that everything should be looked at by a skeptical eye, not a cynical one, before it was presented to the public.''         Mr. Hamburger, who was interviewed several years before his death, sighed a little. ''Such probity and intelligence,'' he said.         Miss Gould's own view of her work was less glorified: ''I just try to make things right.''         Her work was not easily encompassed in a job title, and the magazine never saw a need to give her one. She was not a fact-checker, though she did find errors. She was not a story editor, copy editor or proofreader. She did not enter the process until an article had been examined by lawyers and editors and was in galley proof, close to the last minute. She worked her way down both margins, penciling corrections and suggestions in a legible hand, always providing her rationale.         ''A miracle to watch,'' said Edith Iglauer, an editor who once worked with her. ''The words danced across the page.''         As all editors know, showing such a thing to a tetchy or insecure writer might induce a tantrum. ''Not every writer gets to see a Gould proof,'' Mr. Angell said while she was still on the job. ''It's a challenge. You have to take a Gould proof seriously because she is a scrupulous reader, but you have to know what to ignore.'' If everything she recommended had been carried forward, he said, ''it would be like the purest water -- absolutely tasteless.''         Yet Mr. Remnick said on her death, ''If it's true The New Yorker is known for the clarity of its prose, then Miss Gould had as much to do with establishing that as its more famous editors and writers.''         He said that she had been greatly missed since a stroke took her off the job in 1999, but that there were still editors on the staff she had helped to train.         Miss Gould never used a computer and deadline pressure could sometimes render her handwritten work moot, especially during Tina Brown's chaotic six years as editor.         Eleanor Gould was born Oct. 3, 1917, in Newark, N.Y., to Wilson Mosher Gould, a lawyer, and Eleanor Loveland Gould. The family moved to Ohio and Eleanor graduated from high school in East Palestine, Ohio, in 1934. She won a scholarship to Oberlin and graduated summa cum laude with a major in English in 1938.         Aline Kilmer, a poet in New Jersey, became her mentor after years of correspondence Eleanor had initiated at 14. Kilmer taught her editing and helped her come to New York, and after several miserably paid editing jobs she applied to The New Yorker.         There was a myth that she flyspecked an entire issue and enclosed it with her application. But she described an application of less hubris: she noted two mistakes in recent issues, including, good Lord, a ''different than.''         She joined The New Yorker Nov. 5, 1945. Her marriage to Frederick A. Packard, also on the magazine's staff, came a year later, and the birth of their only child, Susan, a little more than a year after that. Her daughter and two grandsons survive.         In 1952, the family moved to Central Park West and 101st Street, where Miss Gould remained as long as she worked. She took a bus to the office on West 43rd Street, carrying a small lunch in an old shoe bag. For amusement, Miss Gould, who belonged at one time to Mensa, an organization of the supersmart, would factor the four-digit bus identification numbers.         In an interview in the summer of 1998, Miss Gould said she hoped to ''complete a century of Packards'' at The New Yorker. Her husband worked there for 45 years before he died in 1974. But for the stroke the year before, Miss Gould would have reached 55 years in 2000.         She was proud of her status. She cited the pinnacle she reached in 1972: a separate credit in ''The Elements of Style,'' the hugely popular text written by William Strunk Jr. and revived by E.B. White. The citation, which says, ''The co-author, E.B. White, is most grateful to Eleanor Gould Packard for her assistance in preparation of this second edition,'' recognized her as the linguistic equivalent of the Pope's confessor.         Interviewing Miss Gould for this obituary put the writer on the spot. Because she had been deaf since 1990, all questions had to be written; because of her status as a legendary editor, spelling counted. While asking about a Roger Angell statement, the interviewer at first wrote the name ''Angel,'' then added the second l. Miss Gould observed, ''I was going to say ''         Always the arbiter, she added, with amusement, ''I'll have to stage a faked death and come back to correct my obit.''       
         Former Representative Tillie Fowler, who despite being the most powerful woman in Congress did not run for re-election in 2000 to keep a promise to serve only four terms, died yesterday in Jacksonville, Fla. She was 62.         She had suffered a brain hemorrhage two days earlier, a family spokesman, Tom Alexander, told The Associated Press.         Ms. Fowler was vice chairwoman of the House Republican Conference and No.5 in the House leadership when she left Congress. Her steely intelligence earned her the nickname Steel Magnolia. A member of the House Armed Services Committee, she was known for her expertise on military matters, including vigorous efforts to retain armed services bases in her Florida district.         After leaving Congress in 2001 and joining a law firm, she continued her leadership role in military matters as chairwoman of both the commission that investigated sexual abuse accusations at the United States Air Force Academy and the Defense Policy Board Advisory Committee, which advises the secretary of defense.         Ms. Fowler was also on an independent panel that last year investigated the abuse of prisoners in Iraq, attributing the problem to a string of failures that led all the way up the chain of command to the Pentagon.         She was born on Dec. 23, 1942, in Milledgeville, Ga., where her father, Culver Kidd, owned a drug store. Mr. Kidd served for 44 years in the Georgia Legislature.         A photograph in Ms. Fowler's Congressional office showed her at age 7 playing on the desk of Gov. Herman Talmadge of Georgia. She recalled that she was arguing with him.         She earned a law degree from Emory University, where she also did her undergraduate work. She later worked as a Congressional aide and in the Nixon White House, in consumer affairs. In 1971, she moved to Jacksonville with her husband, Buck Fowler.         She threw herself into volunteer work, then used those contacts to run successfully for the Jacksonville City Council. Elected president of the Council, she had three members arrested in 1989, when they tried to walk out of a meeting, which would have prevented a quorum needed to pass the city budget.         In 1992, she ran for Congress, promising to serve no more than four terms. She received 57 percent of the vote and was unopposed in her next three races.         She got a seat on the Armed Services Committee and was elected co-chairwoman of the Freshman Republican Task Force on Reform. In her second term, she became a deputy whip for the Republicans. In late 1996, Speaker Newt Gingrich gave her and Representative Jane Harman, Democrat of California, the tough assignment of investigating sexual harassment in the Army.         In 1998, Ms. Fowler was elected vice chairwoman of the House Republican Conference on the vow that she would serve no longer than two years in the Republican leadership. She filed papers in 1999 to seek re-election, but later decided to keep her initial promise.         She is survived by her husband and her daughters, Tillie Anne, of Washington, and Elizabeth, of California.       
         Elsa H. Zion, a city official and former publishing executive who campaigned successfully to regulate the workload of interns and residents in New York State's hospitals after the highly publicized death of her daughter, Libby, in 1984, died on Thursday at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York. She was 70 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was complications of breast cancer, said her husband, the journalist Sidney Zion.         For a decade, until shortly before her death, Ms. Zion was the deputy director of the Bureau of Senior Services, Resources and Partnerships at the New York City Department for the Aging. She was previously an assistant to Andrew J. Stein, then the City Council president.         Libby Zion was 18 when she died in New York Hospital on March 5, 1984, having been admitted eight hours earlier with a high fever. In 1987, a grand jury report cited errors that it said could have contributed to her death. These included being given a painkiller that can interact lethally with the antidepressant drug that she had told doctors she was taking and remaining unmonitored by a doctor for four hours, during which time her temperature rose to 108 degrees. The hospital admitted in 1987 that it had failed to provide adequate care for her, and the State Department of Health fined it $13,000.         After her death, the Zions pushed for limitations on the number of hours medical interns and residents could work each week, and in 1989, New York State adopted regulations limiting interns' and residents' hours and increasing their supervision by senior doctors.         In 1995, a jury in a negligence suit brought by the Zions against the hospital and the doctors who treated their daughter found that an intern and two other doctors had contributed to her death. The jury absolved the hospital of wrongdoing.         Elsa Ruth Heister was born in Winthrop, N.Y., on Feb. 24, 1935. She earned a bachelor's degree from Bard College and a master's in library science from the University of Chicago. In the 1970's and early 80's, she was president of Transworld Feature Syndicate.         Besides her husband, a columnist for The Daily News, Ms. Zion is survived by two sisters, Sandra, of San Francisco, and Martha, of Miami; two brothers, Karl, of Portland, Me., and Robert, of Miami; two sons, Adam, of Brooklyn, and Jed, of Manhattan; and two grandchildren.       
         Opal Petty, whose lawsuit over her 51-year involuntary commitment in Texas mental institutions led to changes in state policy, died on March 10 in San Angelo, Tex. She was 86 and lived in Christoval, Tex.         The cause was pneumonia, said Linda Kauffman, the wife of Ms. Petty's nephew, Clint Denson.         Ms. Kauffman learned by chance at a 1986 reunion of her husband's family that Ms. Petty had been committed by her family to a state hospital in 1934, when she was 16. No one at the reunion knew exactly where she was at the time, Ms. Kauffman said in an interview, only that she was in some facility near where Ms. Kauffman lived.         When she got home to San Angelo, Ms. Kauffman called the institution closest to her home -- the San Angelo State School, in Carlsbad -- and found that Ms. Petty was indeed confined there.         She began to see Ms. Petty and arranged for her to make visits to the Denson home. The more she got to know Ms. Petty, Ms. Kauffman said, the more nervous and uncooperative school officials became.         Eventually she sought legal advice and was directed to Jim Harrington, director of the Texas Civil Rights Project, who filed suit on Ms. Petty's behalf. Through pretrial discovery, it was learned that she had been given a diagnosis of schizophrenia. But her lawyers argued that at worst she had had a psychotic depression. They also said she had suffered irreparable harm from being held in a ''prison-like environment'' for so long.         Dr. Jefferson Nelson, an Austin psychiatrist, testified, based on Ms. Petty's records and a personal examination, that she was psychotic when she was admitted, but that her symptoms quickly subsided, and that she should have been released.         He also testified that as a result of being institutionalized, Ms. Petty was afflicted with an ''institutional syndrome'' that left her withdrawn and unable to express emotion.         In 1989, the jury found the Texas Department of Mental Health and Mental Retardation guilty of negligence and awarded Ms. Petty $505,000, which was reduced to $350,000 because of a state law that limits damages resulting from the actions of state employees, Mr. Harrington said in an interview.         As a result of the suit, the state made several changes, among them enacting annual hearings for all those who are confined, with the result that several other people were released from state institutions.         Ms. Petty was born on April 28, 1918, in Mills County, Tex., the third of six children of Robert Clinton Petty, a farmer, and Willie Mae Petty.         Mr. Harrington said: ''Being fundamentalist Baptists her family didn't approve of her wanting to go out dancing and such things. A church exorcism didn't work, so the family made the decision to commit her. One of her girl friends said she didn't see anything wrong with her.''         After Ms. Kauffman found her, Ms. Petty was furloughed from the state school and lived with Ms. Kauffman and her husband for almost 20 years. She was employed at a workshop for people with mental disabilities, and bought dolls to add to a collection she had started while confined.         ''They were her family,'' Ms. Kauffman said. ''When she was buried she was surrounded by her dolls.''       
         Midori Shimanouchi Lederer, who as founder and president emeritus of Japanese American Social Services Inc. helped provide social services to Asians and Asian-Americans in New York, died on March 9 at her home in Manhattan. She was 81.         The cause was respiratory failure, her husband, Peter, said.         Mrs. Lederer founded the organization in 1981. It assists the elderly, abused women, hospital patients who do not speak English and others.         Midori Shimanouchi was born in Fresno, Calif., on April 11, 1923.         At age 18, after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, she was interned with her family at Topaz, Utah. Two years later, she came to New York, where she worked as a film publicist. She later volunteered with the Lower East Side Center, which helped elderly drug addicts, and with Japanese American Help for the Aging.         The recipient of many awards, Mrs. Lederer shunned publicity, saying she did not wish to embarrass her clients.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Lederer is survived by a sister, Ida Shimanouchi, of Medford, N.J.; a stepdaughter, Patricia Lederer Michaels, of Manhattan; and one stepgrandson.       
         Lisa Fittko, who achieved fame, particularly in Germany, by leading Jews and members of the anti-Hitler resistance from Nazi-occupied France to Spain, died on March 12 in Chicago. She was 95.         The cause was pneumonia, said Evelyn Marsh, her niece.         Ms. Fittko emerged from a leftist, artistic family to become active in the resistance to Hitler in the early months of his rule, then fled to continue the fight in other European countries for seven years. For seven tense months in 1940 and 1941, she escorted refugees on a tortuous path over the Pyrenees mountains so they could go on to Spanish and Portuguese ports to seek passage to safe havens.         Many of the people she helped were intellectuals, artists and anti-Nazi organizers. The first refugee she helped was Walter Benjamin, a Marxist literary critic and philosopher whose work has drawn new interest in recent years because of his provocative insights on subjects from consumerism to surrealism.         But that initial mission was thwarted when the Spanish authorities ordered the group to return to France because they lacked proper exit visas, a requirement that had not been enforced in the past and was ignored in the future. Mr. Benjamin died at the age of 48 in Room No.4 on the second floor of the Hotel de Francia, a cheap pension in Port-Bou, Spain, on Sept. 27, 1940, having apparently committed suicide.         Ms. Fittko had earlier helped the philosopher Hannah Arendt, who had been her friend in Paris, get out of a prison in France.         Ms. Fittko and her husband, Hans, became part of the rescue mission of Varian Fry, an American who is credited with saving about 2,000 people, many of them artists and intellectuals, including André Breton, Marc Chagall and Max Ernst.         Miriam Hansen, a professor of English and cinema and media studies at the University of Chicago, said Ms. Fittko became well known in postwar Germany because Germans liked to find and honor people who resisted Hitler. She said Ms. Fittko's death was announced on German radio and television, and obituaries appeared in the major national newspapers. In 1986, the president of West Germany awarded her the Distinguished Medal of Merit, First Class.         In the United States, Ms. Fittko's story was eventually documented in several novels and films, including the 1998 documentary ''Lisa Fittko: But We Said We Will Not Surrender.''         She wrote two books about her experiences. One, ''Escape Through the Pyrenees,'' which was first published in West Germany in 1985, won that country's award for the political book of the year. It was translated into French, Spanish, Italian, Portuguese, Japanese, and, in 1991, into English by Northwestern University Press. The same press in 1993 published her ''Solidarity and Treason: Resistance and Exile, 1933-1940.''         Lisa Ekstein was born in 1909 in Uzhgorod in what was then part of the Austro-Hungarian empire; it later became part of Czechoslovakia, then part of the Soviet Union and today is part of Ukraine. Most of her childhood was spent in Budapest and Vienna; she was evacuated and sent to the Netherlands with other children for a year during World War I. After the war, her family moved to Berlin.         Through her father, a writer and a publicist for avant-garde artists there, she met many members of the Weimar intelligentsia.         While still in high school, she joined what Ms. Hansen characterized as a Communist organization. She wrote and distributed leaflets protesting torture in Nazi prisons.         At 24 she was working as a secretary and went to a rally to see Hitler. She was reprimanded for not raising her arm in salute. She told an interviewer from The Vancouver Sun in 1999 that her failure to do so was hardly intentional.         ''I was stupid, but not that stupid,'' she said.         She was soon pursued by the Gestapo, and in 1933, she fled to Prague, where she met Hans Fittko, a fellow exile and an even more committed leftist whom the Nazis sought to kill. They married on their odyssey through, among other places, Basel and Amsterdam, ending up in Paris in 1938. There, they continued helping refugees.         After Germany invaded France, Ms. Fittko was detained for a few months in a concentration camp for women at Gurs, France, along with others who had lived in Germany. It was there she aided her friend and fellow prisoner Hannah Arendt by helping to supply her with a stolen release document.         After the Fittkos found each other again, they made their way to Marseille, dodging the French authorities who were collaborating with the Germans. They planned to escape through Spain but separated because the Spanish had begun arresting men who they feared might make their way to Britain to fight Hitler.         Mr. Fittko tried to find sea passage from Marseille to Casablanca. His wife, as originally planned, had gone to the border to find a way to escape by land. In September 1940, Walter Benjamin knocked on the door of her room in Port-Vendres, saying Mr. Fittko had told him to ask her for help.         With the assistance of a local socialist mayor, who gave her an old map, she led Mr. Benjamin and two other refugees across the mountains to Port-Bou, a Spanish border town. Mr. Benjamin died there after swallowing some of the 50 morphine tablets he had earlier split with his friend Arthur Koestler.         Mr. Benjamin had been carrying a heavy, bulging briefcase that he told Ms. Fittko contained ''the only copy of his latest writing.'' She wrote that he said it was ''more important than I am, more important than myself.''         The briefcase was lost after his death and its contents remain unknown.         For years people suspected that it might have been his lost work on the Parisian arcades, iron-and-glass-roofed shopping corridors, which provoked penetrating philosophical insights on the part of Mr. Benjamin. But those papers were discovered in the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris, where Mr. Benjamin's friend the essayist Georges Batailles had hidden them from the Nazis. They were published in West Germany in 1982.         Howard Eiland, who translated them as ''The Arcades Project,'' published in 1999 by Harvard University Press, said the contents of the lost briefcase remained a mystery. He said, ''This sounds like it was something completely different that no one knows about.''         Ms. Fittko was soon joined on the French side of the border by her husband, who had not been able to find sea passage. They delayed their own escape when Mr. Fry asked them to help take refugees into Spain. They pretended to be vineyard workers and took people across the mountains on what was called the F route (for Fittko) two or three times a week for seven months. The number of those they helped is sometimes estimated in the hundreds; not one was caught, they said.         The Fittkos eventually escaped to Cuba, then went on to Chicago, where Ms. Fittko's brother lived. Mr. Fittko died in 1960, and Ms. Fittko left no immediate survivors.         She returned to Spain several times to look for Mr. Benjamin's lost briefcase, but never found it.         Correction:  March 22, 2005, Tuesday  An obituary yesterday about Lisa Fittko, the anti-Hitler activist, misspelled the surname of the French essayist who helped hide the writings of Walter Benjamin, the German literary critic and philosopher. He was Georges Bataille, not Batailles.       
         Cushing N. Dolbeare, a leading expert on federal housing policy and a longtime campaigner for affordable housing for low-income people, died on March 17 at her home in Mitchellville, Md. She was 78.         The cause was cancer, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition, the research and advocacy group Ms. Dolbeare founded in 1974.         A respected policy analyst and consultant, Ms. Dolbeare was an adviser to several secretaries of housing and urban development and was a former member of the President's Commission on Housing. In 1996, The New York Times Magazine called her ''the dean of housing advocates.''         Ms. Dolbeare founded the coalition in response to President Richard M. Nixon's 1973 moratorium on federal housing subsidies. In the organization's early days, she ran it out of her Capitol Hill home. She was its executive director from 1977 to 1984 and from 1993 to 1994; at her death she was its chairwoman emeritus.         As Ms. Dolbeare explained in an interview with The New York Times in 1983, the lack of affordable housing was for poor people a chronic problem with limited available solutions.         ''Unlike food stamps or Medicaid or welfare, low-income housing is not an entitlement,'' she said. ''Just needing it does not mean you get it.''         Mary Cushing Niles was born in Hartford on June 25, 1926, the daughter of Henry Edward Niles and the former Mary Cushing Howard. Her parents were management consultants, and Ms. Dolbeare had a peripatetic childhood as they moved around the country from one consulting job to the next. By the time she graduated from high school, she had attended 10 to 20 schools, her family said.         Ms. Dolbeare earned a bachelor's degree in political science from Swarthmore College in 1949 and began her career as a housing advocate in 1951, as associate executive secretary of the Citizens Planning and Housing Association of Baltimore. From 1965 to 1971 she was managing director of the Housing Association of Delaware Valley and, from 1967 to 1968, a consultant for the United States Commission on Civil Rights.         Ms. Dolbeare served on the President's Commission on Housing from 1981 to 1982. In 2002, she received the Heinz Award for the Human Condition from the Heinz Family Foundation; she was named a senior scholar at the Joint Center for Housing Studies at Harvard the same year.         Ms. Dolbeare is survived by her husband, Louis P. Dolbeare; a sister, Alice Lynd of Niles, Ohio; two children, L. Niles Dolbeare of San Francisco and Mary Dolbeare O'Kane of Seattle; and four grandchildren.       
         Dr. Georgeanna S. Jones, who was half of a husband-and-wife team that created the first program for in vitro fertilization in the United States and its first ''test tube'' baby, died on Saturday at a hospital in Norfolk, Va. She was 92 and lived in Portsmouth, Va.         The cause was cardiac arrest, said her husband, Dr. Howard W. Jones.         Dr. Georgeanna Jones, one of the country's first reproductive endocrinologists, was a quiet leader in her field for four decades at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, where she taught and conducted research. But she unwittingly stepped into the national spotlight when she and her husband, a gynecological surgeon, moved to Eastern Virginia Medical School in 1978 and set out to open a clinic that would allow conception outside a mother's body.         The first in vitro baby was born that same year, in England, but the procedure had never been accomplished in the United States. After three years and fierce denunciation from opponents who raised moral and ethical questions, Dr. Jones and her husband announced the birth of Elizabeth J. Carr on Dec. 28, 1981. Just slightly underweight at 5 pounds 12 ounces, Elizabeth was the first American ''test-tube baby.''         ''It was a major development, which essentially allowed I.V.F. to develop and flourish in the United States,'' said Dr. Zev Rosenwaks, who trained under the Joneses and directs the Center for Reproductive Medicine and Infertility at NewYork-Presbyterian/Weill Cornell.         The news quickly led to a flood of attention, kindling hope in infertile couples around the country and prompting many doctors to converge on Norfolk to learn the procedure. More than 114,000 babies have since been born through in vitro fertilization in the United States, about 3,000 of them at the clinic in Norfolk now called the Jones Institute for Reproductive Medicine.         ''Literally right after they succeeded, every doctor interested in the field marched through Norfolk,'' said Sherry Sontag, the author of a coming book, ''One in a Million: A History of I.V.F. and the Quest to Make One Tiny Baby.'' ''They trained many of today's leading experts, and those they didn't train were taught by their students.''         Dr. Jones is widely credited with inspiring generations of women in medicine. She lectured, wrote some 350 scientific articles and worked closely with many of the patients at her clinic. Slowly progressing Alzheimer's disease restricted her in the 1990's, but she kept an office at the institute and never lost touch with the first crop of children whose lives began in her laboratory.         ''I always joked that they were like my second set of grandparents,'' said Ms. Carr, who is 23 now and lives in St. Petersburg, Fla., working as an online reporter for the Poynter Institute. ''They would call me every Christmas and birthday. For a while, all of the I.V.F. babies born at the clinic would travel down there for Mother's Day reunions. We all feel like brothers and sisters.''         Ms. Carr says she wears a silver pendant, engraved with her initials and the number one, given to her by the Joneses.         Born in Baltimore on July 6, 1912, Georgeanna Seegar earned her undergraduate degree from Goucher College there and her medical degree from Johns Hopkins. She was the daughter of an obstetrician, Dr. J. King Seegar, who also delivered her future husband.         In 1939, while at Johns Hopkins, Dr. Jones helped establish and lead the first division of reproductive medicine in the country. Several decades later, she identified a disorder, called luteal phase defect, that causes deficiencies in the hormone progesterone and sometimes leads to miscarriages.         In 1978, Dr. Jones and her husband left Johns Hopkins for Eastern Virginia Medical School shortly after the birth of the world's first in vitro baby was announced in England. The couple had not intended to open a clinic until a former patient of Dr. Georgeanna Jones, after reading about the birth, sent the Joneses a grant for $5,000 and encouraged them to do the same. They agreed, but almost backed out when opponents questioned whether the procedure would lead to selective breeding and the destruction of embryos.         ''We only went ahead with it because the board of trustees at the medical school said, 'We're behind you, go ahead,''' Dr. Howard Jones said yesterday.         Within a year of Elizabeth Carr's birth, the Joneses had helped deliver about 10 more in vitro babies.         ''Despite the controversy,'' said Ms. Sontag, the writer, ''Georgeanna never lost sight of the fact that the most important part about I.V.F. was making babies.''         In addition to her husband of 64 years, Dr. Jones is survived by two sons, Dr. Howard Wilbur Jones III of Nashville and Lawrence Massey Jones of Denver; a daughter, Dr. Georgeanna Jones Klingensmith of Denver; a brother, King Seegar of Towson, Md.; a sister, Elizabeth Seegar of Silver Spring, Md.; seven grandchildren; and one great-grandson.       
         Isabelle Goldenson, who worked for people with disabilities, including her oldest daughter, as a founder of United Cerebral Palsy, died on Feb. 21 at her home in Sarasota, Fla. She was 84.         Her death was announced by her family.         People with disabilities were often separated from their families and institutionalized at the time that Mrs. Goldenson and her husband, Leonard H. Goldenson, former head of ABC, were raising their daughter Genise.         In 1945, the Goldensons and another couple, Jack and Ethel Hausman, reached out to other parents of children with cerebral palsy by placing an advertisement in The New York Herald Tribune. United Cerebral Palsy was founded in 1949.         Mrs. Goldenson and her husband lobbied for wheelchair access to sidewalks and restrooms; donated at least $60 million to research on neurological diseases; and even recruited NASA to their cause.         ''If we can put a man on the moon,'' she asked at a dinner party in 1971, ''why can't we develop a lightweight wheelchair for people with disabilities?'' NASA engineers soon constructed such a wheelchair as well as medical monitoring equipment.         In 1955, Mrs. Goldenson convinced Dr. Sidney Farber of the need for research toward preventing cerebral palsy. He recruited 14 other medical scientists for what became the United Cerebral Palsy Research and Educational Foundation.         Through its network of affiliates, United Cerebral Palsy provides daily services to more than 30,000 people.         Isabelle Charlotte Weinstein was born in Manhattan on May 18, 1920. She attended Barnard College and Columbia University and studied at the Union Theological Seminary.         She is survived by two daughters, Loreen Arbus of New York and Los Angeles and Maxine Goldenson of Los Angeles; and a grandson. Her daughter Genise died at the age of 29 in 1973, and her husband died in 1999.       
         Barbara D. Finberg, whose management of the Carnegie Corporation of New York helped introduce educational programs for early childhood, including television shows like ''Sesame Street,'' died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 76.         Ms. Finberg, who had breast cancer, died of respiratory failure, the Carnegie Corporation said in announcing her death.         For more than 20 years, as a program officer and later as executive vice president of the Carnegie Corporation, Ms. Finberg oversaw at least $100 million in grants given by the foundation. At a time when few people saw the use of educational programs for babies and toddlers, she directed money to studies that eventually convinced policymakers of the benefits of early child development.         In 1965, seeking to finance television programming for children, she helped Joan Ganz Cooney in planning the Children's Television Workshop, maker of ''Sesame Street.''         Barbara Denning was born on Feb. 26, 1929, in Pueblo, Colo. After graduating from Stanford with a degree in international relations, she received a master's degree in political science from the American University of Beirut.         She worked for the State Department and the Institute of International Education before joining the Carnegie Corporation. After retiring from the foundation in 1996, she became vice president of MEM Associates Inc., a consulting firm for philanthropic and nonprofit groups.         Her husband of 44 years, Alan R. Finberg, former general counsel of The Washington Post Company, died in 1995. She is survived by a brother, Robert Denning, of Grand Junction, Colo.       
         Sara Stein, an influential advocate for gardening with native plants, died Feb. 25 at her home in Vinalhaven, Me. She was 69.         The cause was lung cancer, said her husband, Martin Stein.         In ''Noah's Garden: Restoring the Ecology of Our Own Backyards'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1993), Ms. Stein lamented the effects of traditional suburban landscaping on her six-acre homestead in Pound Ridge, N.Y., three acres of which were scraped in the 1930's to provide topsoil for the 1939 New York World's Fair.         She wrote how she and her husband had undertaken the process of ''ungardening,'' or changing what had become an environment of sterile lawn and plantings into carefully researched ecosystems representing swamp, prairie, rock barren and other native environments. The result attracted birds, small mammals and other wildlife.         ''Noah's Garden,'' which mingled good-humored anecdotes about her family with widely applicable advice, caught the attention of gardeners and homeowners around the country and became a bible for a growing native landscape movement. Ms. Stein was soon in demand as a speaker to gardening and environmental groups.         She followed the book with ''Planting Noah's Garden: Further Adventures in Backyard Ecology'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1997) and ''Noah's Children: Restoring the Ecology of Childhood'' (North Point Press, 2001), a meditation on the role the natural environment plays in childhood development.         Ms. Stein was born Sara Bonnett in Manhattan on Oct. 7, 1935, the second of three daughters of Earl Clough Bonnett, an insurance medical examiner, and Sara Bonnett, a psychoanalyst. She attended Cornell College for a year and earned her bachelor's degree in Russian studies at the New School for Social Research. In 1959, she married Mr. Stein, an architect.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Stein is survived by four sons, Lincoln, of Glen Cove, N.Y.; Rafael, of Ramsey, N.J.; Joshua, of Acton, Mass.; and Aram, of Richmond, Calif.; two sisters, Suzanne Caffuzzi, of Manhattan, and Diantha Guessous, of Rabat, Morocco; and six grandchildren.         Ms. Stein began her career as a toy designer, which led to her writing children's books. She started off in 1974 with a series on sensitive subjects like hospitals, dying and handicaps. The books were subtitled ''An Open Family Book for Parents and Children Together'' (Walker & Company). In 1979 she added ''On Divorce'' and ''The Adopted One'' to the series, and in 1983 ''About Phobias'' and ''Making Babies.'' The same year she published ''Girls and Boys: The Limits of Nonsexist Childrearing'' (Scribner's).         Among her other books is a series on how to raise various pets that led to ''Great Pets: An Extraordinary Guide to Usual and Unusual Family Pets'' (Workman, 1976).         Another series explained science to children and included ''The Science Book'' (Workman, 1980), ''The Evolution Book'' (Workman, 1986) and ''The Body Book'' (Workman, 1992). Ms. Stein's focus turned to gardening with ''My Weeds: A Gardener's Botany'' (1988).         Ms. Stein, who sometimes illustrated her own books, created a handmade dollhouse that was exhibited at the Museum of the City of New York for more than a year and became the basis of ''A Family Dollhouse'' (Viking, 1979).       
         Alice Thomas Ellis, a British novelist celebrated for her witty, unflinching dissections of middle-class domestic life, died on Tuesday in London. She was 72 and lived in Wales.         A spokeswoman for Ms. Ellis's literary agent, Robert Kirby, confirmed the death. No cause was given, but several British newspapers reported that Ms. Ellis had been ill with lung cancer for some time.         Far better known in Britain than in the United States, Ms. Ellis's fiction defied easy categorization. With its blend of the transcendently spiritual and the achingly mundane, her work was compared, variously, to that of Virginia Woolf, Evelyn Waugh, Iris Murdoch and Muriel Spark.         Alice Thomas Ellis was the pseudonym of Anna Margaret Haycraft, who under her real name was an editor at Gerald Duckworth, the London publishing house run by her husband, Colin Haycraft.         Under her pen name, Ms. Ellis wrote a dozen slender novels, most published by Duckworth, among them ''The Sin Eater'' (1977); ''The Birds of the Air'' (1980); ''The Summer House,'' a trilogy (Penguin, 1994); and ''Fairy Tale'' (Moyer Bell, 1998). Her novel ''The 27th Kingdom'' (1982) was finalist for the Booker Prize.         She also published several nonfiction works, including ''A Welsh Childhood'' (Moyer Bell, 1997) and ''Serpent on the Rock: A Personal View of Christianity'' (Hodder & Stoughton, 1994).         Reviewing ''The Summer House'' in The New York Times Book Review in 1994, Francine Prose wrote, ''Its quick humor, prickly ironies and lack of portentous self-importance may mislead casual readers into overlooking its true heft, its provocative and disturbing shrewdness.''         Shot through with melancholy, Ms. Ellis's novels focus on the small savageries, deep discontents and abiding grief of women's lives. Yet they are also mordantly funny sendups of bourgeois manners. Sometimes, as in the work of Shirley Jackson, the gothic overlays the domestic, to unsettling effect. Many of Ms. Ellis's characters are repellent, and they are meant to be.         A spare stylist, Ms. Ellis could sketch a devastating portrait in a single phrase. In ''The Birds of the Air,'' she describes one character, an academic, as a man whose ''insistence on ordinary language and absolute clarity of expression rendered his discourse unintelligible to the ordinary person.''         Ms. Ellis was born Anna Margaret Lindholm in Liverpool on Sept. 9, 1932, and raised in Wales. Her father and mother were devout secular humanists, and at 19, Anna rebelled by converting to Roman Catholicism.She entered a convent as a postulant, but back problems forced her to leave the order, with its requirement of physical labor. She settled in London, where she met Mr. Haycraft; they were married in 1956 and had seven children. She eventually joined him as a fiction editor at Duckworth, where her list of writers included the novelist Beryl Bainbridge.         In 1977 Ms. Ellis published her own first novel, ''The Sin Eater.'' Set in Wales, it tells of a family drawn uneasily home by the impending death of its patriarch. In The Spectator, Peter Ackroyd praised the book for ''its wit: the relentlessness of domestic life, the knives only just sheathed in time.'' Ms. Ellis's pen name, chosen perhaps for its sibilant hiss, suited her style of elegant malice.         Ms. Ellis, who also wrote on domestic life and religion for several British publications, remained a passionately traditional Catholic who deplored efforts to modernize the church. In 1996 she was fired as a columnist for The Catholic Herald after she attacked the reforms of Derek Worlock, archbishop of Liverpool, who had recently died.         Ms. Ellis is survived by four sons, William, Thomas, Oliver and Arthur, and a daughter, Sarah. Another daughter, Rosalind Mary, died in infancy, and a son, Joshua, died in an accident as a teenager. Ms. Ellis's husband died in 1994.         Throughout her work, on subjects large and small, Ms. Ellis was concerned with the futility of connection. In 1987 The Times of London asked several prominent people to compose a Valentine's Day verse. Ms. Ellis's submission began, dryly: ''Men love women/Women love children/Children love hamsters.''       
         Ellen Lentz, who reported from Berlin for The New York Times at the height of the cold war, died on April 10 at a hospital in Berlin. She was 88.         The cause was heart failure, her son, Dr. Ulrich Lentz-Bartens, said.         She was born in Berlin on Aug. 14, 1916, to a German father and a mother, Paula Pfingsthorn, who was half-American. After attending gymnasium, a college preparatory secondary school, Ms. Lentz went to work for The New York Herald Tribune. She later worked for the United Press. She joined The Times in 1959. After the Berlin Wall went up in 1961, she reported from West and East Berlin. She retired from The Times in 1981.         Ms. Lentz was married twice, first to Gustav Adolf Lentz, an engineer who died in 1947, then to Dietrich Bartens, a radio correspondent. Besides her son, whom she had with her first husband and who lives in Kiel, Germany, she is survived by two grandchildren.       
         Faith McNulty, a New Yorker staff writer who wrote many books about animals and country life for adults and children, died last Sunday at her home in Wakefield, R.I. She was 86. The cause was complications of a stroke, her sister, Elisabeth Keiffer, said.         In 1980, Ms. McNulty notably departed from her usual subjects with "The Burning Bed: The True Story of an Abused Wife" (Harcourt), an account of how in 1977 Francine Hughes, a battered Michigan housewife, killed her husband by setting him on fire after he passed out from drinking. She was acquitted of murder by reason of temporary insanity.         In 1984, the book was made into an NBC-TV movie, with a de-glamorized Farrah Fawcett as the star. The film enhanced Ms. Hughes's image as an advocate for women's rights.         But Ms. McNulty's more usual line of work was books like "The Whooping Crane: The Bird That Defies Extinction" (Dutton, 1966) and "How to Dig a Hole to the Other Side of the World" (Harper, 1979), with illustrations by Marc Simont.         Ms. McNulty came to her interests early. Although a city child, born in New York on Nov. 28, 1918, she spent her childhood summers on her grandmother's farm in Wakefield. Her father, Joseph Eugene Corrigan, was a judge. Her original name was Faith Trumbull Corrigan.         Intending to become a writer, she attended Barnard College in 1937-38, but dropped out after a creative-writing teacher told her she had no talent.         In 1938, she married Charles M. Fair, a writer. The marriage ended in divorce. In 1945, she married John McNulty. She met him about 1942, her sister said in a telephone interview, when she was one of the first three copy girls hired by The Daily News, where he was a rewrite man. He had begun to sell stories to The New Yorker, and went to work there in 1944. He helped her to sell her first piece to the magazine. A decade later, in 1953, she was hired by the editor William Shawn as a Talk of the Town reporter.         After her husband's death, in 1956, Ms. McNulty settled permanently on a farm they had bought in Wakefield and began to write books. In 1957, she married Richard H. Martin, a prop designer for the theater. He died in 1984.         In addition to her sister, Ms. McNulty is survived by a son, John Joseph McNulty of Brooklyn, and four grandchildren.       
         The Rev. Phyllis Taylor Wofford, who in 1959 was the first woman to become a minister on the staff of Riverside Church in Manhattan, died on April 4 in Norristown, Pa. She was 96. A Pennsylvania resident since 1988, she lived in Lansdale.         Her death was announced by a stepson, former United States Senator Harris Wofford.         Ordained at 50 after a career as a personnel executive in private business, Mrs. Wofford became a full-time minister at the church, doing pastoral work and acting as a liaison officer with other church organizations.         She left in 1963, when her husband, an assistant dean at Columbia University and a church deacon, accepted a post at Robert College in Istanbul.         Phyllis Taylor was born in Norwood, Mass. She grew up in Manchester, N.H., where her father, Herbert, was superintendent of schools, and graduated from Skidmore College in 1930.         She held various jobs before joining the staff of Riverside Church in 1952 to work on women's issues.         When she found herself perplexed by theological questions, Riverside's founding minister, Harry Emerson Fosdick, encouraged her to enroll at the Union Theological Seminary, where she received her Bachelor of Divinity degree in 1959.         She was ordained as a Congregational minister in what is now the United Church of Christ and then became a minister at Riverside, which is interdenominational but affiliated with the United Church of Christ and the Baptist Church .         Mrs. Wofford was active in the hospice movement in Winston-Salem, N.C., in the 1970's until her move to Pennsylvania. Her husband, Harris L. Wofford Sr., died in 1981.         In addition to her stepson, the former Democratic senator from Pennsylvania and now a resident of Washington, Mrs. Wofford is survived by a stepdaughter, Anne Wofford Towson of Shaker Heights, Ohio; another stepson, John G. Wofford of Cambridge, Mass.; 11 grandchildren; and 8 great-grandchildren.       
         Deena Burton, an expert on Indonesian dance, died April 3 at her mother's home in Queens. She was 56 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was lung cancer, said Helene Browning, a friend.         Born in New York City, Ms. Burton began her studies of Asian theater at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. She studied Indonesian dance and music at the Center for World Music in Berkeley, Calif., and at the University of Hawaii, supporting herself by working as a nightclub dancer and in a cruise-ship act, the Real Sisters. She spent more than six years studying and researching dance and dance drama in Indonesia.         Ms. Burton received a doctorate in performance studies from New York University in 2000. She organized film documentation of the seldom performed Cireonese wayang orang dance with masks in the Indonesian city of Cirebon. She edited a collection of early 20th-century films on traditional Indonesian culture at the New York Public Library for the Performing Arts at Lincoln Center and received a Fulbright scholarship to show the films to scholars and artists in Indonesia.         Ms. Burton performed with dance troupes in Java and founded the Bali-Java Dance Theater in New York City. She also choreographed and performed in Off Off Broadway theater productions and performed traditional Javanese dance and her own choreography at theaters and schools around the metropolitan area and on tour.         In addition, she taught world dance in the theater program at the Eugene Lang College of the New School University and in the theater arts department at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.         Ms. Burton is survived by her husband, Skip LaPlante; her son, Roan LaPlante; and her mother, Beatrice Soloway, all of New York City; and a half-brother, Richard Burton, of California.       
         Diane Knippers, a religious strategist who helped conservative Christians raise an increasingly loud and unified voice in the traditionally liberal bastions of mainline Protestantism in recent years, died on Monday in Arlington, Va. She was 53.         The cause was cancer, according to the Institute on Religion and Democracy, a small but influential Washington group, of which Mrs. Knippers, a laywoman, was the longtime president.         The institute is a resource center for conservative members of the mainline denominations -- primarily the Presbyterian, Methodist and Episcopal Churches -- disaffected by their churches' policies, especially on sexuality.         When the Episcopal Church consecrated its first gay bishop in 2003, Mrs. Knippers, a member of the church's Standing Commission on Ecumenical and Interreligious Relations, helped lay the groundwork for a rebellion that threatens to split the church.         Her detractors accused her of exploiting and deepening divisions in churches that need healing. But she said she was merely working to give the silent majority its say in church policy.         ''It's pretty clear that the church elite in the mainline denominations are to the left of the people in the pews,'' she told The New York Times last year.         John Green, a specialist in religion and politics at the University of Akron, credited Mrs. Knippers with changing people's ideas about what it meant to be a Protestant.         ''Prior to her activities, traditionalists within mainline denominations were mostly an afterthought or a footnote,'' he said, ''but she was able to empower them and bring them together.''         The institute shared tips on how a conservative congregation could withhold money from its denomination's headquarters, how to win seats on judicial committees and how to force heresy trials of gay members of the clergy.         Mrs. Knippers also forged new links among traditionalists in the mainline churches, Roman Catholics and the much larger network of evangelical Christians from Baptist and Pentecostal churches.         ''She was able to bring together Catholics, all kinds of Protestants and evangelicals who agree on the essential teachings of historic Christianity,'' said Roberta Ahmanson, a conservative philanthropist and one of the institute's main donors.         Mrs. Knippers urged evangelical Christians to reach across the lines of faith to their Muslim counterparts.         ''There are things we may have in common and on which we could become political and cultural allies,'' she told an interviewer in 2003, ''defending the unborn, upholding marriage, caring for refugees, advocating religious freedom.''         Mrs. Knippers also worked through the institute to raise public awareness of the persecution of Christians in Asia and Africa.         At her death, Mrs. Knippers's influence was still growing. Two months ago, Time magazine named her one of the country's top 25 evangelicals.         Mrs. Knippers was born Diane LeMasters in Rushville, Ind., in 1952, to a Methodist minister and his wife, a schoolteacher. Before earning a master's degree in sociology of religion at the University of Tennessee, she married Edward Knippers, an artist who paints biblical scenes.         After the fall of the Soviet Union, Mrs. Knippers, who became the institute's president in 1992, gave the group its domestic focus, first on radical feminism within the churches, then on homosexuality.         Hers was a level and persuasive voice. Randall Balmer, the head of the religion department at Barnard College, who called her ''one of the essential strategists for the religious right at the turn of the 21st century,'' said she came off like ''a very bright and sophisticated housewife.''         Mrs. Knippers is survived by her husband; her parents, Clarence E. and Vera LeMasters of Lakeland, Fla.; and a brother, Douglas LeMasters, of Fairfax, Va.         She was found to have cancer in 2003 but kept a demanding schedule until recently. Six weeks before her death, she appeared in Washington to promote a book of which she was co-editor, ''Toward an Evangelical Public Policy: Political Strategies for the Health of the Nation.'' While she had lost her speaking voice, Mrs. Knippers delivered a written address on the gap in religious values between Democrats and Republicans that sounded a valedictory note.         ''I'm an evangelical and I am a Republican,'' the statement read. ''But this gap doesn't please me at all because my religious convictions trump my party commitments. I want Christians to be salt and light -- a strong influence -- across the political landscape.''       
         Maria Schell, an Austrian actress who achieved international fame in Hollywood and became a major star of German-language films, died on Tuesday at her home in Preitenegg, Austria. She was 79.         The cause was heart failure, the mayor of Preitenegg, Franz Kogler, told the German news agency Deutsche Presse-Agentur.         Before she went to Hollywood in the 1950's, Ms. Schell, who was sometimes called ''the blond angel,'' was already a celebrated film figure in Austria, Germany and Switzerland, where she was often typecast as a charming girl from the Alps.         Ms. Schell was named best actress at the Cannes film festival in 1954 for her portrayal of a young doctor in ''Die Letzte Brücke'' (''The Last Bridge'') and became internationally known for her role as Grushenka in ''The Brothers Karamazov'' in 1958.         She also appeared in several American movies alongside actors like Gary Cooper, in ''The Hanging Tree'' in 1959, and Marlon Brando, in ''Superman'' in 1978.         Ms. Schell made more than 200 film and television appearances, mostly in German. She was also a prominent stage actress in Austria and Germany.         She was born in Vienna on Jan. 15, 1926, the daughter of a Swiss writer and an Austrian actress. She grew up with three siblings who all went into acting, including Maximilian, her younger brother by four years, who also became a star. In 1938, the family moved to Switzerland, where, in 1942, at the age of 16, she appeared in her first film, the Swiss ''Der Steinbruch'' (''The Quarry'').         Even though her debut was not very successful, Ms. Schell decided to study drama in Zurich. She did not make another movie until she starred in Karl Hartl's Austrian-German 1948 production ''Der Engel mit der Posaune'' (''The Angel With the Trumpet''), the first film to bring her recognition abroad.         In 2002, Ms. Schell made her last public appearance at a presentation of ''Meine Schwester Maria'' (''My Sister Maria''), Maximilian's documentary about her life.         The Austrian film critic Alexander Horwath said she was ''one of the very few stars of postwar German-speaking cinema who had a lasting impact on the international film scene,'' Agence France-Presse reported.         Ms. Schell's two marriages ended in divorce. Her first husband was the film director Horst Hächler. Her second marriage, to the Austrian actor Veit Relin, ended after 22 years in 1988. In her last years, Ms. Schell suffered several strokes and led a secluded life at her home in the Alps.         Survivors include Maximilian; her son, Oliver, from her first marriage; and her daughter, Marie-Theres, from her second marriage.       
         Marilyn Levine, a prominent ceramic sculptor known for deceptively realistic renditions of leather goods, died on April 2 at her home in Oakland, Calif. She was 69.         The cause was mucosal melanoma, said John Allen, her partner of 25 years.         Ms. Levine was born Marilyn Hayes in Medicine Hat, Alberta, in 1935 and grew up in Calgary. Interested in art as a child, she veered toward math and science, earning bachelor's and master's degrees in chemistry at the University of Alberta in Edmonton. She also married a chemist, Sydney Levine, in 1969; they divorced in 1977.         With teaching jobs for women scarce, Ms. Levine began studying art intermittently at the University of Regina. By the late 1960's, she was committed to ceramics and exhibiting frequently in Canada. In 1969, she and her husband moved to the Bay Area, where California Funk, a quasi-Surrealistic style that embraced ceramics along with goofy, exaggerated representations of daily life, was heating up. She earned a master of arts (1970) and a master of fine arts (1971) from University of California, Berkeley, whose well-known ceramics faculty included Peter Voulkos.         Ms. Levine's Funk phase included sculptures of shoes and sneakers oozing bright glaze. When a friend brought her his beat-up work shoes, she began to see old leather objects as metaphors for the passage of time and the scars of life. She developed a meticulous trompe l'oeil style, capturing in fired clay and glaze the forms, surfaces and creases of much-used luggage, gloves, hand-bags, a golf bag, a knapsack and even leather jackets hanging from coat hooks.         Along with figurative sculptors like Duane Hanson and John De Andrea, her work was initially seen as a three-dimensional equivalent of Photo Realism and was included in ''Sharp-Focus Realism'' at the Sidney Janis Gallery in New York in 1971.         But as time passed, her career unfolded mostly in the ceramics world.         Ms. Levine showed at the Hansen Fuller Gallery in San Francisco in 1971 and had her first New York show at the Bernard Danenberg Gallery in 1973. In 1974 she had the first of seven exhibitions at the O.K. Harris Gallery in SoHo. In the mid 1990's, she began to revisit her Funk beginnings with ceramic cups that appeared to be made of cut-up leather sneakers.         Ms. Levine's work is in the collections of many museums in the United States and Canada; in 1998, it was the subject of a retrospective at MacKenzie Art Gallery in Regina.         In addition to Mr. Allen, Ms. Levine is survived by a brother, Robert Hayes of Calgary.         Correction:  April 13, 2005, Wednesday  An obituary on Sunday about Marilyn Levine, a ceramic sculptor, misstated the year of her marriage to Sydney Levine, from whom she was later divorced. It was 1959, not 1969.       
         Charlotte Kempner Beyers, a documentary filmmaker whose works were among the first to introduce students to the realities of AIDS, died on March 10 at her home in Palo Alto, Calif. She was 73.         The cause was complications of lymphoma, her family said.         The producer and writer of 15 films, Ms. Beyers began her career as a print journalist, writing about science and education for a variety of publications. She made her first film, ''AIDS in Your School,'' after a brother-in-law's death from AIDS in 1985. That film, along with her later ones about AIDS, was distributed to schools and youth groups by the World Health Organization.         Ms. Beyers's other films include ''A Is for AIDS'' and ''AIDS and Women: The Greatest Gamble,'' as well as movies about drug abuse, disability and homelessness.         Charlotte Kempner was born in Manhattan on Dec. 8, 1931; her father, S. Marshall Kempner, was a prominent investment banker. She earned a bachelor's degree in English from Stanford University in 1953 and a master's in journalism from Stanford in 1968.         Ms. Beyers's first marriage, to Gerald Davis, ended in divorce. Her second husband, Robert West Beyers, died in 2002. She is survived by a sister, Phyllis Kempner; four children from her first marriage: Pamela Davis Kivelson, Nancy Stewart, Alan Davis and Cynthia Kanner; three stepchildren: Bill Beyers, Robbie Beyers and Amy Theorin; and 13 grandchildren and step-grandchildren.       
         Andrea Dworkin, the feminist writer and antipornography campaigner whose work was a lightning rod for the debate on pornography and censorship that raged through the United States in the 1980's, died on Saturday at her home in Washington. She was 58.         Ms. Dworkin died in her sleep, said her husband, John Stoltenberg. The cause of death had not been determined last night, but Mr. Stoltenberg said that Ms. Dworkin had suffered from several chronic illnesses in recent years.         With her unruly dark curls and denim overalls, Ms. Dworkin was for decades a visible presence on the lecture circuit, at antipornography rallies and ''take back the night'' marches. In speeches and in her many books, she returned vocally, passionately and seldom without controversy to the subjects of sex, sexuality and violence against women, themes that to her were inextricably and painfully linked.         Among her best-known books are ''Pornography: Men Possessing Women'' (Putnam/Perigee, 1981), ''Intercourse'' (Free Press, 1987) and ''Heartbreak: The Political Memoir of a Feminist Militant'' (Basic Books, 2002).         Reviewing ''Heartbreak'' in The New York Times Book Review, Laura Miller wrote: ''Dworkin is one of the few remaining specimens of pure countercultural Romanticism: fierce, melodramatic and utterly convinced that all truth can be found in her own roiling, untempered emotions.''         With her first book, ''Woman Hating'' (Dutton, 1974), Ms. Dworkin drew the lines in what she saw as a pitched battle against men's historical domination of women. She opposed all forms of pornography, which she believed incited violence against women. She was also critical of consensual sex between women and men, which she saw as an act of everyday subjugation in which women were accomplices.         ''One of the differences between marriage and prostitution is that in marriage you only have to make a deal with one man,'' Ms. Dworkin wrote in ''Letters From a War Zone'' (Dutton, 1989). Marriage, she added, ''is a legal license to rape.''         Andrea Rita Dworkin was born on Sept. 26, 1946, in Camden, N.J., and earned a bachelor's degree in literature from Bennington College in 1968. She later moved to Europe, where she married a Dutch political radical. The marriage was abusive, Ms. Dworkin said later, and she was divorced after three years.         ''I was a battered wife,'' she told The New York Times in 1985, ''and pornography entered into it. Both of us read it, and it helped give me the wrong idea of what a woman was supposed to be for a man.''         To Ms. Dworkin, it did not matter that some critics condemned her sweeping antipornography stance as a form of censorship. With the feminist lawyer Catharine A. MacKinnon, she wrote a municipal ordinance, briefly adopted by several cities in the 1980's, that defined pornography as a form of sex discrimination. (In 1986, the United States Supreme Court affirmed a lower court's ruling overturning the ordinance in Indianapolis.)         If Ms. Dworkin's work was unabashedly polemical, her life was full of nuanced contradictions. She publicly identified herself as a lesbian, speaking movingly about ''this love of women'' as ''the soil in which my life is rooted,'' and her work was a touchstone for many gay men and women. But in 1998, she married Mr. Stoltenberg, her companion of many years. A writer, editor and a founder of Men Against Pornography who also identifies himself as gay, Mr. Stoltenberg is her only immediate survivor.         Ms. Dworkin's other books include ''Scapegoat: The Jews, Israel and Women's Liberation'' (Free Press, 2000), ''Right-Wing Women'' (Coward, McCann & Geoghegan, 1983) and, with Ms. MacKinnon, ''Pornography and Civil Rights: A New Day for Women's Equality'' (Organizing Against Pornography, 1988). Ms. Dworkin also wrote two novels, ''Mercy'' (Four Walls Eight Windows, 1991), about serial rape, and ''Ice and Fire'' (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1987), about prostitution.         Though some critics dismissed her work as unreasoned diatribe, Ms. Dworkin remained an outspoken champion of the causes in which she believed.         ''I am not afraid of confrontation or risk,'' she wrote in ''Letters From a War Zone,'' ''also not of arrogance or error.''       
         Dr. Jeanne Petrek, a cancer researcher known for her investigations into the aftermath of breast cancer surgery, especially its impact on fertility, was killed in an accident in Manhattan on Monday. She was 57 and lived in Bronxville, N.Y.         Dr. Petrek died in surgery, hours after being struck by an ambulette while crossing the street at Second Avenue and 64th Street. At the time, she was on her way to work at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, where she directed the surgical program at the Evelyn H. Lauder Breast Center.         At the time of her death, she was also an attending surgeon in the Breast Service of Memorial Sloan-Kettering's Department of Surgery, and a professor of surgery at Cornell University School of Medicine.         Dr. Petrek was a leading expert on pregnancy-associated breast cancer and the causes of lymphedema, a swelling in the arm and hand that can develop after removal of lymph nodes under the arm. Lymphedema is one of the most common complications after the procedure.         In her 20 years at Memorial Sloan-Kettering, she treated more than 4,000 women and sought ways to provide them not just a longer life but a better one after recovery. One method she pursued was to limit the removal to only one or two lymph nodes -- the sentinel nodes, as they are known -- to which the cancer was likely to spread first, as determined by biopsy.         ''The hallmark of Jeanne Petrek's career was that she was the ultimate patient advocate,'' said Patrick Borgen, chief of the breast service. He said that while most public spending promoted the search for treatments aimed at prolonging life, Dr. Petrek hoped to improve the quality of life for cancer patients.         Dr. Borgen said Dr. Petrek borrowed a euphemism from the military, ''collateral damage,'' to refer to unwanted aftereffects of cancer therapy. Much of her work focused on the means of countering them with hormonal and other treatments.         A central question for Dr. Petrek, Dr. Borgen said, was: ''How safe was it for a young woman to get pregnant after breast cancer?''         She sought the answer in a 10-year study she was about to complete on the changes in ovarian function resulting from breast cancer treatment, like premature menopause, infertility and the overall effect on the quality of the patient's life. She followed the histories of 800 women 44 and younger who had undergone chemotherapy. About half of them were still menstruating after five years, she told The New York Times last September.         According to Memorial Sloan-Kettering, hers was the first extensive study ever undertaken of the safety of pregnancy for such women. Some preliminary findings will be reported to the American Society of Clinical Oncology in Orlando, Fla., next month, Dr. Borgen said. He said Dr. Petrek's investigation would be completed by Dr. Kimberly Van Zee, a senior researcher who had been part of it from the start.         Jeanne Petrek was born in Youngstown, Ohio. She graduated in 1969 from Case Western Reserve, where she also received her medical degree in 1973. After her internship and residency in surgery at Peter Bent Brigham Hospital in Boston, she first came to Memorial Sloan-Kettering on a surgical oncology fellowship in 1978-80.         From 1980 to 1984 she was an assistant professor of surgery at Emory University School of Medicine and was on the staffs of Grady Memorial and Emory University Hospitals. She continued her academic career at Cornell in 1984 when she returned to Memorial Sloan-Kettering as an assistant attending surgeon in the breast service of the medicine department.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. Jeffrey M. Duban; a daughter, Jean Petrek-Duban of Brooklyn; a son, Paul Petrek-Duban of Bronxville; her mother, Emily Petrek of Manhattan; three brothers, John Petrek of Bainbridge Island, Wash., Jim Petrek of Danville, Calif., and Jerry Petrek of Denver.       
         Ida Libby Dengrove, a New York courtroom artist who visualized the moods and faces of some notorious trials for the television audience, died on Wednesday while on a family visit to Los Angeles. She was 86 and lived in Ocean Township, N.J.         The cause was complications of Alzheimer's disease, her family said.         A portrait painter away from court, Mrs. Dengrove worked as a courtroom illustrator for NBC-TV from 1973 to 1986. It allowed her to take her sketch pad where cameras were forbidden and capture the proceedings in her own distinctive style.         Her pictorial reportage won two Emmy awards. She was cited for her newscast illustrations of the sensational Son of Sam trial of David Berkowitz (1977-78), and again for the Murder at the Met trial (1980-81) of Craig S. Crimmins, the stagehand convicted of slaying a young violinist, Helen Hagnes Mintiks.         She sketched the principals in the trial of Jean Harris for the murder of Dr. Herman Tarnower and documented court appearances by John Lennon, Senator Harrison A. Williams Jr., John W. Hinckley Jr., John J. Gotti and Gen. William C. Westmoreland, to name a few. Some of her sketches, meant for television, also turned up on the front pages of newspapers.         Ida Libby Leibovitz was born in Philadelphia, where she later graduated, in 1940, from Moore College of Art and Design. She taught art in the city's public school system until World War II, which she spent touring the United States for the U.S.O., sketching servicemen.         Later in her career, she taught again and lectured at various colleges and organizations.         Mrs. Dengrove's husband of 64 years, Dr. Edward Dengrove, a psychiatrist, died in 2003. She is survived by two sons, Richard A., of Arlington, Va., and Robert S., of Ocean Township; a daughter, Lois Ann, of Los Angeles; and four granddaughters.         Mrs. Dengrove herself fell victim to a crime in 1982. Eighty of her courtroom sketches were mounted in a lobby show at the United States Court House at Foley Square, a gallery of the famous in a place normally brimming with guards and federal marshals.         Yet one Monday morning, a portrait of John Lennon and Yoko Ono was gone from its place high up on a wall. She had caught the couple in pastel in 1975, when deportation charges against Lennon were dropped, and -- her usual procedure -- had kept the original after it was taped for broadcast.         ''They took it like they took the Mona Lisa,'' she noted at the time. ''They removed it from the frame and left the frame and mat on the lobby floor.''         ''Somebody must have climbed on a chair,'' she said.       
         Evelyn Annenberg Jaffe Hall, a New York arts patron for 50 years and a supporter of medical institutions, died on April 22 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 93 and also had homes in Palm Beach, Fla., and Newport, R.I.         Mrs. Hall, a sister of the late publisher Walter H. Annenberg, shared her fortune with many beneficiaries. Among her favorites were the Museum of Modern Art and the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.         Mrs. Hall was born in Milwaukee. Her parents were Moses and Sadie Annenberg. She graduated from the Calhoun School and studied at the Art Students League of New York. With her second husband, William Jaffe, she assembled an outstanding art collection that included European paintings, sculpture and antique furniture; Chinese porcelain; pre-Colombian artifacts; and Renaissance drawings.         A member of the Modern Museum's International Council since 1970, a trustee since 1979 and a leading member of various museum committees, she stood in the forefront of donors to its collections. Among the works she gave to the museum were pieces by Bonnard, Picasso, Miró and Vuillard. Another notable gift, made with Mr. Jaffe, was a selection of 16 prints by Edvard Munch.         Mrs. Hall was a benefactor of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the Brooklyn Museum as well. She financed a scholarship in art history at Yale University and in 1960 endowed the Jaffe-Friede Art Gallery at Dartmouth College.         She was also a donor to Mount Sinai Hospital, where she endowed a lecture series at the medical school.         Mrs. Hall's first marriage, to Kenneth Friede, ended in divorce. In 1947 she married Mr. Jaffe, a corporate lawyer; he died in 1972. She later married Melville Hall of Palm Beach, who died in 1991. She is survived by three sons, John Friede of Rye, N.Y., Robert Friede of Newton, Mass., and Thomas Jaffe of Manhattan; a sister, Enid Haupt of Greenwich, Conn.; three grandchildren; and four great-grandchildren.       
         Ludmilla Nikitina Shapiro, a Russian-born journalist and photographer who with her husband amassed a collection of Soviet-era political porcelain considered the most comprehensive in North America, died on May 8 in Madison, Wis., where she lived. She was 91.         Mrs. Shapiro's death was announced by her granddaughter, Alexandra Corten.         Over six decades, Mrs. Shapiro and her husband, Henry, built their collection through donations, by scouring consignment shops and by occasional gentle larceny. (Mrs. Shapiro once lifted a cigarette holder from the Kremlin.) The collection was acquired in 1989 by the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in New York.         Mr. Shapiro, a longtime Moscow correspondent for United Press International, died in 1991.         Comprising more than 250 objects made between the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 and the advent of glasnost in the 1980's, the Shapiro collection includes dinnerware, statuettes and other ceramics emblazoned with words and images intended to convey Soviet glories.         Much of the collection is magnificent kitsch. An enameled porcelain figurine from the 1960's depicts two little cosmonauts standing proudly before their spacecraft. A 1937 dinner plate, depicting a beefy young woman in a bathing suit at its center and other athletes around the rim, extols the virtues of physical fitness.         Mrs. Shapiro, who with her husband endured World War II and the terrors of the Stalinist regime in the Soviet Union, insisted that neither ideology nor aesthetics motivated the collection.         ''We didn't collect these porcelains as art,'' she told The New York Times in 1992. ''We felt they illustrated Soviet history.''         Ludmilla Nikitina was born in Moscow on June 11, 1913, to a prominent family of artists and intellectuals. She earned a degree from the Moscow Institute of Foreign Languages and another, in artistic translation, from the Gorky Literary Institute in Moscow.         In 1933, she married Mr. Shapiro, a Romanian-born American journalist. She worked alongside him as a journalist and translator, contributing articles and photographs to American and British publications. (She photographed Nikita Khrushchev, Boris Pasternak and Aleksandr I. Solzhenitsyn, among others.)         As the Moscow representative of the American impresario Sol Hurok, Mrs. Shapiro also helped persuade the Soviet government to let the Bolshoi Ballet perform in the United States, her granddaughter said.         With her husband, Mrs. Shapiro came to the United States in 1954. The couple later returned to the Soviet Union for nearly two decades, settling permanently in the United States in 1973.         Besides her granddaughter, of Madison, Mrs. Shapiro is survived by a daughter, Irina Shapiro Corten of Minneapolis, and one great-grandchild.         The Shapiros started their collection in 1933, purely by chance.         ''Henry and I were eating lunch at a skating rink, and the coffee spoons were chained to the water heaters on the table so they could not be stolen,'' Mrs. Shapiro said in 1992. ''The plates had inscriptions on them: 'Stolen From the Moscow State Eating Enterprise.'         ''I said, 'Well, then let's do what they invite us to do.' So we stole it.''       
         Raisa Struchkova, one of the Soviet Union's leading ballerinas in the Bolshoi Ballet when that company first took audiences abroad by storm in the 1950's and 60's, died in Moscow on Monday, the Bolshoi Theater announced. She was 79 and lived in Moscow.         Ms. Struchkova was highly praised at home for her classical dancing, especially in ''Giselle'' and ''Cinderella.'' But for American audiences who were stunned by the athletic vigor of the Bolshoi at its New York debut in 1959, Ms. Struchkova will always be associated with the high-flying virtuosity that she showed in Soviet-style bravura duets with her husband, Aleksandr Lapauri.         Their signature piece in this genre was ''Moszkowski Waltz,'' choreographed by Assaf Messerer. Ms. Struchkova and Mr. Lapauri, dressed in white, wowed audiences with acrobatic lifts and tosses for the ballerina and then moved to opposite ends of the stage before she raced across and threw herself into her partner's arms. Even in the 1960's, when their performances were no longer a novelty, viewers in the Metropolitan Opera House sprang to their feet in a frenzy.         Yet Ms. Struchkova's main teacher at the Bolshoi school was Yelizaveta Gerdt, the epitome of refined classical style. After Mr. Lapauri died in 1975, Ms. Struchkova retired from dancing in 1978 and coached younger ballerinas, including Nina Ananiashvili, in the 19th-century classics.         The daughter of a factory worker, Ms. Struchkova was born in Moscow on Oct. 5, 1925, and graduated from the Bolshoi school in 1944. She joined the company that year. Already noticed for what Soviet critics called her femininity as well as her strong technique, she showed off a comic gift in her first major role as Lise in ''La Fille Mal Gardée'' in 1946. Although she was not the first ballerina to dance the title role in the Bolshoi's ''Cinderella,'' choreographed to Prokofiev's score by Rostislav Zakharov in 1945, she triumphed in the part in 1947 with the expressive simplicity of her portrayal. She never achieved the international superstar status of Galina Ulanova and Maya Plisetskaya at the Bolshoi. But ''Cinderella'' made her a star.         Possibly influenced by her bravura in the showpiece duets (which included another ''Waltz,'' to music by Dunievsky), some critics in the international ballet world considered Ms. Struchkova too much of a powerhouse performer to be a model in the classics. Yet she danced the leading roles in ''Swan Lake,'' ''The Sleeping Beauty,'' ''Giselle,'' ''Don Quixote,'' and ''The Nutcracker'' and in contemporary Soviet ballets, including ''Romeo and Juliet.'' The government awarded her the order of Lenin and named her People's Artist of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.         She taught ballet from 1962 at GITIS, the State Theatrical Institute of the Arts, and from 1978 was a ballet mistress and coach at the Bolshoi. From 1981 to 1995 she was the founding editor of the magazine Ballet, originally called Soviet Ballet.       
         Carolyn Brady, an artist known for her large Photorealist watercolor paintings, died on May 5 at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. She was 67 and lived in New York City.         The cause was complications after heart surgery, said her dealer in New York, Nancy Hoffman.         Ms. Brady arrived at her signature style in the mid-1970's, when realism was enjoying a revival. She began painting flowers in vases, table settings and other scenes based on photographs that she took in and around her home. With their sharp focus, luminous colors and dimensions as great as 60 by 90 inches, her paintings have a hyper-realistic visual impact rarely encountered in the medium of watercolor.         Carolyn Brady was born on May 22, 1937, in Chickasha, Okla. She received a Bachelor of Fine Arts in painting from the University of Oklahoma in Norman in 1959 and went on to earn her Master of Fine Arts degree at the same school in 1961. She had her first solo exhibition in 1975 at Nancy Singer Gallery in St. Louis and the first of many New York solo shows at Nancy Hoffman Gallery in SoHo in 1977.         Ms. Brady's works are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; the National Museum of Women in the Arts, Washington; and the Art Institute of Chicago, among numerous other institutions.         Ms. Brady is survived by her husband, the sculptor Bill Epton, and her son, Alexander Brady Epton, both of New York City.       
         Helen Jackson Wilkins Claytor, a pivotal figure in the racial desegregation of the Y.W.C.A. and its first African-American president, died yesterday in Grand Rapids, Mich. She was 98.         Her death was announced by her son, Roger Wilkins, the Robinson professor of history and American culture at George Mason University.         Mrs. Claytor, a longtime civil rights leader in Grand Rapids, served two terms, from 1967 to 1976, as national president of the Young Women's Christian Association. As a board member and a national organizer since the 1940's, she had been a strong force in the racial integration of the organization at all levels.         Helen Natalie Jackson was born in Minneapolis and graduated Phi Beta Kappa from the University of Minnesota in 1928. She went to work for what was then the separate ''Negro'' branch of the segregated Y.W.C.A. in Kansas City, Mo., and stayed there until the death in 1941 of her first husband, Earl Wilkins, a journalist.         She then joined the newly established race relations office of the national Y.W.C.A. in New York. As secretary for interracial education, she traveled throughout the South in a campaign to desegregate the local Y's.         She became a member of the Y.W.C.A.'s board in 1945. Once she was national president, she oversaw the adoption of an amendment to the organization's constitution that buttressed the changes she had helped bring about. Its main provision warned that any local affiliate not ''fully integrated in policy and practice'' would be expelled for not living up to the Y's principles.         Mrs. Claytor moved to Grand Rapids in 1943 after her marriage to her second husband, Dr. Robert Claytor, a physician, who died in 1993.         Besides her son, who lives in Washington, she is survived by two daughters from her second marriage, Judith A. Claytor of Grand Rapids, and Sharon Claytor Peters of Lansing, Mich.; five grandchildren, and one great-grandson.       
         Betty Talmadge, a former first lady of Georgia and a prominent Washington hostess who had a second career as a businesswoman, restaurateur and cookbook author after her divorce from Senator Herman E. Talmadge, died on Saturday in Atlanta. She was 81.         Mrs. Talmadge died after a long illness, her son, Gene, said.         Mrs. Talmadge was married to Mr. Talmadge, a Democrat and the scion of a powerful Georgia political family, from 1941 until their divorce in 1977. A former Georgia governor who served four terms in the United States Senate, from 1957 to 1981, Mr. Talmadge died in 2002.         In 1979, Mrs. Talmadge testified before the Senate Select Committee on Ethics against her former husband, who was accused of improperly using campaign and office money.         As Georgia's first lady in the 1940's and 50's, Mrs. Talmadge was known for her lavish parties filled with antebellum charm. At the Talmadge family plantation in Lovejoy, Ga., 25 miles south of Atlanta, partygoers might be greeted by soldiers dressed in Confederate gray, Dixieland banjo players and the family pets, among them Rabbit E. Lee and a donkey named Assley Wilkes. In the 1960's and 70's, Mrs. Talmadge was a frequent bridge partner of Lady Bird Johnson.         She also ran a prosperous country ham business and in later years operated a restaurant out of her home. She wrote two cookbooks, ''How to Cook a Pig & Other Back-to-the-Farm Recipes'' (Simon & Schuster, 1977), with Jean Robitscher and Carolyn Carter; and ''Betty Talmadge's Lovejoy Plantation Cookbook'' (Peachtree Publishers, 1983).         Leila Elizabeth Shingler was born in Ashburn, Ga., on Sept. 17, 1923, and married Mr. Talmadge at 18. In 1947, at 24, she became Georgia's first lady for 67 days after Mr. Talmadge briefly succeeded his father, Gov. Eugene Talmadge, who had died after being re-elected but before being sworn in. Herman Talmadge was later officially appointed to fill out his father's term through 1948, when he won a special election; he went on to win a full four-year term as governor in 1950.         In the early 1950's, Mrs. Talmadge and her husband started Talmadge Farms, which cured hams. She built the company into a $6 million business before selling it in 1969.         At the end of 1976, Mrs. Talmadge learned from a television news report that her husband had filed for divorce.         In 1978, she ran in the Democratic primary for the House seat in Georgia's Sixth District. She lost the primary; Newt Gingrich, a Republican, won the general election.         In the summer of 1979, Mrs. Talmadge, who said she was testifying reluctantly, told the Senate Ethics Committee about tens of thousands of dollars in cash that her former husband kept in an overcoat in the closet of their Washington condominium. Although Mrs. Talmadge did not specify how the cash got into the coat, she testified that she and her husband had dipped into it for years whenever they needed extra money. She said she used the cash to supplement the $50 weekly allowance from her millionaire husband.         In October, the Senate voted to denounce Senator Talmadge for ''reprehensible'' official finances. He lost his bid for a fifth term in 1980.         Besides her son, of Lovejoy, Mrs. Talmadge is survived by eight grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Another son, Robert, died in 1975.         After her first cookbook appeared, The New York Times asked Mrs. Talmadge how she had found the nerve to slaughter her first pig.         ''Real easy, honey,'' she replied. ''I just thought, 'You little male chauvinist, you,' and I went to it.''       
         Louise Westergaard O'Neil, a theatrical producer best known for the hit Broadway musical revue ''Sophisticated Ladies,'' died on May 6 in New York. She was 67 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was leukemia, her family said.         Based on the music of Duke Ellington, ''Sophisticated Ladies,'' which starred Gregory Hines, Judith Jamison and Hinton Battle, opened in 1981 at the Lunt-Fontanne Theater and ran for nearly two years. Mr. Battle won a Tony Award, as did the costume designer, Willa Kim.         Ms. O'Neil, known professionally as Louise Westergaard, was one of several producers of ''Sophisticated Ladies.'' She was so confident of the show's chances that she even persuaded her mother's dry cleaner to become an investor.         She was also a producer, on Broadway, of ''Say Goodnight, Gracie,'' starring Frank Gorshin as George Burns, which ran for 10 months in 2002 and 2003, and of the musical revues ''Dream'' (1997) and ''Stardust'' (1987).         Ms. O'Neil's productions elsewhere included ''Tovah: Out of Her Mind,'' starring Tovah Feldshuh, at the Jewish Repertory Theater in 1996; and the musical ''Poppy,'' by Peter Nichols, staged by the Royal Shakespeare Company in London in 1982.         Louise Arnold was born in Manhattan on Sept. 2, 1937, and earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Chicago. She was later artistic director of Theater of the Open Eye, a New York-based company founded by the choreographer Jean Erdman and her husband, the mythologist Joseph Campbell.         Ms. O'Neil's first marriage, to John Westergaard, ended in divorce. She is survived by her husband, Stephen O'Neil, whom she married in 1989; two sons and two daughters from her first marriage, Emile, Kermit, Cathrine and Elizabeth; and three grandchildren.       
         Elizabeth McFarland Hoffman, who as poetry editor of Ladies' Home Journal sandwiched the work of W.H. Auden, Adrienne Rich and Sylvia Plath in between ''Is Your Marriage a Masquerade?'' and ''Bing Crosby's Kitchen for His Bride,'' died last Thursday in Philadelphia. She was 83 and had homes in Swarthmore, Pa., and Harborside, Me.         The cause was complications after cardiac surgery, her husband, Daniel Hoffman, said.         While Ms. Hoffman was at Ladies' Home Journal, from 1948 to 1962, the magazine published at least a half-dozen poems in each monthly issue. Major 20th-century writers whose verse appeared there included Marianne Moore, John Ciardi, Mark Van Doren, Randall Jarrell, Maxine Kumin, Edna St. Vincent Millay, Walter de la Mare, Galway Kinnell, Maxwell Anderson and John Updike.         Ms. Hoffman's own poems, published under her maiden name, also appeared in the magazine. She left Ladies' Home Journal in 1962, after its new owners stopped publishing poetry.         Elizabeth McFarland was born on May 3, 1922, in Harrisburg, Pa. As a teenager, she won a national poetry contest sponsored by Scholastic magazine; she later became Scholastic's poetry editor.         In 1948, she married Mr. Hoffman. He survives her, as do a son, MacFarlane Hoffman of Swarthmore; a daughter, Kate H. Siddiqi of Philadelphia; and two sisters, Nancy Ranew of Milton, Fla.; and Janice Volz of New York City.         The poems in Ladies' Home Journal were generally short, but Ms. Hoffman paid top rates: $10 a line. (In contrast, Poetry magazine paid 50 cents a line in the early 1950's, Mr. Hoffman, a prominent poet, said.)         Usually set in a box in the middle of a page, the poems created some arresting juxtapositions. In the August 1950 issue, ''Secrets,'' by Auden, follows an ad for Velveeta. In September 1956, ''Where the Bodies Break,'' by Mr. Kinnell, shares a page with ''How to Make 10 Tantalizing Butter Waffles With That Tender Melt-Away Texture.''         Readers of the June 1953 issue, which featured ''A Glass of Summer Daisies,'' by Jessamyn West, could, a page later, contemplate the question, ''Did you wake up today with 'morning mouth'?''         The magazine had a history of such juxtapositions. Under Edward Bok, a Pulitzer Prize-winning writer who edited Ladies' Home Journal from 1889 to 1919, it published fiction by Sarah Orne Jewett, Bret Harte and Rudyard Kipling alongside articles on childrearing, Jennifer Scanlon, the author of ''Inarticulate Longings: The Ladies' Home Journal, Gender, and the Promises of Consumer Culture'' (Routledge, 1995), said in a telephone interview yesterday.         In the 1950's, women's magazines were tantalizing readers with similar mixed signals. ''The message of the Ladies' Home Journal and magazines like that is, 'Hey, we're willing to acknowledge the choices that women have in life, but in the end, we will maintain that most women will choose home and family,''' Professor Scanlon, a historian at Bowdoin College, said. ''The magazines reveal the tensions, as well as the message, of conformity.''       
         Ruth Laredo, a pianist equally at home in chamber music and solo works who was known for landmark recordings of Scriabin and Rachmaninoff, died on Wednesday at her apartment in New York. She was 67.         Ms. Laredo, who played her last concert on May 6 at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, had cancer and died in her sleep, said her manager, James Murtha.         The concert was one of a series she had given for 17 years at the Met called ''Concerts With Commentary,'' in which Ms. Laredo played and spoke engagingly about music. The series had become an important part of the New York concert scene, where she was a frequent presence.         Just two days after the attack on the World Trade Center, Ms. Laredo celebrated the 25th anniversary of her Alice Tully Hall debut with a recital there. It was the opening concert of the 2001 Lincoln Center season, and Ms. Laredo addressed the audience beforehand, saying: ''It was important for me to play. Great music gives us spiritual sustenance and gives us hope. It is in that spirit that I play tonight.''         Ms. Laredo was a pianist in the Romantic mold, a dynamic performer concerned with texture and color. In recent years, Mr. Murtha said, her career as a soloist with orchestras had waned, but she was comfortable with a mix of recitals, chamber concerts and accompanying duties.         When she was first on the rise, in the 1970's, Ms. Laredo was a relative rarity as a female piano soloist, particularly in the technically demanding and muscular works of Rachmaninoff. There were only a few others -- Gina Bachauer, Myra Hess and later Alicia de Larrocha, for example.         ''Every time we did interviews in those early days, she was asked how does it feel to be a woman pianist,'' Mr. Murtha said. ''She wanted to be a pianist, period.''         Ruth Meckler was born in Detroit on Nov. 20, 1937. She attended the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia, where she studied with Rudolf Serkin. She graduated in 1960 and that same year married the violinist Jaime Laredo, with whom she collaborated musically. They later divorced. Ms. Laredo is survived by their daughter, Jennifer Laredo, who lives in London with her husband, the cellist Paul Watkins, and by a granddaughter.         Ms. Laredo made her debut with an orchestra in 1962, in a program led by Leopold Stokowski conducting the American Symphony Orchestra at Carnegie Hall. She made her debut with the New York Philharmonic, conducted by Pierre Boulez, 12 years later. Her Carnegie Hall solo recital debut came only in 1981.         At Curtis, Serkin schooled her in the basics of Mozart and Beethoven, turning a disapproving eye on her youthful love for Rachmaninoff. But it was with his music, as well as that of his fellow Russian Scriabin, that she made her mark.         In the 1970's she recorded two pioneering and acclaimed sets: the entire Scriabin piano sonatas, for the now-defunct Connoisseur label, and the complete solo repertory of Rachmaninoff, on seven LP's for CBS Masterworks.         When Ms. Laredo went to Serkin to ask if he thought she could handle the Rachmaninoff, he gave his blessing. '''You must do it' was the answer he gave me,'' Ms. Laredo said in a 1987 interview with The New York Times.         But preparing for the recordings was a fearsome and wearing task. ''I had to learn the many, many Rachmaninoff pieces that no one plays, and I found out why no one does,'' she said. ''It's because they're so hard.'' She later channeled her love for Rachmaninoff into scholarship, preparing a new edition of his piano preludes for the C.F. Peters music publisher.         The Scriabin LP's came when little of his music was available on record, and they helped spark a surge of his popularity in the United States. Ms. Laredo said that she first heard his music at a concert of Vladimir Horowitz and was dazzled.         Bernard Holland, a Times music critic, wrote of her playing of Scriabin's music: ''Ms. Laredo's sensuous, beautifully controlled playing caught its mad and slightly evil quality.''         Correction:  June 17, 2005, Friday  An obituary of the classical pianist Ruth Laredo on May 27 referred imprecisely to the label that issued her recordings of the Scriabin piano sonatas in 1970. It is Connoisseur Society, not Connoisseur, and it remains in business.       
         Anne Bancroft, the stage and film star whose signature triumphs in a 50-year career ranged from the courageous Annie Sullivan in ''The Miracle Worker'' to the hungrily seductive Mrs. Robinson in ''The Graduate,'' died on Monday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 73 and had homes in Manhattan and Los Angeles. The cause was uterine cancer, said John Barlow, a spokesman for Ms. Bancroft's husband, Mel Brooks.         Graced with a sultry voice and expressive mouth, Ms. Bancroft could appear both tough and vulnerable, and she eagerly sought out nearly every kind of role, maturing effortlessly over the decades. She lent a singular potency to parts as varied as Brecht's ''Mother Courage'' and the mother superior of a convent, and from an aging ballerina to Prime Minister Golda Meir of Israel. She repeatedly won praise for her work, as well as an Academy Award and two Tonys.         Arthur Penn, who directed her award-winning Broadway performances in ''Two for the Seesaw'' and ''The Miracle Worker,'' both by William Gibson, put it this way: ''More happens in her face in 10 seconds than happens in most women's faces in 10 years.'' Broadway lights were scheduled to be dimmed tonight in her honor.         Ms. Bancroft worked hard to get beneath the surface, to inhabit a role as deeply as possible. While rehearsing for her role as the young Helen Keller's teacher in ''The Miracle Worker,'' she put tape over her eyes better to understand what it was like to be blind, learned sign language and spent time at a home for the visually impaired. Preparing for ''Golda,'' she traveled to Israel and got to know and observe Meir. She was more interested in performance than theory, although she was a member of the Actors Studio early in her career. The actor Rod Steiger once gave her a copy of Stanislavsky's writings on acting. ''I still have it,'' she said some years later, ''but I've never read it.''         The landmarks in Ms. Bancroft's acting life were, unquestionably, the two Gibson plays and ''The Graduate.'' She had already accumulated a long list of credits in TV dramas when she moved to Hollywood in the early 1950's to join the crowd of young hopefuls jostling for jobs in second- or third-rate films. She was among the few who found steady work, appearing in more than a dozen grade-C features with titles like ''Treasure of the Golden Condor,'' ''Gorilla at Large'' -- ''I played the title role'' -- and ''Demetrius and the Gladiators.'' Disenchanted after five years or so, and newly divorced, she headed back to New York with the promise of an audition for a new Broadway play called ''Two for the Seesaw.''         It was a two-character play, with Henry Fonda starring as a depressed Midwestern lawyer with marital troubles who comes to New York and meets Gittel Mosca, an attractive, thoroughly quirky young bohemian girl from the Bronx. They are two lost souls who, though their life styles are worlds apart, manage to help one another. Ms. Bancroft, who happened to be not only attractive and quirky but also Bronx-born and raised, auditioned and got the job. After a rocky start -- she had virtually no stage experience -- she quickly settled into the role. When the play opened in 1958, Ms. Bancroft stole the show and ultimately won a Tony Award as best supporting actress.         When the next Gibson-Penn theater project took shape the following year -- the story of Helen Keller and Annie Sullivan -- they knew who would play Sullivan from Day 1. The part of the hostile, 10-year-old Helen went to Patty Duke. Between them, Ms. Bancroft and Ms. Duke tore up the stage as Sullivan struggled to communicate with and calm her raging young charge, eventually breaking through the child's defensive shell. ''The Miracle Worker'' was a resounding hit, and Ms. Bancroft came away with her second Tony Award, this time as best actress. Tonys also went to Mr. Penn, Mr. Gibson and the play's producer, Fred Coe. Two years, two plays, two Tonys. And when ''The Miracle Worker'' was made into a film in 1962, both Ms. Bancroft and Ms. Duke won Academy Awards.         Hollywood now had a new star, and Ms. Bancroft was offered scripts rather better than, say, ''Gorilla at Large.'' She appeared with Peter Finch in ''The Pumpkin Eater'' (1964), Harold Pinter's adaptation of a novel by Penelope Mortimer about a woman driven into a nervous breakdown by her husband's casual philandering. Her work brought her an Oscar nomination. Next came ''The Slender Thread'' (1965), in which she played a housewife whose crumbling marriage leads her to attempt suicide.         By the time ''The Graduate'' came along, she was more than ready to play the alpha female and she got her wish with the character of Mrs. Robinson, the bored predator whose sexual binges with young Benjamin Braddock, the son of her husband's law partner are mechanical but necessary props for her self-indulgent ego. Directed by Mike Nichols, with a melancholic soundtrack of songs by Simon and Garfunkel, ''The Graduate'' was hailed as a winning social satire. Bosley Crowther, writing in The New York Times, called it ''devastating and uproarious'' and hailed Ms. Bancroft's ''sullenly contemptuous and voracious performance.'' Mr. Nichols won an Oscar, while nominations went to Ms. Bancroft, Mr. Hoffman and Katharine Ross, who played Mrs. Robinson's daughter. The still photograph that appeared in advertisements for the film, showing Mrs. Robinson slowly peeling off a nylon stocking under the glazed gaze of Mr. Hoffman's Benjamin, became a classic of its kind.         Anna Maria Louisa Italiano was born on Sept. 17, 1931, in the Bronx to Italian immigrant parents. Her father, Michael, was a patternmaker, and her mother, Mildred, a telephone operator. By the time she was 2 years old she was learning to sing and dance. ''Why play with dolls,'' she recalled years later, ''when you can sing 'I Wish I Could Shimmy Like My Sister Kate' on the street corner?'' Even so, by the time she left high school she had decided to become a laboratory technician. Instead, her mother insisted that she attend the New York Academy of Dramatic Arts.         Two years later she found work in television where, as Anne Marno, she appeared in scores of dramatic shows. In 1951 she was asked to participate in another actor's screen test for 20th Century Fox, after which she, not he, was offered the contract that took her to Hollywood. At the studio she was handed a book of names and urged to choose a new one. She became Anne Bancroft. She had no illusions about that chapter of her film career, noting some years later that ''20th Century Fox told me what to do and I did it. I learned nothing.''         During her first stay in Hollywood she married Martin A. May, a building contractor, in 1954. They were divorced in 1957. In 1964 she married Mr. Brooks, who survives her, as does their son, Maximilian. Also surviving are her mother and two sisters, Joanne and Phyllis.         In the 1970's and 80's Ms. Bancroft took on a variety of roles, from Winston Churchill's American-born mother in ''Young Winston'' to the actress-wife of a hammy Polish impresario (''world famous in Poland''), played by Mr. Brooks, in the farcical ''To Be or Not to Be.'' She also earned two more Oscar nominations, one for her portrayal of a ballerina confronting her choice of career over family in ''The Turning Point,'' the other for her work as a mother superior in ''Agnes of God.'' Other major roles included '''Night Mother,'' as a woman struggling with her daughter's decision to commit suicide, and ''84 Charing Cross Road,'' in which she played an American writer whose correspondence with a London bookseller (Anthony Hopkins) develops into a long-distance romance.         She rarely returned to the theater, although she did win praise as the steel-willed Regina Giddens in Mr. Nichols's 1967 staging of Lillian Hellman's ''Little Foxes'' at Lincoln Center. In The Times, Clive Barnes characterized her performance as ''a series of unforgettable visual and aural images.'' The following year Ms. Bancroft appeared in the Lincoln Center Repertory production of another William Gibson drama, ''A Cry of Players,'' set in Shakespearean England. Her performance in ''Golda'' (1977) brought her a Tony nomination. She played a crippled violinist the 1981 ''Duet for One,'' which closed after a two-week run, and then was absent from the stage until the spring of 2002, when she was set to star in Edward Albee's ''Occupant'' as the sculptor Louise Nevelson. The play's scheduled run had to be canceled when Ms. Bancroft contracted pneumonia during previews.         In later years she continued to appear in films, although the roles grew smaller. She was briefly on screen as Nicolas Cage's mother in ''Honeymoon in Vegas,'' trained a young woman as an assassin in ''Point of No Return,'' scored a few points as a wily Senator in ''G.I. Jane'' and had some campy fun in an updated version of ''Great Expectations'' as a loony character based on Dickens's Miss Havisham.         She fared better in television, earning Emmy nominations playing a killer in the PBS drama ''Mrs. Cage'' and the title role in ''Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All'' on CBS.         She was resigned to the fact that age and changing times worked against her. In a 1992 interview in The Times she admitted to taking parts ''even if they're one page,'' because ''there are very few good scripts, even for Julia Roberts.'' She preferred a good bit part to a heftier bad one. She often rejected work in favor of family life -- for a while. ''I retire after every project,'' she once said. ''Then somehow there's always something that pulls me out of retirement.''         Correction:  June 18, 2005, Saturday  The obituary of the actress Anne Bancroft on June 8 misstated the name of the acting school she attended and omitted a major award. The school was the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, not the New York Academy. Ms. Bancroft won an Emmy in 1999 for best supporting actress in a mini-series, for the CBS drama ''Deep in My Heart.''       
         Audrey G. Hochberg, a former New York State assemblywoman, died yesterday morning at NewYork-Presbyterian/Columbia hospital in Manhattan. She was 71 and lived in Scarsdale.         The cause was uterine cancer, her daughter Judith Hochberg said.         A Democrat, Ms. Hochberg represented the 88th Assembly District, which includes Scarsdale, Eastchester, Pelham and parts of New Rochelle and White Plains. First elected in 1992, she retired in 2000 after four terms.         Ms. Hochberg, who held public office for nearly three decades, was noted for her work on environmental, civil-rights and gun-control issues. She began her political career as a member of the Westchester County Board of Legislators, only the second woman, and at the time one of the few Democrats, to win a seat there.         Audrey Elaine Golden was born in Stamford, Conn., on June 26, 1933, the daughter of Abraham H. Golden and the former Fannie Dodek. She earned a bachelor's degree in economics from Radcliffe in 1955 and married Herbert L. Hochberg the same year.         Ms. Hochberg first worked as a security analyst with Shields & Company, a brokerage house, but later set her career aside to raise three children. She became politically active during the Vietnam era, working in the antiwar movement and in Democratic Party politics. In 1971 she was elected to the Westchester County legislature, where she served for 21 years.         In the State Assembly, Ms. Hochberg, the chairwoman of the Legislative Commission on Solid Waste Management, sponsored bills aimed at improving the state's recycling programs.         Besides her husband and daughter, both of Scarsdale, Ms. Hochberg is survived by a sister, Merle Bogin, of Manhattan; another daughter, Brenda Hochberg, of Brookline, Mass.; and seven grandchildren. A third daughter, Carol, died in 1998.       
         Clare Lynch O'Brien, an author, editor and consultant to children's television, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 62.         The cause was breast cancer, her sister Eileen Lynch Sussan said.         Mrs. O'Brien was a senior children's editor at Random House and a longtime colleague of Fred Rogers, the children's television host. Together they wrote ''Mr. Rogers Talks With Families About Divorce.'' She was also a consultant for ''Big Blue Marble,'' a children's show on public television. She later worked as an interior designer.         Clare Lynch was born in Manhattan on April 23, 1943, and graduated from the State University of New York at Cortland in 1965. She married Richard F. O'Brien, an advertising executive, in 1973. They lived in Manhattan, Washington and Nantucket, Mass.         In addition to her husband and her sister Eileen, of Stamford, Conn., Mrs. O'Brien is survived by her daughter, Kate, of Nantucket; her son, Miles, of Cockeysville, Md.; her brothers Daniel Lynch of Richmond, Va., and Thomas Lynch, of Greenwich, Conn.; and three other sisters, Moira Crabtree of West Caldwell, N.J., Sheila Casey of Washington and Elizabeth Berman of Los Angeles.       
         Pamela May, a leading British dancer in the early years of the Royal Ballet who helped that company, then called Sadler's Wells Ballet, take New York by storm in 1949, died on Monday, the Royal Ballet announced in London. She was 88.         Although she was overshadowed in the troupe by her contemporary Margot Fonteyn, as other ballerinas of her generation were, Ms. May's free-spirited personality made her a public favorite in the 19th-century classics and roles created for her by Frederick Ashton and Ninette de Valois.         De Valois, the Royal Ballet's founder, recalled in her memoirs ''Come Dance With Me'' that ''Pamela May at the age of 14 was a beautifully made, graceful and talented handful.''         Born Doris May in San Fernando, Trinidad, on May 30, 1917, Ms. May entered de Valois's ballet school in London and made her debut in 1934 with the Vic-Wells Ballet, the precursor to the Sadler's Wells Ballet (the company was renamed the Royal Ballet in 1956). De Valois changed the young dancer's first name to Pamela and wrote that although initially in need of discipline, ''Pamela settled down -- first to a long and distinguished career in the company and then to pass her knowledge on to the younger Wells generation.''         Ms. May carved out a highly acclaimed reputation as a teacher at the Royal Ballet school from 1954 to 1977. She withdrew from ballerina roles in 1952 after recurring knee injuries but continued in mime and character roles at the Royal and as a guest artist elsewhere until her retirement from the stage in 1982.         A highly versatile dancer, she was known as a classical ballerina with a beautiful line and also as a dramatic dancer. The New York debut of Sadler's Wells in 1949 may have been a triumph for Fonteyn in ''The Sleeping Beauty,'' but Ms. May was one of the leading ballerinas who showed off the company's range. She appeared in, among other works, ''Checkmate,'' in which de Valois had choreographed the role of the gentle Red Queen for her.         Ms. May's leading roles included Odette/Odile in ''Swan Lake,'' Princess Aurora in ''The Sleeping Beauty,'' Myrtha in ''Giselle'' and a sparkling Swanilda in ''Coppélia.'' Ashton's major neo-Classical ballet ''Symphonic Variations'' (1946) featured her along with Fonteyn and Moira Shearer. Among other Ashton works in which she originated roles were ''Dante Sonata,'' ''Horoscope'' and ''The Wanderer,'' which featured a talked-about sensuous duet with Michael Somes.         Ms. May's first husband, Painton Cowan, died in World War II. She later married Charles Gordon. She is survived by a son and a daughter.       
         Lillian Lux, the matriarch of a celebrated Yiddish theatrical family who performed for decades as an actress and singer in New York and around the world, died on Saturday at St. Vincent's Hospital in Manhattan. She was 86 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her son, Mike Burstyn, said.         With her husband, Pesach Burstein, Ms. Lux starred inYiddish-language plays and musicals from the 1930's on. Among her most famous roles was Feygele in the operetta ''A Khasene in Shtetl'' (''A Village Wedding''), which she played opposite her husband. In later years, the couple performed with their two children as the Four Bursteins.         The family was the subject of a documentary, ''The Komediant,'' shown in the United States in 2002. Directed by Arnon Goldfinger, an Israeli filmmaker, the film is narrated by Ms. Lux.         The first decades of the 20th century were the glory days of the Yiddish stage, with more than a dozen theaters in New York City alone. To their devoted fans, who packed the seats for original productions and adaptations of the classics, Ms. Lux and Mr. Burstein were the Lunt and Fontanne of the Lower East Side.         In the late 1940's Ms. Lux had her own Yiddish-language radio show on WEVD-AM. But by the 1950's, with theatergoers graying and many American Jews assimilating, Yiddish theater began to disappear. By the 1970's, it was almost completely gone. ''The Komediant'' chronicles the family's peripatetic existence as they travel to Europe, South America and Israel in pursuit of an ever more elusive audience.         Lillian Sylvia Lukashefsky was born in Brooklyn on June 20, 1918; her family Americanized its surname when she was young. She began her stage training as a child with the Yiddish Art Theater, run by the impresario Maurice Schwartz. As a teenager, she played the Catskills, performing opposite Danny Kaye.         At 17 Ms. Lux met Mr. Burstein, more than 20 years her senior and an established star. He was looking for an actress for his South American tour. After making the requisite good impression on Ms. Lux's parents, he hired her. They set sail and were married in Uruguay in 1938.         In the late 1930's, the couple toured Poland, catching the last ship out before the Nazis invaded in September 1939. After the war, they returned to Europe. Little of their audience remained. In the 1950's, the Bursteins went to Israel but found it difficult for Yiddish theater to take root there. They had better success a decade later, when they returned with ''The Megilla of Itzik Manger.'' The show, a musical version of the Book of Esther starring Ms. Lux, her husband and son, came to Broadway in a Yiddish-English production in 1968.         After her husband's death in 1986, Ms. Lux performed in a one-woman show and appeared often on radio.         Besides her son, of Los Angeles (an actor on Broadway and in films, Mr. Burstyn changed the spelling of his name as an adult), Ms. Lux is survived by a daughter, Susan Roth of Westfield, N.J.; and a sister, Beatrice Friedman of Washington.       
         Jane Benedict, a prominent housing advocate who was the principal founder of the Metropolitan Council on Housing, a New York City tenants' rights organization, died on Saturday in Berkeley, Calif. She was 93. A longtime resident of New York, she had lived in Oakland, Calif., for the last several years.         The cause was pneumonia, said her son, Jim Hawley.         A former trade unionist, Ms. Benedict was active in housing issues for four decades. She helped found the Metropolitan Council in 1958 and was its chairwoman for many years. Among issues concerning the council are rent regulation, protection from unlawful eviction and creating affordable public housing.         Jane Wiley Benedict was born in Manhattan on Nov. 10, 1911. She attended Connecticut College for Women for two years before transferring to Cornell, where she received a bachelor's degree in English in 1933. After graduating, she returned to New York City, going to work in the book department of Macy's.         Through her job, Ms. Benedict became involved in the Book and Magazine Guild, a trade union. She was later an organizer for the union's parent, the United Office and Professional Workers of America.         Ms. Benedict became involved with housing in the early 1950's when she lived in the Yorkville section of Manhattan. In those years, many of the neighborhood's prewar tenements were being razed for luxury high-rise apartment buildings, displacing tens of thousands of low-and middle-income residents.         In response, Ms. Benedict started the Yorkville Save Our Homes Committee, which lobbied for the construction of low-cost, racially integrated public housing. The committee later joined forces with other New York tenants' groups to form the Metropolitan Council, a citywide organization.         In 1982 Ms. Benedict ran for governor as a member of the Unity Party, a coalition of community, labor and tenants' groups.         Ms. Benedict's first marriage ended in divorce. Her second husband, Peter Hawley, a union organizer whom she married in 1942, died in 1996. Besides her son, of Oakland, Ms. Benedict is survived by a daughter, Ellen Hawley, of Minneapolis; two grandchildren; and a great-grandchild.       
         Nan Kempner, one of New York's most serene hostesses and clotheshorses, a glittering fixture at social events and fashion shows on both sides of the Atlantic for decades, died Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 74.         The cause was emphysema, said her husband, Thomas. A heavy smoker until about 10 years ago, she had been breathing with the aid of an oxygen tank.         As slim as a stalk of celery and, as she proudly acknowledged, ''possibly one of the first people to have plastic surgery,'' Mrs. Kempner was a member of fashion's Hall of Fame and a Park Avenue hostess whose table was considered one of the best in Manhattan.         An original ''social X-ray,'' the phrase coined by Tom Wolfe to describe the premier rich and thin socialites of the Upper East Side, she never hesitated to admit that she loved making an entrance, loved being noticed and loved being photographed. She was a tireless and in-demand guest at every A-list function she could squeeze into a schedule that included trips each year to London, Paris, Gstaad, Venice, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Vail and Nassau for couture shows, parties, skiing and sunning.         Mrs. Kempner was known for her self-deprecating sense of humor and for being one of the few women slender enough to look, and feel, comfortable on the ubiquitous narrow gilt chairs of the couture salons. But she never considered comfort a major factor. She was simply ''crazy'' about clothes, cheerfully describing herself as an insatiable shopper who spent ''more than I should, and less than I want.''         ''The best part of a party is getting dressed to go,'' she often said. When her children left the nest, she turned their rooms into walk-in closets.         She was born Nan Field Schlesinger in San Francisco on July 24, 1930. Her father, Albert Schlesinger, known as Speed, owned one of California's largest Ford dealerships, and her mother, Irma, was a woman her daughter called ''an extraordinary fashion plate, who cared terribly about how she looked and who started me in couture as a child.''         After graduating from the Hamlin School in San Francisco, Mrs. Kempner entered Connecticut College for Women, but left before graduation. During a junior year abroad, she studied at the Sorbonne and had what she called ''painting lessons'' with Fernand Léger.         ''He said I was a disgrace, that I had so little talent I should go back to San Francisco and stop wasting my parents' money,'' she recalled. ''It wasn't exactly endearing, but it was true.''         After working briefly as a volunteer at the San Francisco Museum of Art, she was married in 1952 to Thomas L. Kempner, chairman of Loeb Partners, the investment banking house, and a grandson of Carl M. Loeb, the founder and former head of the firm. In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sons, Thomas Kempner Jr. of Manhattan and James L. Kempner of Greenwich, Conn.; a daughter, Adeline Field Kempner of Manhattan; and six grandchildren.         Mrs. Kempner entertained in a duplex apartment whose rooms were lined with antique silk panels or hand-painted French wallpaper with a lush, intertwining floral design. There were two paintings by René Magritte, a couple of bronze bas-reliefs by Robert Graham and tables piled high with art books and ancient Chinese bric-a-brac. The apartment also housed a small gym, where Mrs. Kempner exercised relentlessly, keeping herself thin enough to slip into the mannequins' dresses -- garments worn once by models on runways -- that she bought at a discount in Paris, Milan and New York.         Although she bought clothes from many leading couturiers, she was said to own thousands of Yves Saint Laurent creations and told The Independent of London in a 1994 interview that she had missed only one of his last 63 shows. She relished the flights of imagination that a well-chosen outfit allowed.         ''I remember in the 70's,'' she told The Independent, ''our car would drop the kids off at school, then Tommy would pick me up, and he'd say, 'Now, who are we today?' and I'd be Pocahontas, Nanook of the North, I'd be -- God knows -- the River Boat Queen. It was such fun.''         In addition to buying, wearing and collecting clothes, many of which she donated to museums' costume institutes and various charities, Mrs. Kempner served on a number of charitable boards and benefit committees, gave occasional courses in couture at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and at New York University, and flirted with a number of other careers. In the 1960's, she was a special editor of Harper's Bazaar magazine; in the early 70's, she was a design consultant for Tiffany & Company; and in the 1980's, she was a correspondent for French Vogue.         In the late 90's, she became an international representative for Christie's, a job she defined as ''a shill to bring friends in.'' Her book of recipes and happenings, ''R.S.V.P.: Menus for Entertaining From People Who Really Know How,'' was published by Clarkson Potter in 2000, with the proceeds going to the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center.         In a 1999 article in Town & Country, Annette Tapert asked Mrs. Kempner how she would describe her look. ''Artificially relaxed,'' she responded. ''It takes a lot of work to look relaxed. I've always liked being noticed, and I work hard at it. I'll never forget one day when my son Jamie and I were walking down the street and he asked, 'Mummy, do you mind if I walk on the other side of the street?' And I said, 'Why?' and he said, 'Because people stare!' But frankly, I couldn't go mail a letter if I didn't feel I looked all right.''         Then again, she once said: ''I tell people all the time I want to be buried naked. I know there will be a store where I'm going.''       
         Geraldine Fitzgerald, a feisty, gravel-voiced Dublin redhead who drew instant acclaim in her first Hollywood films, including a 1939 Oscar nomination for ''Wuthering Heights,'' before carving out a long, varied career in films, television, cabaret and theater, died on Sunday afternoon at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 91.         She had Alzheimer's disease for more than a decade and was essentially incapacitated in recent years, leading to a respiratory infection that finally killed her, said her daughter, Susan Scheftel, a clinical psychologist in New York.         Ms. Fitzgerald appeared on the New York stage and as a highly coveted character actress in dozens of Hollywood films, including ''Watch on the Rhine'' in 1943, ''Ten North Frederick'' in 1958, ''The Pawnbroker'' in 1964, ''Harry and Tonto'' in 1974 and ''Arthur'' in 1981. But she may have been best known in New York for what many critics considered one of the definitive Mary Tyrones, opposite Robert Ryan, in a 1971 revival of Eugene O'Neill's ''Long Day's Journey Into Night.''         Witty and intelligent, she was also notoriously combative and blamed herself for sabotaging her early Hollywood success by battling with studio executives over roles. ''My mother was just way too feisty to be in bondage to the Warner Brothers,'' Ms. Scheftel said.         Born in 1913, the daughter of a Dublin solicitor, Geraldine Fitzgerald was drawn into the legendary Gate Theater by her aunt, Shelagh Richards, one of its stars. Ms. Fitzgerald performed there alongside James Mason and Orson Welles. She married Edward Lindsay-Hogg, an Irish aristocrat, and after a stint at art school in England she moved to New York in 1938 to further her husband's songwriting ambitions.         Money grew tight, and she noted that her old friend Welles was directing something called the Mercury Theater. She called and he hired her for a role in ''Heartbreak House.''         Norman Lloyd, a longtime friend and founding member of the Mercury Theater, described the effect she had. ''She was a staggeringly beautiful girl with the most delightful speech, a slight Irish tinge, not a thick brogue, and this glorious red hair,'' he said.         Hal Wallis, a major Hollywood producer, saw her in Shaw's ''Heartbreak House'' and signed her to a Warner Brothers contract. She was told to play best friend to the dying Bette Davis in ''Dark Victory'' (1939), and her performance persuaded Samuel Goldwyn to cast her as the tragic Isabella Linton in ''Wuthering Heights.''         In the 1940's she mingled with Hollywood's intellectual elite, counting among her friends Laurence Olivier, Charlie Chaplin, Davis, Welles and the screenwriter Charles Lederer.         When World War II separated Ms. Fitzgerald from her husband, then back in England, she stayed in Los Angeles with their son, Michael Lindsay-Hogg, later to become an acclaimed film, television and Broadway director. Her first marriage ended in 1946.         By then, she had worked her way up to leading roles. A performance as Woodrow Wilson's wife, Edith, in ''Wilson'' (1944) earned her a glamorous photo on the cover of Life magazine. It also attracted the attention of Stuart Scheftel, the grandson of Isador Straus, the co-owner of the R.H. Macy Co. who went down with the Titanic. Scheftel asked a friend to introduce them, and they were married in 1946.         They moved to New York and joined the rarefied circles in which the city's cultural and political worlds mingled. The couple stayed together until his death in 1994.         She continued to work steadily and in the 1960's formed the Everyman Street Theater, which ventured into the city's poorest neighborhoods to recruit and train street performers. This led to an interest in directing, and she staged several productions, including all-black productions of O'Neill classics. In 1982, she received her only Tony nomination, as a director, for ''Mass Appeal.'' Among the directors she aced out of a nomination that year was her son, who staged ''Agnes of God'' a couple of blocks away. He survives her, along with Ms. Scheftel, two grandchildren and one step-grandchild.         In the 1970's, after a small role in ''Rachel, Rachel'' required her to sing on camera, the unpleasant results caused her to take voice lessons. Thus she began yet another career, as a cabaret artist. Her show ''Streetsongs'' was a nightclub hit and appeared three times in Broadway theaters over the years.         When young actresses went to her for advice, she remembered her own regrets about having looked down her nose at early Hollywood offers. ''Her advice to young actresses was to always say yes,'' Ms. Scheftel said. ''She had learned that the hard way by saying no all the time. So she would tell them, when offered work, always say yes.''         Correction:  July 27, 2005, Wednesday  An obituary of the actress Geraldine Fitzgerald on July 19 misspelled the given name of the Macy's co-owner whose grandson she married. He was Isidor Straus, not Isador.       
         Elizabeth Blodgett Hall, an educator who concluded that bored high school students should be sent straight to college and started Simon's Rock College to prove the point, died on Monday in Canaan, Conn. She was 95.         Her death was announced by Judith Monachina, spokeswoman for the college, in Great Barrington, Mass., which is now part of Bard College. Mrs. Hall, as the headmistress of a girls' prep school, perceived that adolescents were maturing faster than in the past, and that high schools were not meeting the challenge. So in 1964, she began what she called ''an early college'' for young women. Students who otherwise would have been in the last two years of high school instead took the first two years of college.         Leon Botstein, president of Bard, explained in an interview that Mrs. Hall abhorred the way adolescents were ''infantilized,'' when they were capable of doing high-level academic work. He said that her ideas had been adopted by more and more colleges, and that Bard itself had intensified its ''early-college'' efforts by beginning a high school in New York City in 2001 to teach college-level courses.         The later Bard program received funds from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which has also given millions to other early college programs on the theory they will help reduce dropout rates. Tom Vander Ark, executive director of the foundation's education program, credited Mrs. Hall's inspiration.         Mrs. Hall's mission was intensely personal. In addition to spending more than $6 million of her own, she gave 200 acres of her family's farmland, buildings included, to start the college, which became coeducational in 1970. She named it for a rock on which she had played as a child.         Elizabeth Blodgett was born in Manhattan on Nov. 16, 1909. Her father made a fortune in the chewing gum industry.         She later attended public and private schools in the Great Barrington area. She graduated from Miss Hall's School in Pittsfield, Mass., in 1928, and then attended Knox College for a year.         In 1930, she married Livingston Hall, who was later a professor and administrator at Harvard Law School. After having four children, she entered Radcliffe College, one of the first adults to do so, and graduated in 1946.         After holding several other jobs, she became head of the history department, then headmistress, at the Concord Academy, a private girls' school in Concord, Mass. An article in Mademoiselle in 1969 said she turned ''a genteel finishing school'' into ''one of the most dynamic girls' preparatory schools in the East.''         It was a time when educators were scrambling to jump-start education to keep up with the Russians, in space and elsewhere. Initiatives ranged from Advanced Placement courses that allowed students to do college-credit work while still in high school to the experimental admissions of bright high school students.         Earlier, in the 1930's, Robert Maynard Hutchins, president of the University of Chicago and a philosopher of education, had admitted academically superior 16-year-olds as freshmen. European universities had long allowed such acceleration.         What Mrs. Hall was doing was different in that she established a residential college expressly for high school aged students, putting it somewhere between a prep school and a college, with resultant tensions. For example, students complained about rules forbidding overnight room visits by members of the opposite sex.         There have been accusations over the years between the students and the administration as the college sought to find ways to restrict students' behavior without being harsh.         Mrs. Hall faced frequent criticism from both faculty and students. In an interview with Berkshire Week in 1988, she recalled that she fought against ''self-pity'' before resigning, partly as a result of such criticism, in 1972 . She remained a trustee.         Mrs. Hall's husband died in 1995. She is survived by her sons, Thomas Livingston Hall of San Francisco, and John Kendrick Hall of Jerusalem; her daughters, Margaret Hall Whitfield Courant of Great Barrington and Elizabeth Hall Richardson of Denver; 11 grandchildren; and nine great-grandchildren.         Correction:  July 21, 2005, Thursday  An obituary yesterday about Elizabeth Blodgett Hall, who founded Simon's Rock College, now part of Bard College, referred incorrectly in some copies to the given name of the president of Bard, who commented on her legacy. He is Leon Botstein, not Leo.       
         Mary T. Washington, a bookkeeper who in the 1920's began methodically surmounting racial barriers in business to become the first African-American woman to be a certified public accountant and the head of one of the largest black-owned accounting firms in the nation, died on July 2 at a nursing home in Chicago. She was 99.         Her death was reported by her daughter, Barbara Shepherd.         Ms. Washington began her career after high school in the 1920's at Binga State Bank, one of the nation's largest black-owned banks.         She worked at the bank as an assistant to the cashier and vice president, Arthur Wilson.         When virtually no white C.P.A.'s would hire blacks, Mr. Wilson provided Ms. Washington with the requisite experience, according to an account written by Theresa A. Hammond, who is the chairman of the accounting department at the Carroll School of Management at Boston College.         In 2002, Dr. Hammond published a book on the history of black C.P.A.'s, ''A White-Collar Profession: African-American Certified Public Accountants Since 1921,'' which included Ms. Washington's career and influence.         Inspired by Mr. Wilson, Ms. Washington earned her bachelor's degree in business from Northwestern University in 1941. While a student, she opened her own accounting firm in her basement, recruiting black businesses as clients.         Her husband, Donald Melvin Wylie, a mechanic for Yellow Cab, would cook late-night dinners for the group of ambitious young black men who worked for her during the tax season.         Her first business partner, Hiram Pittman, once described it as an ''Underground Railroad'' for aspiring black C.P.A.'s, who came from across the country to work there because they needed the experience to earn the accounting credential.         A study by the National Association of Black Accountants found that in 1943 Ms. Washington became the first black woman to become a C.P.A. and the 13th black C.P.A. in the country, Dr. Hammond said.         With Mr. Pittman and Lester McKeever, she founded Washington, Pittman & McKeever in 1968, still one of the largest black C.P.A. firms. She retired from the firm in 1985 at age 79.         Mary Thelma Morrison was born in Vicksburg, Miss., on April 21, 1906, to Daisy and William Morrison, a carpenter, who boasted to friends that his young daughter could read the entire newspaper.         When she was 6, her mother died, and she went to Chicago to live with her maternal grandparents. She attended Wendell Phillips High School, where she excelled in math.         Her first marriage, to Seymour Washington, ended in divorce.         Besides Ms. Shepherd, Ms. Washington is survived by two sons, Donald Wylie Jr. of Chicago and Donald Wylie II of Los Angeles; two other daughters, Melanie Blanks of Chicago and Ardelia Smith of Chicago; and nine grandchildren.       
         Barbara Bel Geddes, a critically acclaimed stage, screen and television actress known for her work with Alfred Hitchcock in the 1950's and, more recently, for her role as Miss Ellie, the matriarch of the fractious Ewing clan on the long-running nighttime soap opera ''Dallas,'' died on Monday at her home in Northeast Harbor, Me. She was 82.         The Jordan-Fernald Funeral Home in Mount Desert, Me., confirmed the death to The Associated Press, giving no cause. The San Francisco Chronicle reported yesterday that Ms. Bel Geddes had died of lung cancer.         On Broadway Ms. Bel Geddes was best known as the original Maggie the Cat in Tennessee Williams's ''Cat on Hot Tin Roof,'' which opened in 1955. She also appeared in ''The Moon Is Blue'' (1951) and ''Silent Night, Lonely Night'' (1959). Her film credits include Hitchcock's ''Vertigo'' (1958); ''Caught'' (1949), directed by Max Ophüls; and ''Panic in the Streets'' (1950), directed by Elia Kazan.         On television Ms. Bel Geddes starred in several episodes of Hitchcock's weekly series ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents'' during the late 1950's and early 1960's. In 1980 she won the Emmy Award for best actress in a dramatic series for her role on ''Dallas.''         Blond, soft-spoken and slightly plump as a young woman, Ms. Bel Geddes projected a resolute, even steely, intelligence beneath her cherubic exterior. It was a quality Hitchcock used to great effect, notably in ''Vertigo,'' in which Ms. Bel Geddes played Midge, the steadfast, unglamorous ex-fiancée of Jimmy Stewart, who watches his painful descent into obsession and madness.         Hitchcock used her memorably again in ''Lamb to the Slaughter,'' widely considered one of the finest episodes of ''Alfred Hitchcock Presents.'' Broadcast in the spring of 1958, it starred Ms. Bel Geddes as a wife who murders her philandering husband by bludgeoning him with a frozen leg of lamb. When detectives show up to investigate the death, the murder weapon is nowhere to be found. Ms. Bel Geddes, smiling a tiny, knowing smile, sits them down to a home-cooked meal.         Barbara Bel Geddes was born in New York on Oct. 31, 1922. Her father was Norman Bel Geddes, the architect and stage designer. She made her Broadway debut in 1941 in the forgettable play ''Out of the Frying Pan.'' She went on to win a Theater World Award in 1946 for her performance in ''Deep Are the Roots,'' which Kazan directed.         Soon afterward, Ms. Bel Geddes went to Hollywood, where she starred opposite Henry Fonda in her first film, ''The Long Night'' (1947). Although she was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance as Katrin Hanson, the daughter of Norwegian immigrants in ''I Remember Mama'' (1948), Ms. Bel Geddes made relatively few movies, working primarily in theater and television. Her other film credits include ''Blood on the Moon'' (1948), ''Fourteen Hours'' (1951) and ''The Five Pennies'' (1959).         Ms. Bel Geddes's greatest critical acclaim came as Maggie, the restless young wife in a decaying family of Mississippi planters in ''Cat on a Hot Tin Roof.'' Reviewing her performance in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson called it ''vital, lovely and frank.''         Her other Broadway credits include ''The Living Room'' (1954), by Graham Greene; ''The Sleeping Prince'' (1956), by Terence Rattigan; and ''Mary, Mary'' (1961), by Jean Kerr.         Ms. Bel Geddes appeared on ''Dallas'' in two installments, the first from 1978 to 1984, when she retired after heart surgery. She was replaced as Miss Ellie by Donna Reed, who sued to retain the role after the show's producers reinstated Ms. Bel Geddes in 1985. Ms. Reed lost her bid, and Ms. Bel Geddes remained in the role until 2000.         Ms. Bel Geddes's first marriage, to Carl Schreuer, an engineer, ended in divorce. Her second husband, Windsor Lewis, a theater director, died before her. She is survived by a daughter, Susan, from her first marriage, and a daughter, Betsy, from her second.         In addition to acting, Ms. Bel Geddes also worked as a professional artist. She wrote and illustrated two children's books, ''I Like to Be Me'' (Viking, 1963) and ''So Do I'' (Arbor House, 1972).         Looking back on her career, Ms. Bel Geddes expressed amusement that she was so often cast as patricians. ''They're always making me play well-bred ladies,'' she told People magazine in 1982. She added, ''I'm not very well bred, and I'm not much of a lady.''         Correction:  August 13, 2005, Saturday  An obituary of the actress Barbara Bel Geddes on Thursday misstated the year of her final appearance on the television show ''Dallas.'' It was 1990, not 2000. A picture caption referred incorrectly to the character she played. It was Miss Ellie, not Ms. Ellie.       
         Judith Rossner, a novelist who used crisp, piercing prose to tell of women pushed to often grotesque extremes, most famously in her 1975 book ''Looking for Mr. Goodbar,'' died on Tuesday at New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 70.         The cause was not immediately determined, Rayner Pike, her brother-in-law, told The Associated Press.         Ms. Rossner marshaled intriguing plot twists, precise description and deep empathy to examine women's experiences, addressing situations like pregnancy, sex with strangers and the introduction of a man into a single-parent household.         ''Many of her novels offer a clinical dissection of America's failed marriages and of a culture that has not permitted women to have a life apart from their children and husband,'' said the reference book Contemporary Novelists.         ''Mr. Goodbar,'' the fourth of Ms. Rossner's 10 novels, sold four million copies and in 1977 became a popular movie starring Diane Keaton. The book was based loosely on the 1973 murder of a young schoolteacher in New York who frequented singles bars and could be read as a particularly harrowing caution for the sexually adventurous.         Her seventh novel, ''August,'' published in 1983, was also a best seller. It is about of the complex relationship between a troubled teenager and her psychiatrist, with much of the story told in what seem like transcripts of analytic sessions.         Ms. Rossner's vivid imagination is suggested by the circumstances of the young analysand: Dawn Henley was raised by a lesbian aunt and her lover after Dawn's mother killed herself and her homosexual father drowned in a boating accident. Her foster parents have since separated.         Other fanciful plots include a woman who falls in love with a young man who turns out to be her illegitimate son in ''Emmeline'' (1980), and conjoined twins who marry two women in ''Attachments'' (1977), with the curiosity-inspiring sexual gymnastics hardly ignored.         John Leonard in The New York Times called ''Attachments'' an ''ambitious, disturbing novel by a best-selling author who might have written a trashy book, but decided instead to mess up our minds.''         Judith Perelman was born in Manhattan on March 31, 1935, and grew up in the Bronx. Her father was a textile merchant and her mother a schoolteacher who nurtured her daughter's early interest in writing. At 19 she dropped out of the City College of New York to marry Robert Rossner, a teacher and writer whose name she kept after their divorce in 1972.         She later married and divorced Mordecai Persky. She is survived by her husband Stanley Leff; her children, Daniel and Jean Rossner; her sister, Nancy Pike; and three grandchildren.         Her first marriage broke up after an ill-fated move to a New Hampshire commune, and she returned to New York, where she supported her family with secretarial work, carving out time to write her first three novels. These included ''Any Minute I Can Split,'' finished just before her first divorce.         ''My abiding theme is separations,'' she said in an interview with The Washington Post in 1983.         Ms. Rossner became fascinated by the murder of Roseann Quinn, the 27-year-old schoolteacher killed after an encounter in a singles bar, and proposed an article for a special women's issue of Esquire magazine. Esquire's lawyers, fearing the article might jeopardize the accused man's defense, killed the story.         Ms. Rossner, who was recovering from a car accident, found herself pondering the extent to which people are to blame for their own misfortunes. She wrote a one-sentence proposal for a novel on the episode to Simon & Schuster. It read: ''I want to write a book about a schoolteacher who's murdered picking up someone when she's cruising a singles bar.''         According to some published reports, she received a $5,000 advance; others say $10,000. ''Mr. Goodbar'' was sold for $300,000 as a paperback and for $250,000 as a movie, making her financially independent.         Christopher Hawtree, writing in The Guardian of London in 1990, described the book's bleak theme: ''Some of the raunchiest sex scenes ever written lead to a despair that makes death almost inevitable, perhaps even sought.''         Ms. Rossner's other books included ''To the Precipice'' (1966), ''Nine Months in the Life of an Old Maid'' (1969), ''His Little Women'' (1990), ''Olivia'' (1994) and ''Perfidia'' (1997).         Her works repeatedly explored but never explained what she considered an unsettling quandary.         ''It's astonishing what some women will put up with just to have a warm body -- some of the brightest women I know are obsessed with that search,'' she told The Washington Post. ''It's very sad.''       
         Mary Ann Malkin, a noted rare-book collector and editor who for nearly two decades helped run AB Bookman's Weekly, the well-thumbed bible of the rare- and secondhand-book business that inflamed and then often sated the acquisitive passions of book collectors around the world, died on Aug. 1 at her home in Manhattan. She was 92.         Mrs. Malkin apparently died in her sleep, said Eric Holzenberg, the director of the Grolier Club of New York, the bibliophilic organization, which announced the death.         Mrs. Malkin, who signed her many book reviews in the magazine with just her initials, was known to generations of rare-book dealers and collectors simply as Mam.         With her husband, Solomon, she ran AB, as it was fondly known in the trade, from 1953 to 1972. (The initials stood for Antiquarian Bookman, the journal's original title.) In later years, Mrs. Malkin became an internationally recognized rare-book collector, amassing a library of historical books on dance notation that is considered the finest in the world.         In the decades after World War II, the mail-order secondhand-book trade was a flourishing enterprise, and AB, founded in 1948, was its chief avenue of communication. Eagerly awaited, greedily pored over and tenderly dog-eared, the journal was almost certainly the only bound artifact that any of its 10,000 subscribers -- rare-book dealers, librarians and private collectors -- would have ever considered marking up.         For 19 years, the Malkins ran the magazine from an office in downtown Newark where every horizontal surface, and many not-quite-horizontal ones, boiled over with centuries of books, papers and pamphlets. Sol. Malkin, who with the typographic exactitude of a cataloguer always spelled his nickname with a period, was AB's owner, editor and publisher. Mrs. Malkin was the administrative assistant, copy editor, proofreader, book critic and maker of coffee, which, for Mr. Malkin, had to be several parts cognac.         Thick, digest-sized and printed on very cheap paper, AB offered trade news, gossip and articles about book collecting. But it was for the classified ads that the journal was prized. Through its Books Wanted and Books for Sale departments, AB united far-flung collectors with dealers around the world, any one of whom just might happen to have a long-sought title in stock. (''Wanted: Any books on horse named Cruiser by Rary, Brown or others, ca. 1870?'' a listing in the issue of Jan. 3, 1953, read.)         Some of the ads catered to highbrow tastes. In December 1953, a dealer in Milwaukee offered an early edition of Gertrude Stein's 1925 novel, ''The Making of Americans,'' signed by Alice B. Toklas, for $12.50.         Others spoke of baser needs. ''Wanted: Spicy pulps of the 30's. Pep, Ginger, Paris Nights, Spicy Detective, Tattle Tales, etc.,'' a 1965 ad read.         Still others were simply bewildering, like this one, from March 22, 1965: ''Wanted: Anything on 'raining' of unusual objects -- frogs, toads, fish, beads, etc. -- falling or 'raining' from the sky.''         Mary Ann O'Brian was born on March 13, 1913, in Altoona, Pa. She earned an undergraduate degree from Pennsylvania State University in 1937, married a professor and moved with him to New York. The marriage ended in divorce, and she took a secretarial job with R.R. Bowker, then the parent company of Publishers Weekly, the book-industry trade magazine.         In 1948, Bowker started publishing Antiquarian Bookman, which had begun as a column in Publishers Weekly, as a stand-alone magazine, with Mr. Malkin as editor. The Malkins married around this time. Mr. Malkin bought Antiquarian Bookman in 1953, changing its name in 1967.         Mr. Malkin, who sold AB in 1972, died in 1986. Faced with rising competition from online used-book sellers, the magazine ceased publication in 1999. Today the Web site abbookman.com, owned by Intergalactic Inc., an Arizona used-bookstore chain that bought the rights to the name, offers information for dealers and collectors but does not sell books directly.         Mrs. Malkin leaves no immediate survivors. Her collection of dance books is now housed at Penn State. The university is also the distributor of a book she wrote with several colleagues, ''Dancing by the Book: A Catalogue of Books, 1531-1804, in the Collection of Mary Ann O'Brian Malkin.'' Published privately in 2003, the book can be obtained in very clean copies, with hard covers (no dust jacket) and many handsome illustrations.       
         Joyce Wein, a former vice president of the company that produced the Newport Jazz and Folk Festivals and numerous other events, died on Monday at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital on the Upper East Side. She was 76 and lived on the Upper East Side.         The cause was cancer, said a spokeswoman for the company, Festival Productions, which was founded by her husband, George Wein         Mrs. Wein was a biochemist but became professionally involved in music through her marriage in 1959 to Mr. Wein, the founder of the Newport festivals and the chief executive of Festival Productions. Mrs. Wein was a vice president of the company from shortly after it was established in the early 1960's to the late 1990's, and remained involved in its operations until her death.         Besides the Newport events, Festival Productions presents the New Orleans Jazz and Heritage Festival, the JVC Jazz Festival in New York and many other events worldwide. Mrs. Wein had a hand in all of them but had especially close ties with the folk festival, which her husband founded in 1959. For several years beginning in 1963, the festival was run by the nonprofit Newport Folk Foundation, which Mr. and Mrs. Wein established with the folk singer Pete Seeger and his wife, Toshi.         Joyce Alexander was born in Boston on Oct. 21, 1928, and majored in chemistry at Simmons College there. She was the jazz columnist for the Simmons student newspaper and Mr. Wein was an aspiring jazz pianist when they met at a jazz concert in Boston in 1947.         Mrs. Wein was a founder of the New York Coalition of 100 Black Women, a charitable organization, and established the Joyce and George Wein Professorship Fund in African-American Studies at Boston University and the Alexander Family Endowed Scholarship Fund at Simmons.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sisters, Eugenia Manning of San Francisco and Theodora McLaurin of Hingham, Mass.         Correction:  August 19, 2005, Friday  An obituary yesterday about Joyce Wein, who worked on music festivals and charities with her husband, George, misstated the name of one of her projects. It is the George and Joyce Wein Chair in African-American Studies at Boston University, not the George and Joyce Wein Professorship Fund.       
         Mo Mowlam, the earthy, straight-talking politician who as Britain's Northern Ireland secretary helped negotiate the Good Friday peace settlement in 1998, died Friday morning at a hospice in Canterbury, her family said. She was 55.         Unsteady on her feet at times as a result of radiotherapy treatments for a brain tumor discovered in 1997, Ms. Mowlam fell and hit her head two weeks ago, slipping into a coma from which she never recovered. She left instructions that she not be kept alive artificially if there was no hope of improvement, her family said, and doctors removed her artificial feeding tube earlier this week.         Ms. Mowlam, who retired from politics four years ago, was an unusually blunt and unusually popular member of Parliament. After the radiation treatments caused her hair to fall out, she regularly flung her wig off during negotiations and news conferences, complaining that it made her head itch.         ''I hate the bloody things and have to carry two around with me because I kept losing one,'' she once said.         During the 1998 Labor Party conference, Prime Minister Tony Blair referred to her as ''our Mo'' in passing during his keynote speech, only to have the audience unexpectedly give her a prolonged standing ovation. Although the prime minister joked about it, she later said she thought that he resented being upstaged and felt threatened by her popularity.         In any case, the two fell out politically. He removed her from her Northern Ireland post against her will in 1999, shuffling her to a less important job in the Cabinet Office, and she eventually quit politics, growing increasingly disillusioned with his New Labor government.         But as tributes poured in from across the political spectrum on Friday, the prime minister called Ms. Mowlam ''one of the shrewdest political minds I ever encountered'' and said she was ''great company, utterly irreverent, full of life and fun.''         ''It is no exaggeration to say she transformed the politics not just of Northern Ireland itself but crucially of relations between the Republic of Ireland and the United Kingdom,'' he said, ''and it was this transformation that created the culture in which peacemaking could flourish.''         Marjorie Mowlam was born in 1949 and brought up in Coventry. She had a tough childhood -- her family was invariably short of money, and her father was an alcoholic. She came to politics late, at the age of 38, after working as a college lecturer.         She decided to run for Parliament just five days before the deadline to register as a candidate for the 1987 election and won a seat in Redcar, on the North Sea coast. Immensely charismatic, bawdy, unpretentious and funny, she became an integral part of Mr. Blair's rejuvenated Labor Party, helping lead it into power in the 1997 general election.         She was quickly made Northern Ireland secretary, with a mission to help effect a peace settlement for the warring province. She visited paramilitary prisoners at Maze Prison to win them over to the idea of peace.         But even as she worked hard to build good relations with Sinn Fein, the political arm of the Irish Republican Army, which wants Northern Ireland to become part of the Irish Republic, she alienated unionists, who want it to remain united with Britain and who accused her of being too sympathetic to the republican cause.         She complained that she was increasingly marginalized during the talks that eventually led to the peace agreement, saying she was no more than ''a tea lady.'' After she was removed from the Northern Ireland post, her criticism of the government grew louder. When she finally left politics, she said it had become ''harder and harder to defend what the Labor government is doing.''         In 2002 she published a memoir, ''Momentum,'' in which, among other things, she stated that Mr. Blair and Gordon Brown, the chancellor of the Exchequer, were not getting along.         She is survived by her husband, Jon Norton, and two stepchildren.         Her plain-spokenness extended to shouting and swearing at intransigent politicians from both sides in Northern Ireland, invariably men, and invariably tough combatants. She was once overhead saying to Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, ''Bloody well get on and do it; otherwise I'll head-butt you!''       
         Jane Lawrence Smith, an actress and singer and the widow of the architect and sculptor Tony Smith, died on Aug. 5 at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 90.         Her death was announced by her family.         Ms. Smith was one of the last survivors of the central circle of Abstract Expressionist artists and companions who came to the fore in New York in the 1940's and 50's. Her husband was close to Jackson Pollock and Barnett Newman, and she was the subject of one of Pollock's late black-and-white paintings, ''No. 7'' (1952), now owned by the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Two of her daughters, Kiki Smith and Seton Smith, are artists, adding to her prominence in the art world, but she made a career of her own in entertainment.         Jane Lawrence was born in Bozeman, Mont., in 1915 and raised in Mount Vernon, Wash. At 16, she began studying theater. By the time she was 18, she was living in New York and making her way in the theater. She appeared on Broadway in the original casts of ''Oklahoma!,'' ''Inside U.S.A.'' and ''Where's Charley?,'' the musical based on ''Charley's Aunt.'' As June Lawrence, she appeared in the Columbia Pictures movie ''Sailor's Holiday'' (1944), and she was also in three independent films.         In 1943 she married Tony Smith in Hollywood, with her close friend Tennessee Williams as best man. Her family said she helped inspire aspects of the character Blanche DuBois in Williams's ''Streetcar Named Desire.''         In 1950 she traveled to Europe and began an opera career in Germany; the next year she sang the part of Electra in the 1951 Salzburg Festival presentation of ''Idomeneo,'' conducted by Georg Solti. After her husband's death, in 1980, she resumed her acting career, this time in avant-garde theater, and worked with the directors John Jesurun, Joan Jonas and Marianne Weems.         Ms. Smith's daughter Beatrice Smith Robinson died in 1988. In addition to her daughters Kiki and Seton, who live in New York, she is survived by a granddaughter.       
         Ernesta Drinker Ballard, who saved the Philadelphia Flower Show and transformed it from a horticultural beauty show into a spectacular international educational event, died Aug. 11 at the Cathedral Village retirement community in Philadelphia. She was 85 and formerly lived in the Chestnut Hill area of Philadelphia.         The cause was complications of a stroke, her family said.         For 18 years, from 1963 to 1981, she was the executive director of the Pennsylvania Horticultural Society. Early in that period, the society's annual flower show, which began in 1829 and eventually grew into the largest indoor flower show in the United States was faltering, and a two-year suspension was discussed. Mrs. Ballard argued that a suspension might be fatal and instead changed the content of the show, bringing it to international prominence.         An exhibitor herself, she directed the show for 17 years, until 1981. She opened it to amateur growers and used it as a teaching laboratory for a wider public. Last year's show covered more than 30 acres with flower, garden and landscape displays and competitions, and lectures, workshops and cooking demonstrations. It drew more than a quarter million visitors.         Under Mrs. Ballard's guidance, the event began to produce a financial surplus, which she used to start the Horticultural Society's community gardening program, Philadelphia Green. That program, which turns vacant lots into vegetable gardens and flower beds, became one of the largest such urban greening projects in the nation.         Mrs. Ballard also played a leading role in saving public monuments like the Swann Fountain on Logan Circle and restoring the buildings and grounds of Philadelphia's historic Fairmount Waterworks. She was a Fairmount Park commissioner for 21 years, until 2002.         Ernesta Drinker was born into a distinguished Philadelphia family, a daughter of a prominent lawyer, Harry Drinker, and Sophie Hutcheson Drinker, a feminist and author. She was not encouraged to attend college but graduated as an adult from the Pennsylvania School of Horticulture for Women (now part of Temple University) in 1954, when she started her own greenhouse business.         Mrs. Ballard was also known as the ''godmother of Philadelphia feminism.'' She was a founder of local chapters of groups like the National Organization for Women and campaigned for the Equal Rights Amendment and abortion rights.         ''The Feminine Mystique'' (1963) by Betty Friedan propelled Mrs. Ballard toward feminism, and it was Ms. Friedan who invited her to start the NOW chapter. She was also a co-founder of Women's Way, a seminal Philadelphia fund-raising group that supports an array of women's organizations and causes.         Mrs. Ballard's husband, Frederic, a prominent lawyer and former president of the American Bonsai Association, died in 2001. She is survived by their son, Frederic L. Jr., of Bethesda, Md.; three daughters, Alice W. Ballard of Philadelphia, Sophie B. Bilezikian of Scarsdale, N.Y., and Ernesta Ballard of Ketchikan, Alaska; a sister, Cecilia D. Saltonstall of Exeter, N.H.; a brother, Henry Drinker of Bedford, Mass.; eight grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Nora Kerr, a longtime editor at The New York Times and a former editor of its Sunday Travel section, died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 61 and a Manhattan resident.         Ms. Kerr, who retired from the paper this month, died after having been ill with cancer for some years, her husband, Gordy Thompson, said.         Ms. Kerr joined The Times in 1976 as a copy editor; she was later editor of the paper's Westchester Weekly section and an assistant metropolitan editor. She was editor of the Travel section from 1986 to 1989, and was afterward an editor in The Times Magazine and the Arts & Leisure and Culture sections.         Nora Kerr was born on Nov. 19, 1943, in Cairo, where her parents had met during the war; the family later moved to New Jersey. She attended William Paterson College and Rutgers University and from 1967 to 1976 was a reporter and editor at The Bergen Record.         Ms. Kerr's first marriage ended in divorce. In addition to Mr. Thompson, a retired manager of Internet services at The Times, Ms. Kerr is survived by their son, Andrew Kerr-Thompson; her mother, Hermine, of Wayne, N.J.; and a sister, Jacqueline Kerr Harrold, of Benton, Pa.       
         Ruth Levine Sussman, an acting New York State Supreme Court justice who organized and headed the state system's first Integrated Domestic Violence Court, in the Bronx, died on Aug. 26 at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 46.         The cause was breast cancer, according to an announcement by Judith S. Kaye, chief judge of the Court of Appeals, who selected her in 2001 for the special panel, a pilot project for the state court system.         Justice Sussman grew up in Schenectady, N.Y. She graduated from Smith College in 1980 and received her law degree from Georgetown University's School of Law in 1983, then became an assistant prosecutor in the Manhattan district attorney's office.         Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani appointed her a Civil Court judge in 1995, after which she was assigned to Family Court and Criminal Court. She was named an acting justice of the State Supreme Court in 1999.         The Integrated Domestic Violence Court was created by Chief Judge Kaye to bring before a single judge all court proceedings involving domestic violence cases. Those include criminal, family and matrimonial issues that, under the prevailing system, were divided among the Criminal Court, Family Court and Supreme Court.         In her final days on the bench, in mid-June, Justice Sussman was conducting hearings under the Sex Offender Registration Act, known as Megan's Law, in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.         As she was being treated for her illness, Justice Sussman, helped by family and friends, raised money toward a Sussman Family Fund for research at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. The center said that the effort had contributed more than $500,000 to its breast cancer programs.         Justice Sussman is survived by her husband, David W. Sussman; their daughters, Jane and Rebecca; her parents, Judge Howard A. and Barbara Levine of Schenectady; and two brothers, Neil and James Levine, also of Schenectady.       
         Dr. Margot S. Kruskall, a Harvard hematologist and an expert on blood banks who was an early advocate for patients' donations of their own blood before surgery, a practice propelled by the spread of AIDS in the 1980's, died on Aug. 27 at her home in Dover, Mass. She was 56. The cause was ovarian cancer, her family said.         In 1982, when Dr. Kruskall headed Beth Israel Hospital's blood bank and hematology laboratory in Boston, she established a program for patients to donate and store their own blood, in large part stemming from concerns about hepatitis infections.         The practice, known as autologous donation, was known for more than a century, although it had never before been instituted on a wide scale. Dr. Kruskall and others at Beth Israel set up a system to label the blood, decided what surgical procedures were best served by it and created an inventory system.         The program's timing was propitious, coming just as H.I.V. was being recognized as a blood-borne virus.         When similar programs appeared nationwide, Dr. Kruskall and others analyzed their effectiveness and published the findings in the journal Transfusion in 1986. Autologous donations have since declined, largely because of closer controls on blood banks and the application of the hormone erythropoietin, which stimulates production of red blood cells and markedly reduces the need for blood transfusions.         Dr. Justine M. Carr, a hematologist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and a former director of the hematology lab there, said Dr. Kruskall began to research the viability of erythropoietin in the 1980's, helping to prove its effectiveness and determine dosages.         She and other scientists later developed a blood test to detect erythropoietin, which has been used by athletes to reduce muscle fatigue and illicitly enhance performance.         More recently, Dr. Kruskall pursued research to develop a kind of universal red blood cell that could be safely infused, regardless of a patient's blood type. She worked with Type B blood, modifying its red cells with enzymes to react like the cells in blood Type O, which can be received by most patients.         Margot Sheffield Kruskall was born in New York City. She earned an undergraduate degree from Jackson College of Tufts University, and her medical degree from the Medical College of Wisconsin in 1974.         She arrived at Beth Israel in 1976 and remained for the rest of her career, ultimately serving as director of the division of laboratory and transfusion medicine. Harvard appointed her an associate professor of medicine in 1992 and a professor of pathology in 2002.         Dr. Kruskall was an associate editor of Transfusion.         She is survived by her husband of 32 years, Dr. Stephen Kruskall, co-chairman of the emergency room at MetroWest Medical Center in Framingham, Mass.; a son, Peter; two daughters, Gillian and Lauren, all of Dover; and by a sister, Denni Day of Rochester.       
         Kathy Wilson, who as head of the National Women's Political Caucus in the 1980's lobbied on behalf of issues affecting women's lives, from the proposed equal rights amendment to the right to an abortion, died on Sept. 1 while vacationing in Rehoboth Beach, Del. She was 54 and lived in Alexandria, Va.         Ms. Wilson died in her sleep, apparently of heart failure, her sister-in-law Ann Goodrich said.         Founded in 1971, the National Women's Political Caucus is a bipartisan group that seeks to foster women's participation in the political process. Ms. Wilson was its chairwoman for two terms, from 1981 to 1985, and was previously its first vice chairwoman. In recent years, Ms. Wilson worked in early childhood education, the field in which she originally trained.         Among the changes Ms. Wilson advocated during her tenure were the election of more women to public office, the appointment of women to cabinet and other high-level government positions and equal pay for women.         An almost life-long Republican, she became an outspoken critic of President Ronald Reagan and supported the candidacy of Walter F. Mondale and Geraldine A. Ferraro in the 1984 presidential race.         ''I believe in individual rights and the absence of government interference in those rights,'' she told People magazine in 1983. She added: ''I have worked for scores of Republican candidates, but I'm not going to toe the party line when I have a president who seeks to send me down the time tunnel as a woman.''         Kathleen Anne Higdon was born in Quonset Point, R.I., the daughter of a Navy pilot and a homemaker. The family moved wherever her father's job took them, settling in St. Louis when she was a teenager. The Higdons were ardent Republicans, and much of Ms. Wilson's ideology was forged at the dining-room table.         Ms. Wilson earned a bachelor's degree in education, with a concentration in special education, from the University of Missouri in 1973; she married a fellow student, Paul O. Wilson, the next year. In 1976, she earned a master's in education from Missouri.         After college, Ms. Wilson worked briefly as a flight attendant for Trans World Airlines, a job that she quickly came to loathe, her family said. She then worked in the convention sales department of a Kansas City hotel; in less than a year, she was the top saleswoman there. But after spending several months training two male employees to do the job, Ms. Wilson discovered that they were being paid $100 more a month than she was.         ''I walked out,'' she told The New York Times in 1981, ''and joined the women's movement.''         Moving to Washington in 1977 to work as a research analyst for the Department of Labor, Ms. Wilson remained politically active. She founded several chapters of the women's political caucus, including its Northern Virginia chapter, before becoming involved with the national organization.         Ms. Wilson's full-time entry into politics coincided with her years as a young mother. When her children were small, she often took them to out-of-town engagements, presenting what she viewed as a living demonstration of the compatibility of career and family. She attended the 1980 Republican National Convention -- visibly pregnant -- with a button supporting abortion rights pinned conspicuously to her lapel.         Ms. Wilson is survived by her husband, a Republican political consultant; a daughter, Casey Rose Wilson, of New York City and Los Angeles; a son, Fletcher Todd Wilson, a student at the University of Pennsylvania; her father, Marion Higdon, of Pensacola, Fla.; and a brother, Bruce D. Higdon, also of Pensacola.         For the last 14 years, Ms. Wilson worked as the director of a preschool in Alexandria. A few years ago, her sister-in-law said, she left the Republican Party.       
         Toni Trent Parker, an author who helped advance the cause of books featuring African-American children, died on Thursday at her home in Stamford, Conn. She was 58.         The cause was a brain tumor, her family said.         To increase the visibility of black children in children's books, Ms. Parker and two friends, Donna Rand and Sheila Foster, established a company to help promote such books and later wrote a series of four guides, ''Black Books Galore! Guide to Great African American Children's Books.'' The guides, first published in 1998 by John Wiley & Sons, are available at www.blackbooksgalore.com.         Children's picture books featuring or including minority children were largely absent before the 1960's, when the first few were published and authors and other advocates began criticizing what they viewed as prejudice in the publishing industry, said Leonard S. Marcus, a book reviewer for Parenting magazine.         By promoting sales, raising awareness and adding to the literature, Ms. Parker helped bring more books with black children into the mainstream, he said.         In 1998 she established Kids Cultural Books, a nonprofit organization that holds book festivals around the country to bring multicultural books and their authors together with children. The organization received a grant from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation in 2000.         Ms. Parker wrote six children's picture books, including holiday books and a keepsake book, all picturing black children. Her most recent title, ''Sienna's Scrapbook'' (Chronicle Books, 2005), portrays an young African-American girl and her family visiting black cultural and historical sites in the United States.         Toni Trent Parker was born in 1947 in Winston-Salem, N.C. She earned a bachelor's degree in history from Oberlin College in 1970, and did graduate work at the University of California, Berkeley.         Ms. Parker is survived by her husband, Judge Barrington D. Parker Jr. of Stamford, who is on the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit; their daughters, Christine, Kathleen and Jennifer, all of Stamford; her mother, Viola Trent of Greensboro, N.C.; and two sisters, Kay Holloway of Potomac, Md., and Judy Scales-Trent of Buffalo, N.Y.       
         Honey Bruce Friedman, a former nightclub entertainer who in 2003 helped win a posthumous pardon for her ex-husband, the comedian Lenny Bruce, on a 39-year-old obscenity conviction, died on Sept. 12 at a hospital in Honolulu. She was 78 and a Honolulu resident.         The cause was complications of colitis, her daughter, Kitty Bruce, said.         At various times a singer, dancer, stripper, carnival performer, film actress, clothing designer and memoirist, Ms. Friedman was married to Bruce from 1951 until their divorce in 1957. Bruce died of a drug overdose in 1966, at 40.         In 2003, Gov. George E. Pataki of New York pardoned Bruce, who was convicted in 1964 of giving obscene performances at the Cafe au Go Go in Greenwich Village. With her daughter, Ms. Friedman lent her support to the campaign to win the pardon.         Ms. Friedman was born Harriett Jolliff in Manila, Ark., on Aug. 15, 1927, and raised in Detroit. As a teenager, she ran away from home to dance with a carnival. While still in her teens, she was convicted, along with several friends, of attempting to rob a candy machine, and spent more than a year in jail.         Shortly after her release, she began working as a stripper under the name Hot Honey Harlowe. After an early marriage that ended in divorce, she wed Bruce, breaking off a relationship with a woman she loved to be with him.         The couple's six-year marriage was Ozzie and Harriet as reimagined by William S. Burroughs. Ms. Friedman sewed outfits for Bruce. They shopped for wallpaper. They injected heroin. She served jail time for marijuana possession.         In later years, Ms. Friedman, who overcame addictions to drugs and alcohol, designed clothing, with a shop in Honolulu. She was the author of a memoir, ''Honey: The Life and Loves of Lenny's Shady Lady'' (Playboy Press, 1976, with Dana Benenson).         Ms. Friedman appeared in two films, ''Dance Hall Racket'' (1953), which also starred Bruce and his mother, Sally Marr; and ''Princess of the Nile'' (1954). She was featured in the 1998 documentary ''Lenny Bruce: Swear to Tell the Truth,'' and was portrayed by Valerie Perrine in Bob Fosse's film ''Lenny'' (1974).         Besides her daughter, who lives in Pennsylvania, Ms. Friedman is survived by her husband, Jeffrey Friedman, whom she married in 1984.       
         Sandra Feldman, the blunt-spoken former president of the American Federation of Teachers and its local in New York, who emerged from the shadow of her mentor, Albert Shanker, to become a deft and intimidating labor powerhouse on her own, died Sunday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 65.         Alex Wohl, a spokesman for the national union, which Ms. Feldman led from 1997 to 2004, said the cause was breast cancer, which recurred last year and deterred Ms. Feldman from seeking re-election.         A scrappy fighter who rarely minced words, the Brooklyn-born Ms. Feldman took on mayors, school chancellors and American presidents with the same inattention to ceremony with which she dispatched rivals for her union leadership.         As head of the American Federation of Teachers, the nation's second-largest union, with 1.3 million members, she was an impassioned advocate for the public schools that educated her. She worked with members of the Bush administration and members of Congress to write the education law known as No Child Left Behind, which imposed stricter performance standards on all schools receiving federal aid. But she was not timid about assailing President Bush when she thought he was not funneling enough resources to sustain those standards.         She put the power of the United Federation of Teachers, the New York local, with 110,000 members at the time, behind the election of David N. Dinkins as mayor in 1989, an effort that helped him garner white votes. But when he disappointed her by letting a year pass without a new contract, she publicly let him know. ''I feel angry at him,'' she said, and added, ''The mayor had better understand that I'd fight him to the end for the needs of my members.''         At one point in the late 1980's, she fought so ardently for Bernard Gifford to become New York City schools chancellor that Robert F. Wagner Jr., the president of the Board of Education, threatened to resign unless Ms. Feldman backed off.         ''She is part shop steward, part visionary,'' Mr. Wagner said in a comment at the time that seemed to capture her earthy charm.         Yet, even as she could be fierce in fighting battles like smaller class sizes, she had an artful touch in private dealings over the brass-tacks issues of pensions and benefits and often veiled her thoughts.         Randi Weingarten, who succeeded Ms. Feldman as president of the United Federation of Teachers, said, ''People remember her take-no-prisoners kind of attitude, but Sandy was far more pragmatic than people give her credit for.'' She recalled how in 1991 the Dinkins administration planned to lay off 4,000 paraprofessionals, and to save those jobs Ms. Feldman agreed to defer a $40 million portion of a 5 1/2 percent wage increase she had negotiated not long before. ''She was courageous in explaining the difficulties to her members,'' Ms. Weingarten said.         The person to whom she was most wedded in the public eye was Mr. Shanker, who built a rudderless collection of local unions into the United Federation of Teachers, which came to have perhaps the most powerful voice in who would become chancellor. As a 29-year-old union field representative, she was often at Mr. Shanker's side in 1968 when he locked horns with an experimental, largely black community school district in Ocean Hill-Brownsville, Brooklyn, that tried to transfer 13 white, mostly Jewish teachers and administrators.         The conflict was fraught with charges of anti-Semitism and racism, and Ms. Feldman was in a difficult position, having been an advocate for civil rights, working to integrate Howard Johnson restaurants along Route 40 in Maryland. Her instincts were at first to avoid confrontation, Ms. Weingarten recalled.         Although the battle culminated in legislation creating a diluted version of community control in a decentralized school system, the union, by going on strike three times, had proved it could shut down the schools at will and, in a fragmented system, it emerged more powerful than ever with increased job protections for its members.         Hardened in that caldron, Ms. Feldman became the union's secretary and took over its presidency in 1986, when Mr. Shanker became head of the national union. She battled chancellors and mayors for significantly higher pay and improved working conditions for her members.         ''Having lived through the contentious teachers' strikes of the late 1960's, she was wary of any effort to remove due process protections from her membership,'' said Diane Ravitch, the education scholar.         Detractors in government said she sometimes protected teachers' rights at the expense of students, by, for example, winning concessions that put aides rather than teachers in charge of discipline in hallways and cafeterias. Critics also pointed out that she never abandoned her insistence that the school system should not have the right to reassign seasoned teachers to failing schools, even if they were needed there most.         As head of the American Federation of Teachers, she worked to increase federal and state spending for programs for the youngest children in a program she called Kindergarten Plus. She also tried unsuccessfully to devise a merger with the largest national union, the National Education Association.         Ms. Feldman, whom almost everyone called Sandy, was born Sandra Abramowitz in Coney Island in October 1939, about six weeks after the outbreak of war in Europe. The daughter of a milkman and a sickly woman who worked part time in a bakery, she grew up in a tenement and later in a public housing project.         She went to James Madison High School and studied English at Brooklyn College, where she immersed herself in socialist politics and civil rights activities. After her freshman year she married Paul Feldman, whom she met at the college literary magazine. They divorced 17 years later.         Her first full-time appointment was to Public School 34 on the Lower East Side, where she taught fourth grade for three years. ''When I came into that school, there was only one union member,'' she said. ''I organized it immediately.''         She loved to read fiction and sometimes went dancing in salsa and jazz clubs with her second husband, Arthur H. Barnes, senior vice president for external affairs of HIP Health Plan of New York.         Besides Mr. Barnes, she is survived by a brother, Larry Abramowitz of New York City; a sister, Helen Berliner of Wylie, Tex.; two stepchildren, David Barnes and Donna Marie Barnes; and two grandchildren.       
         Molly Yard, for more than half a century an outspoken advocate for liberal causes, who came to national prominence as president of the National Organization for Women in the late 1980's, died yesterday at a nursing home in Pittsburgh. She was 93 and had resided most recently in Arlington, Va., and Washington.         Ms. Yard's son James Garrett confirmed her death.         Active since the 1930's in student and civil rights movements, Ms. Yard served as NOW's president from 1987 until 1991. She was previously the organization's political director.         During her tenure, NOW championed issues including abortion, gay and lesbian rights and the election of women to public office. In 1987, in one of its most vigorous campaigns, it opposed the nomination to the Supreme Court of Judge Robert H. Bork, whom Ms. Yard publicly condemned as ''a Neanderthal.'' She also called for the impeachment of President Ronald Reagan over the Iran-contra affair.         Ms. Yard spent so much time pounding unforgiving marble in various corridors of power that she developed permanent nerve damage in her feet, The Washington Post reported in 1987.         Mary Alexander Yard was born in Shanghai on July 6, 1912, and raised in Chengdu, the capital of Sichuan Province, where her parents were Methodist missionaries. At her birth, one of her father's male friends presented him with a beautiful brass bowl. It was meant as a consolation prize. Ms. Yard was the family's third daughter.         Growing up in China, Ms. Yard later said, helped set her on her course as a social activist. She saw many people die of cholera. She also heard screams whose source she could not immediately identify.         ''I asked my father what was going on, and he said it was a young girl whose feet are bound,'' Ms. Yard told The Post in 1987. ''They used to unbind them at night in order for the blood to circulate.''         The Yards lived in China until Ms. Yard was about 13, when her father angered church superiors by proposing that their missions in China be turned over to the Chinese. The family moved to the United States, where Mr. Yard became the director of religious activities for Northwestern University -- until he angered superiors there with his work as a civil rights and labor organizer. Through much of the Depression, Ms. Yard's mother, who ran a mail-order business selling imported Chinese goods, was the family's sole support.         Ms. Yard became politically active as a student at Swarthmore. After discovering that the sorority to which she belonged would not admit Jews, she campaigned successfully to abolish all sororities on campus. She graduated in 1933, with a bachelor's degree in political science.         In 1938, Ms. Yard married a Swarthmore classmate, Sylvester Garrett, keeping her maiden name. When the couple tried to open a joint checking account, Ms. Yard would later recall, they were told they could not do so under two different surnames. If only Ms. Yard had been Mr. Garrett's mistress, the bank told her, it would have been no problem at all.         Mr. Garrett, a noted labor arbitrator who taught at Stanford and elsewhere, died in 1996. Besides her son, of McDonald, Pa., Ms. Yard is survived by another son, John Garrett, of Fairport, N.Y., and five grandchildren. A daughter, Joan Garrett-Goodyear, died in 1992.         After college, Ms. Yard began a career as a social worker but soon realized that politics was a better outlet for her unrelenting energy. As an officer of the American Student Union, a left-wing youth organization, Ms. Yard struck up a long friendship with Eleanor Roosevelt, whom she credited as a deep influence. Ms. Yard was later a board member of Americans for Democratic Action.         During her husband's years at Stanford, Ms. Yard immersed herself in Democratic politics in California, supporting Representative Helen Gahagan Douglas in her Senate race against Richard M. Nixon in 1950. After her family moved to Pittsburgh a few years later, Ms. Yard worked in the civil rights movement and was a local organizer for the March on Washington in 1963. She entered electoral politics as a candidate only once, running unsuccessfully for the Pennsylvania legislature in 1964.         Ms. Yard joined NOW in the early 1970's and for the next decade worked on its campaign, ultimately unsuccessful, to have the equal rights amendment ratified. In 1987, Eleanor Smeal, Ms. Yard's mentor and NOW's departing president, suggested she run for the position. In her mid-70's, Ms. Yard demurred at first.         ''I thought if I were 10 years younger, I would love to do it,'' she told People magazine in 1987. ''Then I remembered Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony never stopped, even in their 80's.''         Ms. Yard's reputation as a forceful negotiator stood her in such good stead that she did not have to be physically present to get results. In 1987, Patricia Blau Reuss, who was the legislative director for the Women's Equity Action League at the time, told The Washington Post what it was like to lobby members of Congress with Ms. Yard as a bargaining chip:         ''We would say, 'Look, you either deal with me or you have to answer to Molly,''' Ms. Reuss said. ''They always relent.''       
         Lea Nikel, an abstract painter who was one of Israel's most esteemed artists, died on Sept. 10 at her home in Moshav Kidron, Israel. She was 86.         The cause was cancer, her nephew Yehuda Bock said.         Ms. Nikel devoted a career of more than 50 years to a form of expressionistic abstraction sometimes called lyrical abstraction. Painting with a brusque, generous touch and favoring high-keyed colors, she created buoyant compositions consisting of rough-edged blocks of color and scribbly, calligraphic lines that together convey a sense of imaginative excitement and urgent sensuousness.         Ms. Nikel was born Lea Nikelsberg in Zhitomir, Ukraine, in 1918, and emigrated with her parents to British Mandatory Palestine in 1920. She began studying with the painter Chaim Gliksberg in Tel Aviv in 1935. A decade later, she studied with Yehezkel Streichman and Avigdor Stematsky, who started their own school because they thought Israeli art schools were too conservative.         Ms. Nikel lived and worked in Paris from 1950 to 1961. She had her first solo exhibition at Chemerinsky Art Gallery in Tel Aviv and her first solo show in Paris at Galerie Colette Allendy in 1957. In 1995, the Tel Aviv Museum of Art presented a career retrospective exhibition of her paintings.         From 1961 to 1977, Ms. Nikel led a peripatetic life. She lived on Macdougal Street in Greenwich Village for a year in the early 60's; in Rome for three years at the end of the 60's; and, from 1973 to 1977, at the Chelsea Hotel in New York. After that she remained in Israel.         Ms. Nikel was included in numerous international group exhibitions, including the Venice Biennale in 1964. In 1995 she received the Israel Prize for painting and in 1997 was made a Chevalier of Arts and Letters by the French minister of culture.         Ms. Nikel continued to paint until just a few days before her death, and it is a measure of the continued vitality of her late work that the Sommer Gallery in Tel Aviv, which specializes in young and emerging artists, mounted an exhibition of new works by her in 2002.         Ms. Nikel is survived by her husband, Sam Leiman; her daughter, Ziva Hanan; three grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren, all of Moshav Kidron; and a sister, Sara Bock, of Rockaway Beach, Queens.       
         Franzi Groszmann, who was believed to be among the last survivors of the parents who put their London-bound children on trains to escape Nazi persecution, in the famed Kindertransport, died on Sept. 20 in Manhattan. She was 100.         Deborah Oppenheimer, producer of the 2000 movie ''Into the Arms of Strangers: Stories of the Kindertransport,'' announced the death.         Ms. Oppenheimer, whose own mother was a Kindertransport child, said she believed that Mrs. Groszmann was the last surviving mother who had placed a child (the author Lore Segal) on a train from Germany, Austria or Czechoslovakia to seek safety in Britain.         The British government had eased immigration restrictions for children under 17 after the violent attack on Jews in Germany in November 1938 known as Kristallnacht, or Night of the Broken Glass.         ''In no time, the suitcase was gone, the child was gone, the other children were gone -- just emptiness,'' Mrs. Groszmann said in the film about watching Lore board the train in Vienna. ''I did not talk. It was awful.''         She relaxed only after she received a postcard from Lore in England saying she was safe.         Ms. Segal told about the Kindertransport (Children's Transport) in her autobiographical novel, ''Other People's Houses,'' drawing a loving portrait of a charming and capable mother. From Dec. 2, 1938, until May 14, 1940, 9,000 to 10,000 children, 7,500 of them Jewish, were sent to Britain.         Each was allowed only one suitcase and one backpack, and was known only by a number. Lore was 152.         The mother and daughter also appeared in Melissa Hacker's Academy Award-winning 1996 film ''My Knees Were Jumping.''         Mrs. Groszmann's husband and Lore's father was Ignatz, the chief accountant of a Vienna bank, who was fired after Hitler took over Austria. At that time Lore was their only child.         In later years, when Lore thought of boarding the train, she had ''no clear recollection'' of her father's being there. She wrote, ''Every time I looked toward them it was my mother's tiny face . . . that I saw smiling steadily toward me.''         In England, Lore met the first of five foster families; with none of them would she feel comfortable. In an interview with The Jewish Week in 2001, she said her mother wrote her: ''Be good. Be obedient. Be neat. Be tidy. Always be nice.''         On the instructions her father gave her before leaving, Lore wrote the Jewish refugee committee asking it to get her parents out of Austria, as well as her grandparents, aunt and twin cousins. Her request was granted, and her parents and the others emigrated to England.         But they found work as domestic servants and could not have children living with them. . She did not live with her relatives again until after the war, when she joined them in the Dominican Republic at the age of 21.         For a time, her father was interned on the Isle of Man as a German-speaking alien. He died in the final week of the war after suffering a series of strokes. Mrs. Groszmann and her daughter lived in a small flat while Lore attended Bedford College in London.         Ms. Segal and her mother and grandmother immigrated to New York from the Dominican Republic in 1951 and lived together in a small apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Mrs. Groszmann worked as a salad cook at Schrafft's and as a sales clerk at a Washington Heights bakery. After helping Lore with her first baby, she trained herself to become a nurse.         In addition to Ms. Segal, Mrs. Groszmann is survived by her brother, Paul Stern, two grandchildren and two great-grandsons.         For many years, Mrs. Groszmann and Ms. Segal lived in different apartments in the same building on Riverside Drive in Manhattan. Each day at 7 a.m., the daughter would take the elevator down to have breakfast with her mother, who until three years ago rose at dawn to squeeze grapefruit juice for the two of them.       
         Betty Leslie-Melville, who called herself ''a total giraffe junkie'' and proved it not only by helping save a giraffe breed from extinction, but also by living amid the animals in a home called Giraffe Manor, died on Sept. 23 at a hospice in Baltimore. She was 78.         The cause was complications of dementia, said her husband, Vice Adm. George Peabody Steele.         In the 1970's, Ms. Leslie-Melville helped snatch a patch of land near Nairobi, in Kenya, before developers could turn it into subdivisions, and she made it a sanctuary for the Rothschild giraffe, a subspecies.         The population, once around 120, is now 300 to 400 in Kenya, and perhaps 500 in all of Africa, partly because of her efforts and those of her husband at the time, Jock Leslie-Melville, who died in 1984. The couple helped save part of 18,000 acres as natural habitat. They also helped set up giraffe preserves in four national parks in Kenya.         Others of the resurgent population of Rothschild giraffes, which are characterized by white legs and five horns, live in the Giraffe Center surrounding Giraffe Manor, near Nairobi. The Leslie-Melvilles were among the earliest conservationists to raise a wild giraffe.         Ms. Leslie-Melville founded a conservation organization called the African Fund for Endangered Wildlife USA, and Mr. Leslie-Melville, a Kenyan citizen, started a separate branch for Kenya. They began the organization by bringing five giraffe babies to their own preserve.         Mr. and Ms. Leslie-Melville collaborated on about 10 books on conservation topics and opened their center to visits from tens of thousands of local schoolchildren; most of them had never seen many of their own country's threatened species.         Ms. Leslie-Melville made their home into an inn after Mr. Leslie-Melville died. Giraffes regularly poke their noses into the windows of upper-floor guest rooms. A double room with lunch now goes for $595 a night, and much of the revenue is used for the conservation of giraffes and other species, including the black rhinoceros and the African elephant. The inn is now run by Rick Anderson, Ms. Leslie-Melville's son from her first marriage, to Lloyd Anderson, which ended in divorce.         In addition to her husband and son, Ms. Leslie-Melville is survived by her daughter, Dancy Bruce Mills of Glen Arm, Md., and five grandchildren. Another son, McDonnell Marshall Bruce, died in 2004.         Betty McDonnell was born in Baltimore and eventually moved back there in the 1980's. She attended Johns Hopkins University, ran a nursery school with her sister and worked as a fashion model. She first went to Africa in 1958 to visit a friend who was a member of the White Sisters, a Roman Catholic religious order.         She fell in love with the continent. ''You go there, and it's like you're in a Technicolor world,'' she said in a 1994 profile of her in The Baltimore Sun. ''It's magic.''         She persuaded her second husband, Danny Bruce, to move to Kenya. He ran a nonhunting safari business; their marriage ended in divorce.         She then married Mr. Leslie-Melville, who had been raised in Africa and was the grandson of a Scottish earl. They bought the stone manor house that became the inn.         Their giraffe-centered vacations became a staple of travel writers, and visits by Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall, Marlon Brando, Brooke Shields and other celebrities hardly hurt. In a particularly imaginative stroke, the Leslie-Melvilles named a warthog that lived on their property Cronkite, after Walter Cronkite, the CBS news anchor, and wrote a book about the animal.         They were also adept at raising money through receptions and dinners, often inviting guests to come in formal or safari clothing, or some combination of the two.         At one such event, the couple were auctioned off as a maid and butler. The buyer ordered them to serve a dinner party at his home.         Mr. and Ms. Leslie-Melville went there expecting to prepare loin of lamb, only to discover that they had misunderstood their boss for the evening. The main course was loin of lion.         They protested mightily, but finally prepared the meal. They did not partake.       
         Shirley Horn, a jazz singer and pianist who drew audiences close with a powerfully confidential, vibratoless delivery, died yesterday at a nursing home in Cheverly, Md. She was 71. Her death was announced by Regina Joskow, vice president of publicity at the Verve Music Group, Ms. Horn's label.         Ms. Horn was a unique singer, with one of the slowest deliveries in jazz and a very unusual way of phrasing, putting stress on certain words and letting others slip away. She cherished her repertory, making audiences feel that she was cutting through to the stark truths of songs like ''Here's to Life'' and ''You Won't Forget Me.'' She wanted things just so: she stuck with her drummer, Steve Williams, for 23 years, and her bassist, Charles Ables -- who died in 2002 -- for 33.         She lived all her life in and around Washington, often performing close to home to be near her family. But over the last two decades she enjoyed a quietly expanding revival of the concert and club career she had begun in the 1950's, and she became a star in the jazz world.         When she was 4, her mother had her start piano lessons. In her teens she won a scholarship to Juilliard, but it was decided that living in New York would cost the family too much money; she studied classical music at Howard University in Washington instead.         She recalled that at 17, while she was playing classical music at a restaurant in Washington, a man appeared in front of her with a four-foot-tall turquoise teddy bear. ''If you sing 'Melancholy Baby,''' he said, ''I'll give you this bear.'' She did, and he did.         At the time Ms. Horn was shy and largely focused on classical music, but she often cited this as the moment when it dawned on her that if she overcame her reluctance to sing and to play jazz in public, she might be able to make a living at it. About her transition from classical to jazz, she liked to say: ''I loved Rachmaninoff, but then Oscar Peterson became my Rachmaninoff. And Ahmad Jamal became my Debussy.''         From 1954, she led her own jazz trio in Washington. In 1960 she recorded her first album, ''Embers and Ashes,'' for a small label called Stere-o-Craft. It was not widely heard, but Miles Davis heard it, and a year later he tracked down her telephone number in Washington and invited her to open for him at the Village Vanguard in New York. That exposure, plus the help of the jazz agent and manager John Levy, helped get her a contract with Mercury Records.         Mercury signed Ms. Horn as a singer, not a singer-pianist. Although some of the great piano-playing accompanists, including Hank Jones and Jimmy Jones, were hired to play on her records, and although ''Loads of Love,'' from 1962, showcased her voice well -- she could sound like a quieter, subtler version of Dinah Washington -- the situation made her uncomfortable.         By the mid-1960's she had stopped touring and decided to restrict her performing to the Washington and Baltimore areas so she could spend more time at home raising her daughter, Rainy. From 1963 to 1978 she made only two records -- ''Travelin' Light'' for ABC-Paramount and ''Where Are You Going?'' for Perception. From 1978 to 1984, she recorded for the Danish label Steeplechase and slowly came back into the awareness of jazz fans.         In 1982, she played her first New York performance in more than 15 years, at Michael's Pub, and in 1986 she was signed by Verve. The company built up her career all over again over the course of 11 albums, including ''You Won't Forget Me'' (1990), which featured guest appearances by Miles Davis and Wynton Marsalis; ''I Remember Miles'' (1998), which won a Grammy Award; and a few that featured string sections.         Ms. Horn's survivors include her husband, Sheppard Deering, of Upper Marlboro, Md.; her daughter, Rainy Smith, of Maryland; and several grandchildren.         Ms. Horn had been fighting breast cancer for some time when complications of diabetes led to the amputation of her right foot in 2002. For a few years she performed sitting in a chair and facing the audience directly, away from the piano, which was played by George Mesterhazy. But in her final performances in New York, a two-week stretch at Le Jazz Au Bar that started last Dec. 30, she was back at the piano again, with the help of a prosthetic device that helped her to use the instrument's sustain pedal.         Three of those performances will be released in October on a Verve anthology of her work, ''But Beautiful: The Best of Shirley Horn.''       
         Rosa Parks, a black seamstress whose refusal to relinquish her seat to a white man on a city bus in Montgomery, Ala., almost 50 years ago grew into a mythic event that helped touch off the civil rights movement of the 1950's and 1960's, died yesterday at her home in Detroit. She was 92 years old.         Her death was confirmed by Dennis W. Archer, the former mayor of Detroit.         For her act of defiance, Mrs. Parks was arrested, convicted of violating the segregation laws and fined $10, plus $4 in court fees. In response, blacks in Montgomery boycotted the buses for nearly 13 months while mounting a successful Supreme Court challenge to the Jim Crow law that enforced their second-class status on the public bus system.         The events that began on that bus in the winter of 1955 captivated the nation and transformed a 26-year-old preacher named Martin Luther King Jr. into a major civil rights leader. It was Dr. King, the new pastor of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery, who was drafted to head the Montgomery Improvement Association, the organization formed to direct the nascent civil rights struggle.         ''Mrs. Parks's arrest was the precipitating factor rather than the cause of the protest,'' Dr. King wrote in his 1958 book, ''Stride Toward Freedom. ''The cause lay deep in the record of similar injustices.''         Her act of civil disobedience, what seems a simple gesture of defiance so many years later, was in fact a dangerous, even reckless move in 1950's Alabama. In refusing to move, she risked legal sanction and perhaps even physical harm, but she also set into motion something far beyond the control of the city authorities. Mrs. Parks clarified for people far beyond Montgomery the cruelty and humiliation inherent in the laws and customs of segregation.         That moment on the Cleveland Avenue bus also turned a very private woman into a reluctant symbol and torchbearer in the quest for racial equality and of a movement that became increasingly organized and sophisticated in making demands and getting results.         ''She sat down in order that we might stand up,'' the Rev. Jesse Jackson said yesterday in an interview from South Africa. ''Paradoxically, her imprisonment opened the doors for our long journey to freedom.''         Even in the last years of her life, the frail Mrs. Parks made appearances at events and commemorations, saying little but lending the considerable strength of her presence. In recent years, she suffered from dementia, according to medical records released during a lawsuit over the use of her name by the hip-hop group OutKast.Over the years myth tended to obscure the truth about Mrs. Parks. One legend had it that she was a cleaning woman with bad feet who was too tired to drag herself to the rear of the bus. Another had it that she was a ''plant'' by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People.         The truth, as she later explained, was that she was tired of being humiliated, of having to adapt to the byzantine rules, some codified as law and others passed on as tradition, that reinforced the position of blacks as something less than full human beings.         ''She was fed up,'' said Elaine Steele, a longtime friend and executive director of the Rosa and Raymond Parks Institute for Self Development. ''She was in her 40's. She was not a child. There comes a point where you say, 'No, I'm a full citizen, too. This is not the way I should be treated.'''         In ''Stride Toward Freedom,'' Dr. King wrote, ''Actually no one can understand the action of Mrs. Parks unless he realizes that eventually the cup of endurance runs over, and the human personality cries out, 'I can take it no longer.'''         Mrs. Parks was very active in the Montgomery N.A.A.C.P. chapter, and she and her husband, Raymond, a barber, had taken part in voter registration drives.         At the urging of an employer, Virginia Durr, Mrs. Parks had attended an interracial leadership conference at the Highlander Folk School in Monteagle, Tenn., in the summer of 1955. There, she later said, she ''gained strength to persevere in my work for freedom, not just for blacks but for all oppressed people.''         But as she rushed home from her job as a seamstress at a department store on Dec. 1, 1955, the last thing on her mind was becoming ''the mother of the civil rights movement,'' as many would later describe her. She had to send out notices of the N.A.A.C.P.'s coming election of officers. And she had to prepare for the workshop that she was running for teenagers that weekend.         ''So it was not a time for me to be planning to get arrested,'' she said in an interview in 1988.         On Montgomery buses, the first four rows were reserved for whites. The rear was for blacks, who made up more than 75 percent of the bus system's riders. Blacks could sit in the middle rows until those seats were needed by whites. Then the blacks had to move to seats in the rear, stand or, if there was no room, leave the bus. Even getting on the bus presented hurdles: If whites were already sitting in the front, blacks could board to pay the fare but then they had to disembark and re-enter through the rear door.         For years blacks had complained, and Mrs. Parks was no exception. ''My resisting being mistreated on the bus did not begin with that particular arrest,'' she said. ''I did a lot of walking in Montgomery.''         After a confrontation in 1943, a driver named James Blake ejected Mrs. Parks from his bus. As fate would have it, he was driving the Cleveland Avenue bus on Dec. 1, 1955. He demanded that four blacks give up their seats in the middle section so a lone white man could sit. Three of them complied.         Recalling the incident for ''Eyes on the Prize,'' a 1987 public television series on the civil rights movement, Mrs. Parks said: ''When he saw me still sitting, he asked if I was going to stand up and I said, 'No, I'm not.' And he said, 'Well, if you don't stand up, I'm going to have to call the police and have you arrested.' I said, 'You may do that.'''         Her arrest was the answer to prayers for the Women's Political Council, which was set up in 1946 in response to the mistreatment of black bus riders, and for E.D. Nixon, a leading advocate of equality for blacks in Montgomery.         Blacks had been arrested, and even killed, for disobeying bus drivers. They had begun to build a case around a 15-year-old girl's arrest for refusing to give up her seat, and Mrs. Parks had been among those raising money for the girl's defense. But when they learned that the girl was pregnant, they decided that she was an unsuitable symbol for their cause.         Mrs. Parks, on the other hand, was regarded as ''one of the finest citizens of Montgomery -- not one of the finest Negro citizens -- but one of the finest citizens of Montgomery,'' Dr. King said.         While Mr. Nixon met with lawyers and preachers to plan an assault on the Jim Crow laws, the women's council distributed 35,000 copies of a handbill that urged blacks to boycott the buses on Monday, Dec. 5, the day of Mrs. Parks's trial.         ''Don't ride the buses to work, to town, to school, or anywhere on Monday,'' the leaflet said.         On Sunday, Dec. 4, the announcement was made from many black pulpits, and a front-page article in The Montgomery Advertiser, a black newspaper, further spread the word.         Some blacks rode in carpools that Monday. Others rode in black-owned taxis that charged only the bus fare, 10 cents. But most black commuters -- 40,000 people -- walked, some more than 20 miles.         At a church rally that night, blacks unanimously agreed to continue the boycott until these demands were met: that they be treated with courtesy, that black drivers be hired, and that seating in the middle of the bus go on a first-come basis.         The boycott lasted 381 days, and in that period many blacks were harassed and arrested on flimsy excuses. Churches and houses, including those of Dr. King and Mr. Nixon, were dynamited.         Finally, on Nov. 13, 1956, in Browder v. Gayle, the Supreme Court outlawed segregation on buses. The court order arrived in Montgomery on Dec. 20; the boycott ended the next day. But the violence escalated: snipers fired into buses as well as Dr. King's home, and bombs were tossed into churches and into the homes of ministers.         Early the next year, the Parkses left Montgomery for Hampton, Va., largely because Mrs. Parks had been unable to find work, but also because of disagreements with Dr. King and other leaders of the city's struggling civil rights movement.         Later that year, at the urging of her younger brother, Sylvester, Mrs. Parks, her husband and her mother, Leona McCauley, moved to Detroit. Mrs. Parks worked as a seamstress until 1965, when Representative John Conyers Jr. hired her as an aide for his Congressional office in Detroit. She retired in 1988.         ''There are very few people who can say their actions and conduct changed the face of the nation,'' Mr. Conyers said yesterday in a statement, ''and Rosa Parks is one of those individuals.''         Mrs. Parks's husband, Raymond, died in 1977. There are no immediate survivors.         In the last decade, Mrs. Parks was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom and the Congressional Gold Medal. But even as she remained an icon of textbooks , her final years were troubled. She was hospitalized after a 28-year-old man beat her in her home and stole $53. She had problems paying her rent, relying on a local church for support until last December, when her landlord stopped charging her rent.         Rosa Louise McCauley was born in Tuskegee, Ala., on Feb. 4, 1913, the elder of Leona and James McCauley's two children. Although the McCauleys were farmers, Mr. McCauley also worked as a carpenter and Mrs. McCauley as a teacher.         Rosa McCauley attended rural schools until she was 11 years old, then Miss White's School for Girls in Montgomery. She attended high school at the Alabama State Teachers College, but dropped out to care for her ailing grandmother. It was not until she was 21 that she earned a high school diploma.         Shy and soft-spoken, Mrs. Parks often appeared uncomfortable with the near-beatification bestowed upon her by blacks, who revered her as a symbol of their quest for dignity and equality. She would say that she hoped only to inspire others, especially young people, ''to be dedicated enough to make useful lives for themselves and to help others.''         She also expressed fear that since the birthday of Dr. King became a national holiday, his image was being watered down and he was being depicted as merely a ''dreamer.''         ''As I remember him, he was more than a dreamer,'' Mrs. Parks said. ''He was an activist who believed in acting as well as speaking out against oppression.''         She would laugh in recalling some of her experiences with children whose curiosity often outstripped their grasp of history: ''They want to know if I was alive during slavery times. They equate me along with Harriet Tubman and Sojourner Truth and ask if I knew them.''         Correction:  October 26, 2005, Wednesday  Because of an editing error, a front-page obituary of Rosa Parks in late editions yesterday referred incorrectly to The Montgomery Advertiser, which printed a front-page article on Dec. 4, 1955, that publicized a boycott of Montgomery's buses the next day. It is a general-interest newspaper, not a black one.       
         Enid A. Haupt, whose philanthropy benefited libraries, museums and hospitals but who devoted much of her considerable fortune to creating public gardens and preserving horticultural institutions, died on Tuesday at her home in Greenwich, Conn. She was 99, and also kept a residence in Manhattan.         Her death was announced by her niece Cynthia Hazen Polsky.         Mrs. Haupt was fond of saying that ''nature is my religion.'' For more than five decades her greatest pleasure was sharing that religion.         A principal beneficiary of this passion was the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx. Over the years it received more than $34 million and will also receive a substantial gift from her estate. A major portion of her gift went to the resurrection of the garden's glass-domed Victorian conservatory, which by the 1970's had become a sodden and broken-paned ruin. The conservatory now bears her name.         ''People are refreshed, their minds are cleared, when they take a walk in a garden,'' she once said, explaining her interest in making public spaces beautiful. ''It's a marvelous escape from reality.''         Her other gifts were far-ranging and continuous. In the last 25 years alone they totaled more than $140 million, including $35 million to Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She also endowed 10 faculty positions and had been an active member of the cancer center's Board of Overseers. Other beneficiaries included the Enid A. Haupt Garden at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, four acres of Victorian formal gardens, a section of which is entered through nine-foot-high moon gates, and another area with North African accents. In 1993, Mrs. Haupt donated 15 works of art, valued at more than $5 million, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and, four years later, further works valued at $1.7 million, part of a total contribution of more than $13 million. A $1.5 million Haupt endowment maintains the gardens at the Cloisters in Upper Manhattan.         She also contributed $1 million to buy River Farm, a former home of George Washington in Alexandria, Va., for use as the national headquarters of the American Horticultural Society (with a stipulation that the 27 acres be open to the public). Another $1 million went to help the restoration of Bryant Park, adjoining the New York Public Library, once a haven for drug dealers and now a Midtown oasis. The library itself received more than $1.5 million, including $300,000 for a 1989 exhibition of flowers.         Mrs. Haupt's other important philanthropies included a multimillion-dollar gift to the Wildlife Conservation Society, some of which went to the restoration of Bronx Zoo Jungle World and some to an endowment fund for the project. She underwrote the Haupt Fountains on the Ellipse in Washington, between the White House and the Washington Monument. Other sizable contributions went to the restoration of the glass conservatory in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum and to the Enid A. Haupt Library Annex of the Horticultural Society of New York. There were also gifts to the Monet garden in Giverny, France, and the National Wildflower Research Center in Austin, Tex. A gift of Édouard Vuillard's ''Place Vintimille'' to the National Gallery of Art in Washington in 1998 was valued at $3.5 million.         A dreamer who was able to see many of her dreams take shape, she was also a realist, aware that even the best-laid plans require follow-up, and she devoted considerable time to the projects in which she took a particular interest. She was once asked how often the projects she supported ended up as she had visualized them. ''When they think I'll see it,'' she said.         Once committed to a project, she never wavered. When she wanted additional funds, she disposed of cherished possessions, seemingly without a qualm. Nineteen pieces from her collection of jewels brought more than $2 million at auction in the early 1970's. The money went immediately to her horticultural interests. In 1983, when she wanted $25 million to provide an ambulatory care center at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, she sold 15 of her French Impressionist paintings, including works by Gauguin, Cézanne, Renoir and van Gogh, to her brother, Walter H. Annenberg, the publisher, philanthropist and former ambassador to Britain. He died in 2002.         Mrs. Haupt was the fourth, and last surviving, of eight children of Sadie and Moses L. Annenberg, the publisher who founded Triangle Publications, whose holdings eventually included The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Philadelphia Daily News, The Daily Racing Form, TV Guide and radio and television stations. She was one of seven sisters, all of whom devoted much of their inherited wealth to public institutions.         Mrs. Haupt was married in 1936 to Ira Haupt, the founder and senior partner in a Wall Street securities concern, a marriage that lasted until Mr. Haupt's death in 1963. An earlier marriage to Norman Bensinger of Chicago, whom she had met while horseback riding, ended in divorce.         An intensely private woman -- Mrs. Haupt often wandered through the New York Botanical Garden when she felt there was little chance that she would be recognized -- she became less interested in the trappings of wealth as she grew older.         The gift that gave her the most satisfaction, she said, was one of her earliest and least heralded: the Enid A. Haupt Glass Garden, a playground for children who are patients at the Rusk Institute of Rehabilitation Medicine at New York University Medical Center. In 1959, she enveloped the playground, which was almost immediately nicknamed the Garden of Enid, in a greenhouse with soft music and made it a serene wheelchair-accessible haven for patients of every age and for staff members and visitors. Almost $1 million was donated for an endowment to maintain it.         Enid Annenberg was born in Chicago on May 13, 1906, and grew up in Milwaukee, where she attended the German-English Academy, now the University School. The family later moved to Manhattan and then to Long Island, but Enid was sent away to school at Mount Ida Seminary in Newton, Mass.         Although she was brought up at a time when careers for women from affluent families were not common, she was, she said, ''very adventurous and curious about everything and very different from my sisters.'' One of her first jobs was at The Philadelphia Inquirer, part of her father's publishing empire. During World War II, she wrote and broadcast for the Office of War Information, coining such phrases as ''If you can shell a pea, you can pack a parachute.''         In 1954, she became the publisher of Seventeen, the magazine for teenage girls, owned at the time by the Annenberg family. A year later, she became its editor, and for 15 years she directed the magazine from a pink swiveled throne in a large office dominated by pink curtains and pink flowers. During part of her tenure at the magazine, she also wrote a syndicated column, ''Young Living.''         She also wrote four books on young living and etiquette, with advice on how to meet boys and, once met, what to do about kissing. She recommended art exhibitions as a fine place to meet young men and once met, dropping a casual remark to capture their interest. Her suggestions of casual remarks included, ''What's chiaroscuro?'' and ''Picasso's Blue Period, I believe.''         If chiaroscuro or Picasso led to kissing, there was further advice: ''Kiss him lightly on the lips but don't go into a frantic clutch -- tilt your face ever so slightly so that the noses won't bump.''         Her serious collecting of Impressionist art began during her marriage to Mr. Haupt. ''My husband was also very interested and he supplied the money,'' she said.         She also made major gifts to museums. Six bronze sculptures by Giacometti, a sculpture by Henry Moore and a painting by Mark Rothko were among 13 pieces she gave to the National Gallery of Art in 1977.         She traced her interest in horticulture to a pot of huge purple orchids displayed in a friend's house in Milwaukee when she was a child. Much later, when a business associate of Mr. Haupt asked what she wanted as a wedding present, she said orchids, and orchids she got -- 13 tubs of cymbidiums from England.       
         Dorothy Wegman Raphaelson, who 80 years ago in chiffon, silk, feathers and lace floated across Jazz Age stages as a Ziegfeld Girl and went on to outlive all but one of her fellow dancers, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 100.         The cause was complications of a long-term heart ailment, her son, Joel Raphaelson, said.         The impresario Florenz Ziegfeld was inspired by the Paris revues he saw on a European trip in 1905 and opened his first Follies, a variety show with Rockette-like dancers, in 1907. The revues became a Broadway mainstay and ran in annual installments until Ziegfeld's death in 1932.         Amid the dancers and showgirls, he offered up entertainers like W. C. Fields, Fred Astaire and Bob Hope to audiences that included Diamond Jim Brady, who habitually put up $750 for 10 opening-night seats. Ziegfeld's mission of ''glorifying the American girl'' was heartily seconded by theatergoers, some of whom sent precious jewels ensconced in bouquets of roses to their favorites.         Mrs. Raphaelson not only played the part in the Ziegfeld Follies of the 20's but wrote about her experience in one of her two novels, ''Glorified,'' published in 1930. Ziegfeld himself contributed this to the book jacket: ''I wish every young girl who has aspirations to go on stage could read this honest and delightful story by one of the most charming of my own Follies Girls.''         Her audition: ''It was a lovely tune. One, two, three, one, two, three. I loved to dance! My legs seemed to loosen, my heart ceased its pounding.''         Her naïve reaction to being told a dancer was the mistress of a famous man: ''Were there any more in the show? Maybe? I gained a new interest in each girl, and scrutinized each one closely, looking for the unmistakable signs -- a mink coat and diamonds.''         The thrill of performing: ''It seemed I had been out there before the footlights but a second, a wonderful second, during which nothing existed but the dance and the music -- the thrilling music.''         Dorothy Deborah Wegman was born in Manhattan on Nov. 27, 1904, to immigrants from Eastern Europe, and grew up in Washington Heights. Her father was a civil engineer; according to an article in The New York World-Telegram in 1934, it was her mother who steered her daughter, at first reluctant, onto the stage.         Dorothy's father died when she was 14, and she left high school to support her mother and younger brother by sketching clothes for a coat and suit manufacturer.         She made her debut as a dancer in a Shubert revue, ''The Passing Show of 1921,'' at the Winter Garden Theater.         Ziegfeld divided dancers into ''shorts, mediums and talls,'' and Mrs. Raphaelson, then known as Dolly, was cast in the Follies of 1924 as a medium. She switched to her proper name, Dorothy, for that show. In 1927, while appearing in the Ziegfeld musical ''Rio Rita,'' she was given the diminutive Dorshka by Marion Benda, a well-known Ziegfeld beauty, and the name stuck.         During the run of ''Rio Rita,'' which The New York Times review said had ''inordinately beautiful dancing girls,'' she eloped with Samson Raphaelson, who wrote both the play and film versions of ''The Jazz Singer,'' as well as the short story on which they were based, among many other things.         After seven years with Ziegfeld, Mrs. Raphaelson took to domestic life ''like a bird to air,'' according to The World-Telegram. In later years, she acted in summer stock and published her second novel, ''Morning Song'' (1948). The couple lived successively in Hollywood; Bucks County, Pa.; and New York. Mr. Raphaelson died in 1983.         Doris Eaton Travis, 101, is now the sole surviving Ziegfeld Girl, according to Nils Hanson, administrator of the National Ziegfeld Club. In a telephone interview from her home in Norman, Okla., Mrs. Travis said that ''in a sense'' she felt suddenly lonely.         Mrs. Travis said she perfectly recalled her own audition for the Ziegfeld Follies in August 1918, becoming one of 3,000 chosen from the 15,000 women who tried out. She went from a ''special girl'' in 1919 to a full-fledged principal the next year to a solo performer in 1920.         ''It was beauty, elegance, loveliness,'' she said, ''beauty and elegance like a French painting of a woman's body.''         Mrs. Raphaelson is survived by her son, Joel, who lives in Chicago; her daughter, Naomi Yocum of Lancaster, Pa.; six grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.         Her long-term memories never dulled. One was of Al Jolson being protective of her when an off-color joke was told. ''Get your coat, Dorothy, you're going home,'' he ordered.         Another lay behind the inscription of her copy of Will Durant's ''Story of Philosophy.'' She had told a long-ago admirer to buy her the book rather than the diamond bracelet or fur wrap he offered.         ''For Dorothy,'' the inscription read. ''This was your idea, not mine.''         Correction:  November 18, 2005, Friday  An obituary on Saturday about Dorothy Wegman Raphaelson, a Ziegfeld girl, misidentified the author of the screenplay for the 1927 movie ''The Jazz Singer.'' The author was Alfred A. Cohn, who adapted it from a stage play by Samson Raphaelson (Mrs. Raphaelson's husband), not Mr. Raphaelson.       
         Ruth Clement Bond, an educator and civic leader who in the mid-1930's, in her first and only foray into quilt design, helped transform the American quilt from a utilitarian bedcovering into a work of avant-garde social commentary, died on Oct. 24 at her daughter's home in Manhattan. She was 101.         Her death was confirmed by her family.         Mrs. Bond was noted for a series of quilts known collectively as the T.V.A. quilts. Designed by her, the quilts were sewn in rural Alabama by the wives of African-American workers building dams there for the Tennessee Valley Authority. Visually arresting and contemporary-looking even today, the T.V.A. quilts are considered pivotal in the history of American quiltmaking.         While most quilts of the period were based on the traditional geometric and floral designs that had endured for more than a century, the T.V.A. quilts are dynamic works of modern art. Using solid-colored fabrics appliquéd onto stark backgrounds, they depict bold, stylized silhouettes of black people. With their jagged yet elegant lines, the figures have been compared to the paper cutouts of Matisse and to the work of the Harlem Renaissance painter Aaron Douglas.         Mrs. Bond, who had trained as an academic and did not know how to quilt, embarked on the project after her husband was sent to northern Alabama to supervise the black workers at the dam sites there. The Bonds lived for a time near the Wheeler Dam, in one of the segregated villages built for the workers and their families.         The women completed a half-dozen large quilts, all believed to have been made in 1934. Three are extant, as are several very small quilts, made as samples.         The T.V.A. quilts have been exhibited in New York at the Museum of Arts and Design, and elsewhere around the country. They are featured in several books, among them ''Soft Covers for Hard Times: Quiltmaking and the Great Depression'' (Rutledge Hill Press, 1990), by Merikay Waldvogel.         In later years, Mrs. Bond, whose husband joined the Foreign Service in 1944, taught at universities in Haiti, Liberia and Malawi and worked with women's and youth groups in Afghanistan, Tunisia and Sierra Leone. After returning to Washington in the 1960's, she served as president of the African-American Women's Association.         In 1978, Mrs. Bond was part of a fact-finding mission for the National Council of Negro Women that studied the role of women in Senegal, Togo and the Ivory Coast.         Ruth Elizabeth Clement was born in Louisville, Ky., on May 22, 1904, the fourth of seven children of a prominent black family. Her father, George, was a bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church. Her mother, the former Emma Williams, was, in 1946, the first black woman to be named American Mother of the Year.         Ruth received bachelor's and master's degrees in English literature from Northwestern University and was afterward the head of the English department at Kentucky State College.         In 1931, she married J. Max Bond and followed him to the University of Southern California, where he earned a doctorate in sociology. Mrs. Bond also started work on a Ph.D., but left after the birth of her first child. Mr. Bond later took a position with the T.V.A., becoming the highest-ranking black administrator there.         Mr. Bond died in 1991. Mrs. Bond is survived by their three children, Jane Clement Bond and J. Max Bond Jr., both of Manhattan, and George Clement Bond of Teaneck, N.J.; a sister, Emma Clement Walker, of Seattle; six grandchildren; and five great-grandchildren.         When Mrs. Bond joined her husband in Alabama, she planned to finish her doctoral studies, but there was no local university at which she could enroll. So, while her husband trained the builders, she went to work with their wives in the makeshift villages along the Tennessee River.         Many of the workers were former sharecroppers, and the dam project gave them their first real income. Almost overnight, their wives were buying pianos for their parlors. But to Mrs. Bond's consternation, they were wallpapering those parlors with the pages of the Sears catalog.         ''These country women were buying things they didn't need, yet weren't fixing up their houses,'' she said in 1992, in an oral history for the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training.         Mrs. Bond started a home beautification program, helping the women make curtains from dyed feed sacks and rugs from cornhusks. Many of the women were expert quilters, and she began designing pictorial quilts that celebrated black Americans' expanded opportunities under the New Deal. Mrs. Bond cut the pattern pieces out of paper and chose the colors; the women pieced and quilted the cotton fabric.         One quilt depicts a man torn between an alluring woman, tantalizingly glimpsed at one edge of the image, and a solid government job, represented by an extended uniformed arm, at the other.         Another shows a black fist seeming to rise straight from the earth. The fist clutches a jagged red lightning bolt, symbolizing the T.V.A.'s promise of rural electrification.         The women called the quilt ''Black Power.''       
         R. Gaynor McCown, the executive director of the Teaching Commission, a bipartisan advocacy group of leaders in business, government, philanthropy and education, died on Monday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 45.         Her death was announced by the group's founder and chairman, Louis V. Gerstner Jr., a former chairman of the I.B.M. Corporation. The cause was bile duct cancer, the commission said.         Ms. McCown joined the group in 2002 to direct its reform agenda for the teaching profession, with goals including linking pay with performance and overhauling training, recruitment and support. She was a principal author of its report, ''Teaching at Risk,'' published last year.         Rosemary Gaynor McCown was born in Mobile, Ala., and graduated from St. Mary's College in Notre Dame, Ind., in 1983. She received a master's degree from the Harvard University Graduate School of Education in 1987 and taught high school science and health classes in the Bronx for five years.         In the 1990's, she was a White House Fellow and a senior executive with the New York City Partnership. After receiving a master's in business administration in 2000, she was the senior vice president for business development at Edison Schools, an operator of commercial charter schools, when Mr. Gerstner recruited her for the Teaching Commission.         She was a trustee of the Center for Employment Opportunities and a director of New York City Outward Bound.         Ms. McCown is survived by her husband, Jonathan D. Miller; two brothers, John D. Jr., of Pound Ridge, N.Y., and James M., of Somerville, Mass.; and two sisters, Eugenia H. McCown of Fairhope, Ala., and Robin M. Mumford of Chicago.       
         Dorothy Law Nolte, a writer and family counselor whose ubiquitous inspirational poem, ''Children Learn What They Live,'' was photocopied, circulated, anthologized and affixed to refrigerator doors worldwide for nearly two decades before she claimed rightful authorship of it in the 1970's, died on Nov. 6 at her home in Rancho Santa Margarita, Calif. She was 81.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         In 1954, Mrs. Nolte, who wrote a weekly column on family matters for The Torrance Herald, a local newspaper, found herself on deadline and strapped for material. She composed a 14-line poem on childrearing that would become a mantra for millions of parents.         The poem quickly took on a life of its own. It was copied repeatedly and passed from hand to hand. It was printed on plaques and posters. It was distributed to millions of new parents by a maker of baby formula.         Earlier this year, Crown Prince Naruhito of Japan announced that he would raise his daughter, Princess Aiko, by its tenets.         For years, the poem was widely believed to be anonymous, and Mrs. Nolte received neither credit nor compensation. Unaware that she had loosed a genie on the world, she soon forgot about it.         In 1972, after discovering how big her poem had become, Mrs. Nolte copyrighted it. In 1998, she expanded it into a book, ''Children Learn What They Live: Parenting to Inspire Values,'' written with Rachel Harris. The book has more than 3 million copies in print worldwide and has been translated into 18 languages, according to its publisher, Workman Publishing.         Mrs. Nolte and Ms. Harris also collaborated on a sequel, ''Teenagers Learn What They Live: Parenting to Inspire Integrity and Independence,'' published by Workman in 2002.         Considered timeless wisdom by some and undiluted treacle by others, Mrs. Nolte's poem is organized as a series of logical propositions:         If children live with criticism, they learn to condemn.         If children live with hostility, they learn to fight.         If children live with fear, they learn to be apprehensive.         If children live with pity, they learn to feel sorry for themselves.         But do not despair, the poem seems to say. It continues:         If children live with encouragement, they learn confidence.         If children live with tolerance, they learn patience.         If children live with praise, they learn appreciation.         If children live with acceptance, they learn to love.         The poem has time-honored antecedents in Western oral tradition. With its steady rhythm and gentle didacticism, it recalls well-loved nursery rhymes or ballads. As with much oral literature that is later written down, it circulated in a number of variant texts over the years, some longer, some shorter, some with altered language.         Mrs. Nolte herself changed the poem in later years to make it gender-neutral. (The original read, ''If a child lives with criticism, he learns to condemn,'' and so on.)         Dorothy Louise McDaniel was born in Los Angeles on Jan. 12, 1924. She held various jobs before training as a family counselor in the 1950's. In recent years, she lectured often on childrearing.         Mrs. Nolte's first marriage, to Durwood Law, ended in divorce. She married Claude Nolte in 1959. With her second husband, Mrs. Nolte wrote a book, ''Wake Up in Bed, Together! A Handbook for Sexual Repatterning'' (Stein & Day, 1975).         Mr. Nolte died in 1988. Mrs. Nolte is survived by two children from her first marriage, Joyce Jameson of Gold Canyon, Ariz., and Gerald Law of Rancho Santa Margarita; a daughter from her second marriage, Lisa Mulvania, of Huntington Beach, Calif.; a stepson, David Nolte, of Kailua, Hawaii; eight grandchildren; six great-grandchildren; and one great-great-grandchild.       
         Constance Cummings, a versatile American actress who lived mostly in England and, in a more glamorous age of liners and ocean crossings, captivated audiences on both sides of the Atlantic in a long stage, screen and television career, died on Wednesday in a nursing home in Oxfordshire. She was 95.         Her death was confirmed by her son, Dr. Jonathan Levy.         Starting as a teenage chorus girl in New York in 1928, Ms. Cummings appeared in several Broadway shows, caught the eye of a Hollywood mogul in 1930 and was soon playing flappers, molls and ingénues in a skein of films heavy on romance, blazing guns and sedans careening along dark roads.         From that inauspicious apprenticeship, she climbed on rungs of talent and drive to become a serious and celebrated actress in New York and London. She took on plays by Shakespeare, Sartre, Shaw, Edward Albee, Tennessee Williams and others, and with them more complex roles: vulgar women, ambitious schemers, witless socialites and victims of drugs, alcohol and stroke.         Ms. Cummings's finest performance, many critics said, was as Mary Tyrone, the frail matriarch of an Irish-American family, in the 1971 London revival of ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' Eugene O'Neill's autobiographical tale of a dysfunctional family's day of disintegration.         Playing opposite Laurence Olivier at the National Theater, Ms. Cummings delivered a subtle and hypnotic portrayal of transformation, from a gentle maternal presence to the spectral morphine addict of the last act. Clive Barnes, in a review for The New York Times, called it ''one of the most compelling O'Neill productions I have ever seen -- terrifying in its intensity and uncompromising honesty.''         In the 1979 Broadway production of Arthur Kopit's ''Wings,'' Ms. Cummings bewitched theatergoers in the role she called the most demanding of her career: Emily Stilson, a one-time aviator and wing-walker, stricken by a cerebral hemorrhage and groping in the chaotic landscape of her broken mind.         To be in the audience, critics said, was to be inside her consciousness, lost in the silent pandemonium of the stroke. A ticking clock falters, then stops. The lamp flickers out. She sits alone in the darkness, bewildered by jumbled memories, terrifying voices. Have I crashed in a strange country? Are the doctors Romanians? Why are they talking gibberish? Why can't they understand my perfectly lucid answers? Is this a snowstorm? What is a toothbrush? Who am I?         Richard Eder, in a review for The Times, called her performance ''by far the most distinguished work to open on Broadway this season.'' Ms. Cummings shared the Tony award for best actress that year with Carole Shelley, who was cited for her role in ''The Elephant Man.''         Ms. Cummings made more than 40 American and British films, most of them in the 1930's and 40's -- a canon of romantic comedies, farces and potboilers co-starring the likes of Harold Lloyd, George Raft, Robert Young and Spencer Tracy. It was her 1945 role in the screen adaptation of Noël Coward's ''Blithe Spirit,'' with Rex Harrison, that made her an international star.         But as her dramatic range widened, she became better known for her perishable stage work than her film roles. In the 1950's and 60's, she made only eight movies, but performed in scores of plays on Broadway, in the West End and at the National Theater in London, and elsewhere in Britain and Europe.         In London, she was in Joseph Kramm's ''Shrike'' (1953), with Sam Wanamaker; Clifford Odets's ''Winter Journey'' (1952), with Michael Redgrave; Aristophanes' ''Lysistrata'' (1957); Sartre's ''Huis Clos'' (''No Exit,'' 1962); Max Beerbohm's ''Social Success'' (1962); and as Martha, the alcoholic campus wife, in Albee's ''Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?'' (1964).         In her twilight years, Ms. Cummings appeared in revivals of ''The Chalk Garden'' in New York and ''Mrs. Warren's Profession'' in Vienna, both in 1982; in a 1983 television version of ''Wings,'' filmed for the American Playhouse series on PBS; and in a London production of ''The Glass Menagerie'' in 1985. Her last television movie was ''Dead Man's Folly,'' an Agatha Christie mystery with Peter Ustinov as Hercule Poirot, on CBS in 1986. Her West End finale was in ''Uncle Vanya,'' in 1999.         Constance Cummings was born Constance Halverstadt -- she took her mother's maiden name professionally -- in Seattle on May 15, 1910, the daughter of a lawyer and a concert soprano. She was stage-struck early, studied classical dancing and performed in summer stock at 16. Two years later, accompanied by her mother, she went to New York, where she got into the chorus line of a Broadway musical.         By 1930, she had caught the eye of Samuel Goldwyn, and went to Hollywood to co-star with Ronald Coleman in ''The Devil to Pay.'' Unexpectedly replaced by Loretta Young, she jumped to Columbia and made her first film, ''The Criminal Code,'' in 1931, with Walter Huston. She appeared in 21 more movies over the next four years, most notably ''Movie Crazy,'' with Harold Lloyd.         In Hollywood, she met the British playwright and director Benn W. Levy, who was there to do a script. They were married in 1933 and settled in London a year later. She had to win a court fight with Columbia to make movies in Britain. But by 1935, she was one of the most sought after film stars on either side of the Atlantic. She also began appearing on the stage again, in London and New York.         Many of her plays in the 1940's and 50's were written or directed by her husband, who became a Labor member of Parliament after World War II and a prominent campaigner for nuclear disarmament.         In her heyday, Ms. Cummings cut a glamorous figure, a gray-eyed, auburn-haired beauty toasted in Hollywood, New York and London. Her trans-Atlantic sailings made little items in the newspapers.         In 1974, Ms. Cummings was named a Commander of the British Empire for her contributions to entertainment. She had spent so many years in England -- living in London and on a 600-acre farm in Oxfordshire -- and spoke British English with so slight an accent that many Americans assumed she was British. Her husband died in 1973. In addition to her son, she is survived by a daughter, Jemima Levy. Both live in Oxford.         Correction:  November 30, 2005, Wednesday  An obituary yesterday about Constance Cummings, a stage and screen actress, misspelled the surname of the co-star of the film ''The Devil to Pay!'' (1930), in which she was replaced by Loretta Young. He was Ronald Colman, not Coleman.       
         Hermine Braunsteiner Ryan was a Queens homemaker in 1964 when The New York Times revealed her notorious past as a vicious Nazi death camp guard.         Nearly a decade later, she became the first United States citizen to be extradited for war crimes. She was sent to West Germany, where she was tried, convicted and sentenced to life in prison.         That was in 1981, and little has been written about her since, although a German newspaper took note of her release, for health reasons, in 1996.         It turns out that she died three years later, on April 19, 1999, at the age of 79.         Her death appears to have gone unrecorded by American newspapers and magazines, although it is noted on the Internet encyclopedia Wikipedia and in a footnote in a 2005 memoir, ''Omaha Blues,'' by Joseph Lelyveld, a former executive editor of The Times, who recounts his experience as the young reporter who knocked on the door of the Ryan home more than 40 years ago.         Official word of Mrs. Ryan's death came in recent weeks from the Simon Wiesenthal Center's office in Israel, in response to questions by another Times reporter who was researching an article on the former Maidanek death camp in Poland, where Mrs. Ryan was once assigned.         Efraim Zuroff, director of the Israeli center, said he believed the death had been noted in some German papers. He said he did not know the cause, but in 1996, when the German government pardoned her from her life sentence, she suffered from diabetes and had had a leg amputated.         Dr. Zuroff said Mrs. Ryan's extradition and conviction were among the few successful legal actions against Nazis in the United States before the Justice Department Office of Special Investigations was established in 1979.         At the time she was discovered, Mrs. Ryan was living as the wife of an electrical construction worker in Maspeth, where she was known for her scrupulous housecleaning and friendly manner. When she was fighting deportation in 1972, The Times quoted neighbors saying her gruesome past was impossible for them to believe.         Survivors of the Maidanek concentration and death camp, near Lublin, told of her whipping women to death, seizing children by the hair and throwing them on trucks to take them to the gas chamber, kicking away a stool to hang a young girl, and stomping old women to death with her jackboots, among other cruelties. Her nickname was the Stomping Mare.         In her five-and-a-half-year trial by a West German court, which ended in mid-1981, Mrs. Ryan was convicted of just two murders. The deaths of possible witnesses and fading memories may have weakened the prosecution's case on other counts. Also, rules limited convictions to individual crimes actually witnessed.         Hermine Braunsteiner was born in Vienna on July 16, 1919. Her father was a butcher and not involved in politics. She received a strict Roman Catholic education and first wanted to be a nurse.         She instead worked in a brewery and as a household servant before going to work at the Heinkel Aircraft Works in Berlin, where she adopted the Nazi ideology. She applied to work at the Ravensbrück women's concentration camp in part to get more pay, starting in 1939.         In October 1942, she was transferred to Maidanek and promoted to assistant warden. She became known for whipping women for not sewing on their prison numbers correctly.         In 1944 she was sent back to Ravensbrück to lead a work detail. She had risen to supervising warden when the Soviet Army approached the camp. She fled to Vienna before the Soviet soldiers liberated the camp on July 23, 1944.         In 1946, she was arrested in Austria and handed over to Allied authorities, who shuffled her between internment and prisoner-of-war camps. In 1949 Austrian authorities again arrested her, and this time tried her.         She was convicted of assassination, infanticide and manslaughter at Ravensbrück in 1941 and 1942. Maidanek was barely mentioned.         Mrs. Ryan was sentenced to three years in prison, but was released early, in 1950. The Austrian government promised not to charge her with any additional crimes and granted her amnesty.         She then worked at hotels and restaurants, and met Russell Ryan, described in various sources as an American soldier or an American construction worker in Germany. In 1958, they moved to Nova Scotia, marrying in October of that year.         In April 1959, they moved to Queens, and she became an American citizen in January 1963.         Simon Wiesenthal, the Nazi hunter, who died in September, wrote in ''Justice Not Vengeance'' (1989) that he was approached in January 1964 in the Cafe Royal in Tel Aviv by three survivors of Maidanek. They told him about the cruel guard called Kobyla, the Polish word for mare.         One of his aides went to Vienna and discovered from her friends that she was in Halifax. Mr. Wiesenthal learned from a friend in Toronto that she had moved to Queens and got the address. The Nazi hunter then told the Vienna correspondent of The Times this information.         Mr. Lelyveld, as a young reporter, was assigned to check out the tip, but wrote that he was not given a specific address. He knocked on many doors of Queens residents with the last name Ryan.         On July 14, 1964, Mr. Lelyveld wrote that Mrs. Ryan readily acknowledged that she was Hermine Braunsteiner of Maidanek. She protested that she had already been punished in Austria, and said she was sick in the infirmary for much of the time she was assigned to Maidanek. Her husband told the reporter that he did not know she was a prison guard until Mr. Lelyveld informed him.         ''This is the end of everything for me,'' Mrs. Ryan said.         In 1971, she was stripped of her citizenship because she had concealed her criminal conviction from American immigration authorities. Germany and Poland then applied for her extradition.         She feared going to Poland, but said she was agreeable to going to West Germany. In August 1973, Mrs. Ryan was expelled from the United States. Her trial in Düsseldorf began in November 1975. With the many witnesses and procedural delays, it did not end until mid-1981.         Mr. Lelyveld wrote that in prison, Mrs. Ryan refused to speak to other inmates and liked to sew dolls and soft toys. When she was released, she went to a nursing home in Bochum-Linden where her husband lived.         A German weekly, Süddeutsche Zeitung Magazin, wrote of the couple in 1996, saying he had been seen pushing her through the market in a wheelchair, and asking her if she would like a bouquet of flowers. She did not respond. He looked at his watch and pushed on. Nothing is known of him now.         Correction:  December 10, 2005, Saturday  An article on the obituary page on Dec. 2 about Hermine Braunsteiner Ryan, a Queens homemaker who had once been a Nazi death camp guard, referred incompletely to the coverage of her death, in 1999. Although her death appears to have gone unrecorded at the time in the United States, it was noted in passing by some newspapers -- including The Daily News and Newsday -- in their obituary coverage, in September, of Simon Wiesenthal, the Nazi hunter who tracked her down.       
         Katharine Sergava, a dancer and actress who portrayed Laurey in Agnes de Mille's dream ballet in the original Broadway production of ''Oklahoma!,'' died on Nov. 26 at her home in Manhattan. She was 95 or 96.         Her death was reported yesterday by a longtime friend, Ann Berlin. An erroneous report of Ms. Sergava's death appeared in The New York Times on Dec. 4, 2003.         Ms. Sergava was born in Tiflis (now Tblisi) in Georgia on July 30, 1909 or 1910 (she gave both dates). She fled Russia with her family during the Revolution and settled for a time in London. She studied drama and ballet in London and Paris and later emigrated to the United States.         In New York, she danced with the Mordkin Ballet, Ballet Theater, now known as American Ballet Theater, and the Original Ballet Russe, as Col. W. de Basil's Ballet Russe then called itself.         She danced the part of Laurey from the opening of ''Oklahoma!'' in 1943 until 1947. She was then cast in ''Look Ma, I'm Dancing,'' choreographed by Jerome Robbins. In 1956, she took over Lotte Lenya's role in ''The Threepenny Opera.''         She also appeared in a variety of plays, including ''Dial M for Murder'' and Jean Cocteau's ''The Typewriter,'' and she toured in Shaw's ''Misalliance.'' She taught drama at HB Studios in New York for more than 30 years.         Her husband, Bernard Sznycer, died in 1970. She leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Rona Jaffe, the preternaturally youthful writer whose 1958 novel ''The Best of Everything'' told the melodramatic story of four nubile, cashmere-sweatered career girls torn between storybook romance and cutthroat corporate Manhattan, died yesterday at University College Hospital in London, where she was on vacation. She was 74.         She died of cancer, said Alan C. Rothfeld, her lawyer and longtime friend.         Essentially commissioned by the movie producer Jerry Wald, Ms. Jaffe was a 25-year-old former associate editor in publishing when she sat down to write a book that Mr. Wald could turn into a blockbuster feature like ''Kitty Foyle: The Natural History of a Woman,'' a 1940 film that won Ginger Rogers an Academy Award for playing a plucky working girl who finds love, heartache, an unwanted pregnancy and, finally, romantic redemption. Published by Simon & Schuster, ''The Best of Everything,'' which drew on Ms. Jaffe's four-year employment at Fawcett Publications, as well as the experiences of close friends, was the urban answer to ''Peyton Place,'' Grace Metalious's risqué novel of lust in small-town America, which had been published two years earlier.         Ms. Jaffe's beautiful heroines -- Caroline, April, Barbara and Gregg -- toil as stenographers but are distracted by men, most of them cads, not to mention a lecherous boss called Mr. Shalimar. As Martin Levin of The New York Times wrote in a review of the book: ''Before very many coffee breaks one is a stretcher case, one is pregnant and the third is off to Las Vegas with a notorious lounge lizard. But that's the life of a working girl, at least as seen through Miss Jaffe's wide eyes.''         Critics howled, but America was entranced, which is precisely what its editor, Robert Gottlieb, was sure would happen. ''It was a basic story -- three or four or five girls start off together, one finds love, one goes crazy and/or dies, and one of them becomes a huge success -- but Rona's take was very up-to-date,'' Mr. Gottlieb said last night in a telephone interview. ''What made it work for the time was that it had a fresh young-career-women-in-New York quality with a fillip of shock.''         The synergy of its canny packaging as a book written expressly for Hollywood production was equally shocking at the time. Within two weeks of publication, the book was on the New York Times best-seller list, where it stayed for five months.         Less than a year later, thanks to Jerry Wald's involvement, ''The Best of Everything'' was released as a chic but heavy-handed film by 20th Century Fox and the director Jean Negulesco. The heroines' work site, Fabian Publishing, was set in the brand-new Seagram Building, and some of the sets were designed in seeming homage to a hot New York society decorator of the moment, Michael Greer. In a review of the movie's release on DVD last summer, Amy Nicholson of the Web site digsmagazine.com described its melodramatic, nail-biting charms as best accompanied by ''bonbons, chilled blush wine and possibly an emergency hanky.''         Hope Lange, Diane Baker, Martha Hyer and the 1950's supermodel Suzy Parker starred as the young women about town. Joan Crawford made a special appearance as Amanda Farrow, an ill-tempered book editor who, the film makes pointedly clear, has sacrificed personal happiness for professional glory. But it was Ms. Jaffe who went in a relative nobody and came back a star.         Born in 1931 in Brooklyn, Ms. Jaffe grew up in posh circumstances on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, the only child of Samuel Jaffe, an elementary-school principal, and his first wife, Diana, a high-strung socialite who had an independent fortune and a suburban estate in Connecticut. Her maternal grandfather was Moses Ginsberg, a millionaire construction magnate who built the Carlyle hotel.         Unlike her rather passive fictional characters, however, the tough-talking Ms. Jaffe was professionally ambitious and openly spoke of her desire to be a success. After graduating from the Dalton School at 15 and Radcliffe College four years later, she became a file clerk at Fawcett, eventually becoming an associate editor before leaving to write ''The Best of Everything.''         Like many of her characters, she had numerous romantic adventures, including a relationship with an Astor real estate heir. Ms. Jaffe did not, however, ever marry, preferring to avoid what she once dismissively described as ''the rat race to the altar.'' She leaves no survivors.         In the decades that followed ''The Best of Everything,'' Ms. Jaffe wrote 15 more popular books, several of which used the quartet-of-women narrative approach, including ''The Last Chance,'' a 1976 novel that one reviewer described as ''best devoured alone in bed, with a container of yogurt,'' and ''Class Reunion,'' a sudsy 1979 novel about three decades in the lives of four Radcliffe classmates, one of whom has a gay husband. Her last book was ''The Room-Mating Season,'' published in 2003. Mr. Gottlieb said he believed that her finest work was ''Mr. Right Is Dead,'' a 1965 collection of short stories and the title novella, about a call girl.         In her later years, Ms. Jaffe established herself as a patron of the arts. In 1995, she established the Rona Jaffe Foundation, which provides grants to emerging female writers. ''All writers need support, but many women in early career have fewer resources available to them and often many demands made upon them,'' Ms. Jaffe said in September at an awards ceremony. ''It gives me great pleasure to help some of them make their way at this early stage.''       
         Constance L. Hays, a reporter for The New York Times for nearly two decades, died on Monday at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx. She was 44 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was cancer, her husband, John Hays, said.         Ms. Hays, who joined The Times in 1986, covered business news for the last eight years, writing on subjects from magazine publishing to the food and beverage industry to advertising.         Most recently, she covered Martha Stewart's trial and conviction on charges of lying to federal investigators about a stock sale.         Ms. Hays also wrote ''The Real Thing: Truth and Power at the Coca-Cola Company'' (Random House, 2004). Reviewing the book in The Times, Rosabeth Moss Kanter called it a ''gripping account,'' adding that Ms. Hays ''has a novelist's flair for conveying her characters' thoughts and evoking the sights and sounds of her settings.''         Constance Mary Laibe was born in Manhattan on Aug. 8, 1961, the daughter of John Laibe and the former Ann Davis. She grew up in Greenwich, Conn., and in Hong Kong, where her father was an executive with the Exxon Chemical Company.         Returning to the United States, she graduated from Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., and in 1983 received a bachelor's degree in Asian studies from Harvard. She married Mr. Hays in 1986.         Ms. Hays began her career as a reporter for The News and Observer in Raleigh, N.C., before joining The Times as a news clerk. She was later a reporter on the paper's metropolitan news staff.         Ms. Hays is survived by her husband, the deputy chairman of Christie's auction house; their three children, Sophie, John and Henry; her parents, of Greenwich; and four siblings, Anne Bertolino of Boxborough, Mass.; Marc Laibe of Rowayton, Conn.; Christopher Laibe of New Orleans; and Timothy Laibe of Bedford, N.H.       
         Margretta Madden Styles, a nursing educator who conceived and helped establish precise national standards for certifying nurses in pediatrics, cardiology and other medical specialties, died on Nov. 20 at her home in Clearwater, Fla. She was 75.         The cause was colon cancer, her family said.         It was in the 1970's that Dr. Styles and others began to press for stricter certification of nurses and a rational system to regulate them. She lectured and wrote on the subject in nursing journals, contributing articles on advanced nursing practices and ways to determine criteria for issuing sound credentials.         In the 1980's she helped found the American Nurses Credentialing Center, which now administers testing for more than 20 medical specialties and, said Catherine L. Gilliss, dean of the Duke University School of Nursing, ''helped to standardize across the nation just what to expect from your nurse.''         The center is the credentialing arm of the American Nurses Association, which represents 150,000 nurses and nurse specialists. Dr. Styles served as the association's president from 1986 to 1988.         Later in her career she studied the emerging importance of trained nurses in developing countries and, in 1993, was elected president of the International Council of Nurses.         She continued to write on certification and helped edit a popular anthology, ''On Nursing: A Literary Celebration'' (1993), which ''framed the art of healing, the pain of suffering, and was received as a gift to the profession,'' said Barbara A. Blakeney, the current president of the American Nurses Association.         Margretta Madden was born in Mount Union, Pa., and earned an undergraduate degree from Juniata College, a master's from Yale and a doctorate in education from the University of Florida.         She worked as a staff nurse in hospitals before becoming an associate professor of nursing at Duke in 1967. She was dean of nursing at the University of Texas at San Antonio; then at Wayne State University, in Detroit; and finally at the University of California, San Francisco.         Dr. Styles's husband of 47 years, the Rev. Douglas Styles, an Episcopal priest, died in 2002.         She is survived by two sons, Michael, of St. Petersburg, Fla., and Patrick, of Redmond, Wash.; a daughter, Megan Styles of Danville, Calif.; a brother, Joseph Madden of Indian Rocks, Fla.; a sister, Jane Rupp of St. Petersburg; and two grandchildren.       
         Mary Aiken Littauer, whose love affair with horses began with a childhood pony, blossomed with her marriage to an officer in the cavalry of Czar Nicholas II, and flowered famously when she became a leading expert on horses of ancient times, died on Dec. 7 at her home in Syosset, N.Y. She was 93.         Her son, Andrew, announced the death.         Mrs. Littauer's scholarly career did not begin until her mid-50's, when her husband's health would no longer permit him to maintain his standards of horsemanship. The standards were high indeed: Vladimir S. Littauer was the author of eight books on riding and training horses, and his instructional techniques are still used.         Not wanting to ride alone, Mrs. Littauer was restless. Her husband suggested she write a book about horses.         She had had no college education, but decided to start at the beginning. By bringing her keen intelligence and considerable horse sense to archaeological discoveries, she would write about when and how horses and men got together. Her first article, ''The Function of the Yoke Saddle in Ancient Harnessing,'' appeared in the British journal Antiquity in 1968.         The same year, Mrs. Littauer was introduced to Joost Crouwel, who had just earned a degree in classical archaeology from the University of Amsterdam and was beginning his doctoral thesis on Mycenaean chariots. A collaboration of three decades began.         Dr. Crouwel became professor of Aegean archaeology at the University of Amsterdam. Mrs. Littauer gained fame as the Grande Dame of the study of horses.         The two wrote about 65 articles for academic journals, usually with each other though sometimes with other scholars and sometimes individually. A typical title: ''The Earliest Evidence for Metal Bridle Parts.''         They wrote two books, ''Wheeled Vehicles and Ridden Animals in the Ancient Near East'' (1970) and ''Chariots and Related Equipment from the Tomb of Tutankhamen'' (1985). Both became standard reference works.         ''They have set international standards that will last for many years,'' said Peter Raulvig, an archaeologist and linguist who also studied chariots.         In 2002, Mrs. Littauer and Dr. Crouwel published a collection titled ''Selected Writing on Chariots and Other Early Vehicles, Riding and Harness.''         An example of Mrs. Littauer's analysis was her article in 1983 in La Recherche, a French counterpart of Scientific American, in which she rejected earlier assertions that the first wheels were used on two-wheeled carts. Instead, she argued, the first real wheel was on a crude four-wheel vehicle. She theorized that soft sands in the Middle East would have made a two-wheeled precursor of the chariot impractical, and pointed to the four-wheeled carriages discovered by Sir Leonard Woolley in the so-called King's Tomb in Ur, a Sumerian city that flourished in Lower Mesopotamia (now Iraq) about 4,500 years ago.         But she disputed Sir Leonard's contention that the vehicles were the ''tanks'' of antiquity. The reason was that the harness used was highly vulnerable to projectiles, not to mention the vehicle's occupants, The New York Times reported in 1983.         Her ability to interpret evidence found by others became legendary. She once pointed out that an ancient horse's bit displayed in the British Museum was upside down. Embarrassed curators corrected the error.         Mary Aiken Graver was born in Pittsburgh on Feb. 11, 1912, and grew up in Manhattan. Her formal education ended when she graduated from what is now the Spence School. Her interest in horses dates from her ownership of a cow pony in Nevada, where her family vacationed.         As a young woman, she was a volunteer courier in the Frontier Nursing Service, which provided health care in rural Kentucky. For young society women, the chance to ride horses for many miles over roadless, mountainous terrain in a good cause was grand adventure. She was once caught in the middle of a shooting battle between feuding families.         Mr. Littauer founded a riding academy called the Boots and Saddles Club, and also taught private clients at the family's Long Island home before his death in 1989, at 96. In addition to their son, of Princeton, N.J., Mrs. Littauer is survived by two grandsons.         Already fluent in French, Mrs. Littauer taught herself ancient Greek, German and Russian. Scholars sent her their research results, commentaries and papers to edit.         Mary B. Moore, an art historian at Hunter College specializing in ancient Greece, said that Mrs. Littauer advised colleagues on how an ancient bit or bridle was probably used, or on where the driver would have stood on a chariot. Dr. Moore said those suggestions were utterly practical, and seldom theoretical or aesthetic.         She said that Mrs. Littauer seldom went to archaeological digs, because of her age. ''Sitting around a ditch all day wouldn't have been one of those things she would go for.''         She was nonetheless famously observant. In a paper on the Roman use of horses, Judith A. Walker, an archaeologist, mentioned a chariot and harness found in an ancient tomb.         ''No one person has spent more time studying, reconstructing and analyzing this harness and chariot than Mary Littauer,'' she wrote.         Mrs. Littauer embodied skepticism, as when what appeared to be wheels of chariots were found on the Russian steppes. In an article in The New York Times in 1994, she cautioned, ''A spoked wheel is not necessarily a chariot, only a light car on the way to becoming a chariot.''         On rare occasions, Mrs. Littauer ventured beyond the ancient world, with an interest as modern as the horses of medieval knights.       
         Margaret Hodges, who filled bookshelves with retold legends and other books for young readers and with the awards she received for them, died on Tuesday at her home in Verona, Pa. She was 94.         Her death was announced by her son Arthur C. Hodges, who said two more of her books were to be published in the future.         Her most recent illustrated books of familiar stories include ''Merlin and the Making of the King'' (Holiday House, 2004), ''The Wee Christmas Cabin'' (Holiday House, early 2007) and ''Moses'' (Harcourt Brace, January 2007).         Mrs. Hodges's other books still in print include ''The Wave'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1964), adapted from Lafcadio Hearn's ''Gleanings in Buddha-Fields;'' ''Saint George and the Dragon: A Golden Legend'' (Little, Brown, 1984), adapted from Spenser's ''Faerie Queen;'' ''The Kitchen Knight: A Tale of King Arthur'' (Holiday House, 1990); ''Saint Patrick and the Peddler'' (Orchard Books, 1993); ''Gulliver in Lilliput'' (Holiday House, 1995); ''Molly Limbo'' (Atheneum, 1996); and ''Up the Chimney'' (Holiday House, 1998).         She wrote more than 50 books over 47 years. She edited other work, especially travel books for young people, before writing her first book, ''One Little Drum'' (Follet Publishing Company, 1958). Aimed at children 6 to 9 years old, it was based on the exploits of her own three sons.         Mrs. Hodges also wrote biographies and novels for children and young adults.         She was born Sarah Margaret Moore on July 26, 1911, in Indianapolis and graduated from Vassar in 1932, the year she married Fletcher Hodges Jr., a museum curator. She also received a master's degree in library science in 1958 from the Carnegie Institute of Technology while working as a volunteer children's librarian at the Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. She later was a story specialist for the Pittsburgh Public Schools and joined the faculty of the University of Pittsburgh School of Information Sciences, from which she retired as a professor emerita in 1978.         While in Pittsburgh, she was a storyteller on the show ''Tell Me a Story'' on WQED-TV, a public television station, from the mid-1960's to 1976.         Mrs. Hodges earned numerous literary honors, including the Caldecott Medal of the American Library Association in 1985 for ''Saint George and the Dragon.''         Besides her husband of 73 years, and her son Arthur, of Essex, Mass., Mrs. Hodges is survived by two more sons, Fletcher III, of Manhattan, and John A., of Washington; 9 grandchildren; and 10 great-grandchildren.
