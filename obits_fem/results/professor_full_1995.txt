         Reva Rubin, who was among the first specialists in maternity nursing, died on Saturday at her home in Harrisville, Pa. She was 76 and also lived in Panama City, Fla.         The cause was a heart attack, said officials at the University of Pittsburgh, where Professor Rubin had taught for 21 years before retiring in 1981.         In scores of case studies she observed and documented as a nurse, midwife and teacher, she examined how mothers use a variety of senses -- sight, smell and touch -- to become familiar with their newborns.  To encourage the bonding that she observed, she was an early proponent of keeping the mother and the newborn together as much as possible during the first days after birth.         By the 1980's, the concept that there is a special time right after birth during which mothers become emotionally attached to their babies began to receive criticism from some researchers, although the changes in hospital practice that the research wrought were never questioned.         She was the author of "The Maternal Identity and the Maternal Experience" (Springer, 1984). In 1972, she was a founder with her companion and longtime professional colleague, Dr. Florence H. Erickson of the Maternal Child Care Nursing Journal, the first research journal in the field. Together, they also established master's and doctoral programs in nursing at the University of Pittsburgh.         A graduate of Hunter College in 1941, she went on to Yale to receive master's degrees in nursing in 1946 and in mental health in 1954. She taught at Yale and the University of Chicago before joining the University of Pittsburgh in 1960.         Besides Dr. Erickson of Harrisville, she is survived by a brother, Harry, of Cape Coral, Fla.       
         Dr. Janine Andre-Schwartz, an immunologist and specialist in electron microscopy, died on April 26 at New England Medical Center in Boston. She was 62 and lived in Brookline, Mass.         The cause was cancer, said a spokeswoman at the center, where she was a medical researcher in the division of hematology/oncology.         Dr. Andre-Schwartz was also an associate professor of medicine at Tufts University School of Medicine. She had been on the staff of both institutions for 26 years. Working with the electron microscope, she contributed to research on immunological disease.         Dr. Andre-Schwartz did much of her research in collaboration with her husband, Dr. Robert S. Schwartz, now deputy editor of The New England Journal of Medicine.         In addition to her husband, Dr. Andre-Schwartz is survived by a son, Louis-George Schwartz of New York City; two sisters, Francoise Poutiers of Bordeaux, France, and Claude Andre of Paris, and a brother, Jean-Pierre Andre, also of Paris.       
         Elizabeth Flower, professor emeritus of philosophy at the University of Pennsylvania and co-author of a standard history of philosophy, died on Monday at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. She was 80 and lived in Philadelphia.         The cause was cancer, said Prof. Gary Hatfield, chairman of Penn's department of philosophy, from which she retired in 1985.         Dr. Flower, whose affiliation with the university dated from her student days, was the author with Murray G. Murphey of the two-volume "History of Philosophy in America" (Putnam, 1977). She herself was honored in 1988 with a volume "Values and Value Theory in Twentieth Century America: Essays in Honor of Elizabeth Flower" (Temple University Press), edited by Professor Murphey and Ivar Berg.         Among her multitude of students, many of whom now teach around the country, was the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. He attended her first graduate seminar, Ethics and Philosophy in History.         "Martin Luther King's contribution to the discussion was solid and articulate," she recalled later. "Interestingly, questions of discrimination did not seem to have come up, but questions of peace and of conflict, of moral order and the effectiveness of a moral stance -- as in Gandhi -- were much in the air. And in all this his thought was already vigorous and well forged."         Dr. Flower's teaching and writings were credited at Penn with having advanced the field of ethics. Many of her doctoral students went on to work in the ethics and philosophy of law.         Professor Hatfield said she had carried on the Pragmatist school of philosophy in the United States.         Elizabeth Farquhar Flower was born in Atlantic City. She received her Ph.D. at Penn in 1939, two years after she started her academic career as an assistant instructor. She received her promotion to full professor in 1974.         Dr. Flower is survived by her husband, Prof. Abraham Edel; a stepdaughter, Deborah Edel of Manhattan, and three stepsons.       
         Maggie Keswick, a Scots-born connoisseur of China and its sensuous, mysterious gardens, died on July 8 in London. She was 53 and had homes in London, Santa Monica, Calif., and Wellfleet, Mass.         The cause was breast cancer, said John Taylor Williams of Palmer & Dodge, the family's legal counsel in Boston.         Margaret Keswick Jencks hailed from a family that has lived and done business in China for nearly 140 years. She was born in Cowhill, Scotland, but spent much of her early life in post-revolutionary China.         She became known in the United States with the appearance of her book "The Chinese Garden" (1978), which was richly embellished by her own photography.         "Miss Keswick's is no ordinary garden tour," a reviewer for The New York Times wrote, "but a first-rate job of intellect, intelligently illustrated."         The book was reissued in paperback by St. Martin's Press in 1986 and remains in print.         Miss Keswick's father, Sir John Keswick, was a major trader at the head of the Scottish company Jardine Matheson. He spoke Chinese and became a trusted friend of Zhou Enlai, Mao Zedong's most influential advisor.         In 1982, she edited "The Thistle and the Jade," a history of Jardine Matheson on its 150th anniversary. She also contributed to the "Oxford Garden Companion" and to books by her husband, Charles Alexander Jencks, a post-modernist architect and professor at the University of California at Los Angeles School of Architecture.         For many years she was the chairwoman of the Keswick Foundation, based in Hong Kong. She established the first cancer hospice there and extended the foundation's work to China. Most recently she created a cancer-care center in Edinburgh, where she was undergoing hospital treatment.         She was educated at Oxford University, where she studied Middle English, and at the Architectural Association in London. After "The Chinese Garden" was published, she lectured widely in the United States.         She was also in demand as a garden designer, collaborating with Frank Gehry, the architect, and Claes Oldenburg, the artist.         She is survived by her husband; a son, John; a daughter, Lily Clare; two stepsons, Cosmo and Justin Jencks, all of London, and her mother, Clare Lady Keswick of Portrack, Scotland.       
         Dr. Berta Vogel Scharrer, a pioneering biomedical scientist and founding faculty member of the Albert Einstein College of Medicine at Yeshiva University, died on Sunday at her home in the Bronx. She was 88.         Harvard University, conferring an honorary doctorate on Dr. Scharrer in 1982, said her "research journeys into the world of insects have profoundly affected the study of human physiology." The particular insect she had studied since 1937 was the South American cockroach.         Dr. Scharrer's specialty was neuroendocrinology, the study of the interaction between the nervous and endocrine systems. At her death, she was distinguished professor emeritus of anatomy and structural biology and of neuroscience at Einstein. She had been affiliated with the college since it was founded in 1955. She reached emeritus status in 1978 but continued her research until a few months ago.         In 1928, Dr. Ernst Scharrer, her future husband, working in Germany, discovered what he called gland-nerve cells in the hypothalamus of a fish's brain. From this, the Scharrers developed the concept of neurosecretion -- secretions from nerve cells -- that gave rise in the 1930's and early 1940's to neuroendocrinology as a new discipline.         Berta Vogel was born in Munich, Germany, and received a doctorate in biology from the University of Munich in 1930. She married Dr. Scharrer in 1934, and they remained a team at Einstein until his accidental drowning in 1965. Though not Jewish, the Scharrers left Germany in 1937 because of Hitler's policies.         Early in their collaboration, they decided on a comparative approach, dividing the animal kingdom so that he would study vertebrates and she invertebrates. They determined that certain principles found in an insect could explain certain things about mammalian systems, and vice versa.         Their discovery of neurosecretions took years to find acceptance, as their peers resisted the notion that neurons could dispatch neurohormonal, blood-borne signals, an activity previously associated only with the hormonal endocrine cells.         Once neuroendocrinology became established, Dr. Scharrer received many honorary degrees and other honors in the United States and in Europe. She was given the National Medal of Science at a White House ceremony in 1985.         She is survived by a brother, Dr. Karl Vogel of Neustadt, Germany, and a sister, Lotte Vogel of Munich.       
         Susan McAllister Swap, an educator and writer who focused on involving parents in their children's schools, died last Thursday at her home in Winchester, Mass. She was 50.         The cause was brain cancer, her family said.         Dr. Swap joined the faculty of Wheelock College in Boston in 1977 and taught courses in child development, special education, consultation and parent studies. A past chairwoman of the department of professional studies, she was a professor of education and psychology.         Most recently she directed the Center on Families, Communities, Schools and Children's Learning, and the Center on College-School-Community Partnerships, two research programs at Wheelock.         She wrote articles about home-school partnerships and promoting the academic success of children from diverse ethnic backgrounds. Her books in print are "Managing an Effective Interview Program" (Teachers College, 1984), "Parent Involvement and Success for All Children: What We Know Now" (Institute for Responsive Education, 1990), "Schools Reaching Out and Success for All Children: Two Case Studies" (Institute for Responsive Education, 1990), and "Developing Home-School Partnerships: From Concept to Practice" (Teachers College, 1993).         Born in Bridgeport, Conn., she graduated magna cum laude from Radcliffe College and earned her Ph.D. in education and psychology at the University of Michigan. She taught at Tufts University before moving to Wheelock.         Dr. Swap is survived by her husband, Walter; a son, Clifford; a daughter, Alison, all of Winchester; her parents, John and Pauline McAllister of Fairfield, Conn.; two sisters, Joan Howard of Winterville, Ga., and June McAllister of Stratford, Conn., and a brother, Jef McAllister of Great Falls, Va.       
         Onnie Lee Logan, the Alabama midwife who used what she called her God-given motherwit to deliver hundreds of babies before her 1989 autobiography made her a favorite in feminist circles, died on Tuesday at the Mobile Infirmary in Mobile, Ala. By her own reckoning she was about 85.         When she was born "somewhere about 1910," she once noted, midwives in rural Alabama weren't overly scrupulous about filing birth records for the grandchildren of slaves.         Mrs. Logan, the 14th of 16 children, was born on a farm in Marengo County, outside Sweet Water, about 120 miles north of Mobile.         On the surface, her life was little different from those of other black women of her era in southern Alabama. As a child she picked cotton, sewed and ironed to make money for her family. And for all her infectious optimism and perpetual good cheer, even as a "granny," as midwives were known in the South, Mrs. Logan, the daughter and granddaughter of midwives, was hardly unique.         In 1910, about half of the births in the United States were assisted by midwives, and the percentage was far higher in the rural south. Their clients were generally so poor that even Mrs. Logan, who delivered virtually every child born in the predominantly black Mobile suburb of Prichard from 1931 to 1984, had to supplement her income by working as a maid.         What ultimately set Mrs. Logan apart was not her work, but her compelling sense that hers was a story that had to be told. Or, as she put it, "I just got so much experience in here that I just want to explode."         Although she was barely literate, Mrs. Logan said she was so determined to tell it she would be prepared to "scratch it out" herself.         That proved unnecessary when a family she worked for introduced her to Katherine Clark, a young Harvard graduate who came to Mobile in 1984 to teach English at the University of South Alabama and is now a professor of English at the University of New Orleans.         "As soon as I met her, I knew there was a book in her," Professor Clark said yesterday, recalling that she had taped 100 hours of Mrs. Logan's recollections before editing them into what became "Motherwit: An Alabama Midwife's Story" (Dutton, 1989).         The book, still in print as a Plume paperback, was widely praised both for its vivid accounts of Mrs. Logan's life told in her distinctive vernacular and for her unflinchingly optimistic spirit in the face of pervasive adversity.         "Motherwit" made Mrs. Logan something of a folk hero, and two years ago she was represented along with Simone de Beauvoir, Anne Frank, Maya Angelou, Lillian Hellman, Joan Didion and other feminist luminaries in "The Norton Book of Women's Lives" (Norton, 1993).         Although lay midwives were outlawed by the state of Alabama in 1976, Mrs. Logan had attained such stature in Mobile that she was allowed to continue her practice under a permit from local authorities until 1984, when she received an abrupt notice telling her there was no longer a need for her services.         Mrs. Logan, who had delivered babies for almost two decades before receiving a state license in 1949, retired from her profession, but refused to abandon her calling. Despite all the advances in medical services to the poor, she knew that midwives were too often not the alternative to hospitals, but to husbands.         "They're not going to stop me from doing the gift that God give me to do," she said. "I don't be going there on no license. I be going there as a friend to help that husband deliver his baby."         Mrs. Logan, who was married three times, is survived by her husband, Roosevelt Logan; a son, Johnnine Watkins of Moss Point, Miss; a sister, Louise Blackman of Pensacola, Fla.; six grandchildren and nine great-grandchildren.       
         Alice V. Keliher, whose experiences as a lightly trained teacher of ill-prepared first graders led her to become a renowned expert on early childhood education and a champion of giving children unreserved respect and affection, died on Tuesday at the Tucson Medical Center in Arizona. She was 92.         A longtime professor of education at New York University, Miss Keliher cherished her unofficial title as the "grandmother of day care."         In the 1930's, she conducted seminal research on childhood development with Arnold Gesell at Yale University. In the 1940's and 1950's, as a member of N.Y.U.'s faculty, she served on virtually every city, state and national conference devoted to children and wrote widely on the subject.         And in the 1960's, while winding down her wide-ranging academic career as a professor at Wheelock College in Boston, she became the Massachusetts regional training officer for Head Start, the Federal program designed to provide disadvantaged children with the preschool enrichment Miss Keliher had been preaching to parents and educators for decades.         Although she trained teachers at N.Y.U. from 1936 to 1960, World War II provided her with her major platform.         As director of child and youth services of the New York Office of Civilian Defense, and secretary of Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia's Committee on the Wartime Care of Children, Miss Keliher helped make day care an accepted staple of American life.         Her campaign for day care may have made her a legitimate feminist heroine, but Miss Keliher, who also helped lessen the burden on mothers by spearheading the development of kindergarten and nursery school, made it clear that her focus was not women, but their children.         Instead of talking about what "working mothers need," she said in 1949, the emphasis should be on "what makes a good next generation for America."         A native of Washington who received her teacher's certificate after two years of training, Miss Keliher was only 20 when she became a teacher in 1923. After four years in the Washington school system, she decided she could serve children better by teaching their teachers how to teach.         Obtaining bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees in three years at Teachers College at Columbia University, she joined Dr. Gesell in 1930. She secured the job with the renowned child psychologist, she later confided, because she was the only applicant who knew how to operate a movie camera, a skill needed in research based on close observation of minute changes in infant behavior.         For all her dedication to her work, Miss Keliher's abiding passion was opera, and for decades she was a fixture in the center of the first row of the first balcony at the Metropolitan Opera (at just over 5 feet tall, she needed an unobstructed view), where her frequent guest was Eleanor Roosevelt.         The two women, who became friends when Mrs. Roosevelt took an apartment in Miss Keliher's building near Washington Square Park, enjoyed trading favors: Mrs. Roosevelt let Miss Keliher take her N.Y.U. students on field trips to the Roosevelt estate at Hyde Park. Miss Keliher, who had the larger oven, let Mrs. Roosevelt roast her turkeys in her kitchen.         Miss Keliher also shared Mrs. Roosevelt's devotion to human rights.         In a little-known chapter of her life, her lawyer, J. Dan O'Neill, said yesterday, Miss Keliher helped several Jewish families escape from Germany and Austria in the late 1930's. Her lawyer said the enterprise was organized by the love of her life, a shadowy American intelligence agent whose death in World War II led Miss Keliher to vow to remain unmarried.         Miss Keliher later created a furor when she refused to attend an education conference at a club known to exclude Jews. And she was such an outspoken champion of women, including their need for birth-control devices, Mr. O'Neill said, that she became a virtual pariah to her own Roman Catholic Church.         For all her books, like "Life and Growth" and "A Critical Study of Homogenous Grouping," Miss Keliher stressed a single theme, one she summed up in 1955: "If I could say just one thing to parents, it would be simply that a child needs someone who believes in him no matter what he does."         She leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Helen Singer Kaplan, a pioneer in the field of sex therapy and founder of the country's first clinic for sexual disorders established at a medical school, died on Thursday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 66.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Dr. Kaplan was considered a leader among scientific-oriented sex therapists. She was noted for her efforts to combine some of the insights and techniques of psychoanalysis with behavioral methods.         She agreed with others in the field that sexual difficulties often had superficial origins. But she held that, in case an unconscious conflict lay at the root of the disorder, it could indicate deep emotional problems and require the therapist to resort to more analytical means.         Consequently, her approach was seen as psychosexual therapy, to distinguish it from sex therapy. And her arrival on the scene manifested the way psychoanalysts gradually adapted to new sex-therapy techniques.         Although not so well known to the public as the sex researchers William Masters and Virginia Johnson, Dr. Kaplan was a leader in her field. She also had her differences with the Masters-Johnson team, questioning their advocacy and use of two therapists working together because, she felt, one therapist of either sex would suffice.         Working as a clinical professor of psychiatry, she became the founder, in 1970, of the Human Sexuality Program at the Payne Whitney Clinic, one of the country's most prominent psychiatric clinics and part of the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center complex. She remained its director until her death.         Born Helen Singer in Vienna on Feb. 6, 1929, she came to the United States in 1940 and became a citizen in 1947. She graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor's degree in fine arts from Syracuse University in 1951 and earned a master's degree in psychology at Columbia University in 1952. She got a Ph.D in psychology in 1955 at Columbia.         In 1959, she received her medical degree from New York Medical College, where she completed a comprehensive course in psychoanalysis in 1970.         She trained in clinical psychology at Veterans Administration hospitals and clinics in Montrose, N.Y., and the Bronx, interned at Bronx Hospital and completed her training as a fellow of psychiatry at Bellevue Hospital and New York Medical College-Metropolitan Hospital Center.         There the first phase of her professional teaching career unfolded as she developed and coordinated a basic behavioral science program for psychiatric residents as well as a freshman medical course in psychiatry. She also developed and taught a required course in psychopharmacology.         From 1960 until she established her program at the Payne Whitney Clinic, she was an associate professor of psychiatry at New York Medical College and an associate attending psychiatrist at Metropolitan, Flower and B.S. Coler Hospitals. At Medical College and Metropolitan Hospital Center she also served as chief of psychosomatic and consultation services, co-director of the Behavior Therapy Unit, chairman of the Behavioral Science Teaching Program and director of a program for women residents with children.         She established new programs, including one to train the psychiatric and obstetrics-gynecology staff in human sexuality.         She was appointed a professor of psychiatry at New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in 1970. Aside from directing her program at the Payne Whitney, she was in charge of undergraduate teaching of psychiatry and curriculum development until 1976.         Her human sexuality program included an outpatient clinic for the evaluation and treatment of psychosexual disorders. This generated clinical materials for postgraduate training courses for enrolled physicians and mental-health professionals. Dr. Kaplan was in charge of all education and training programs in human sexuality for Cornell medical students and psychiatric residents at the Payne Whitney.         Dr. Kaplan was credited with 110 publications and 127 lectures and presentations taking in the full range of her specialty.         Several of her books remain in print. These include "New Sex Therapy: Active Treatment of Sexual Dysfunctions" (Random House, 1974), "Disorders of Sexual Desires and Other New Concepts and Techniques in Sex Therapy" (Brunner-Mazel, 1979), "The Evaluation of Sexual Disorders: Psychological and Medical Aspects" (Brunner, 1983), "The Illustrated Manual of Sex Therapy" (Brunner; 2d ed., 1987), "How to Overcome Premature Ejaculation" (Brunner, 1989), and, with Donald F. Klein, "Sexual Aversion, Sexual Phobias and Panic Disorder" (Brunner, 1987).         Dr. Kaplan is survived by her husband of 15 years, Charles P. Lazarus; two sons, Dr. Phillip Kaplan and Dr. Peter Kaplan, a daughter, Jennifer Kaplan-D'Addio, all of the Upper East Side; a brother, Frank Singer of California, and two grandsons.         Correction:  August 23, 1995, Wednesday         An obituary on Saturday of Dr. Helen Singer Kaplan, founder of the Human Sexuality Program at the Payne Whitney Clinic of New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center, omitted a survivor. She is Sofie Kane of Manhattan, Dr. Kaplan's mother.       
         Lee Hadley, an Iowa State English professor who helped turn a collaborative pedagogical sendup into an acclaimed literary career as half of a writing team known to young readers as Hadley Irwin, died on Tuesday at her home in Madrid, Iowa. She was 60.         The cause was cancer, said her collaborator, Annabelle Irwin, a retired Iowa State professor.         In the arcane world of children's literature in which 8-to-12-year-olds are termed middle-aged and a 17-year-old is deemed to have one teen-age foot in the grave, the Hadley Irwin books were aimed at audiences aged 12 to 16, known as young adults.         Specializing in a subgenre known as problem novels, they wrote about teen-agers dealing with such distinctly adult themes as racism ("Kim/Kimi"), suicide ("So Long at the Fair") and alcoholism ("Can't Hear You Listening").         Even those themes were considered tame compared with that of "Abby, My Love," their breakthrough 1985 novel that stunned the industry as the first in children's literature to deal with incest.         As collaborators, the women justified their fused pen name by writing in such a seamless voice that it was impossible to tell where Ms. Hadley left off and Mrs. Irwin began.         No wonder. The women, who began their books at Mrs. Irwin's lakeside home during summer vacations then revised during the school year, sometimes sat side by side at the same typewriter finishing each other's sentences.         "She was better at characters, and I was better at plots," Mrs. Irwin said.         Ms. Hadley, a wiry, energetic woman who never married, and the older, plumper Mrs. Irwin, the mother of four children, were a study in contrasts when they took their collaboration on the road with a series of tag-team speeches to education and publishing conferences.         Ms. Hadley, an Iowa native, graduated from Drake University and received a master's degree from the University of Wisconsin. She spent seven years teaching at a junior college in New Jersey before she joined the Iowa State faculty to teach creative writing in 1969, a year before Mrs. Irwin, a former elementary school teacher, arrived.         Mrs. Irwin traced their collaboration to their experience as the only members of a faculty committee whose sole product was a jointly written final report, a spoof they peppered with such leaden jargon as "cognitive learning."         The dean was not unamused. "We weren't fired," Mrs. Irwin said.         With more than a dozen books still in print and a new one, "Sarah With an H," which deals with anti-Semitism, coming soon from their publisher, the Simon & Schuster McElderry imprint, the women had strong steady sales, but not enough to give up their teaching jobs.         Hadley Irwin was never more than a sideline for Ms. Hadley. Her main focus was her teaching, a task she accomplished with such flair that she was the only woman on the Iowa State faculty who was made a full professor without benefit of a doctorate.         In a field where creative-writing teachers are judged by the published authors they train, Ms. Hadley assured herself a measure of instant success. In a class on magazine writing, she promised an A to any student who produced an acceptance check from a magazine and always had two or three students who made the grade.         She is survived by a sister, Mildred Rich of Oskaloosa, Iowa.       
         Evelyn Wood, whose search for a way to improve the lives of troubled girls led to the development of speed reading techniques prescribed by Presidents and endorsed by multitudes, died on Saturday in Hospice Family Care in Tucson, Ariz. Mrs. Wood, who lived in Tucson, was 86.         The tiny, soft-spoken woman who gave her name to Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics liberated students, professionals and business people from the habits that shackled them to the average American's reading rate of 250 to 300 words a minute.         In courses that proliferated from coast to coast and spread overseas, they learned the methods that enabled them not only to read two to five times faster but also to better retain what they read.         "So many people are dubious about trying my method because they think they're liable to miss a lot," Mrs. Wood said in an interview a quarter of a century ago. "I say, which would you rather do: eat a dish of rice kernel by kernel or take a spoonful to get a good taste? My reading technique is actually comprehension by accumulation."         In years of research ignited by a professor who read her 80-page term paper at an astonishing rate while retaining its content, she found people from all walks of life who could read from 1,500 to 6,000 words a minute and sometimes more. And Mrs. Wood (who could herself read 2,700 words a minute), discovered that they shared several traits:         *They read down the page rather than left to right.         *They read groups of words or complete thoughts rather than one word at a time.         *They avoided involuntary rereading of material.         *Their reading efficiency was applicable to a variety of materials.         In time, President John F. Kennedy sent a dozen members of the White House staff to the Evelyn Wood Reading Dynamics Institute in Washington. President Richard M. Nixon sent 35 high-ranking members of his Administration, and President Jimmy Carter followed suit.         Students learned to break the habits that slowed them, including saying words under their breath, or subvocalizing. And the hand or finger, sweeping down the page, was used to "pace" the eyes at increasingly faster speeds, while the reader was urged to concentrate not on single words but on groups of words -- sentences, clauses and the like -- that make up units of thought.         At one session, a college student devoured a sociology textbook at the rate of 14,000 words a minute. In another, 25 students were assigned to finish George Orwell's "Animal Farm" in 25 minutes, a feat that required a reading rate of 1,400 words a minute. Most finished in the allotted time, and most scored well on the comprehension test that followed.         There were few claims that extremely difficult or unfamiliar material could be mastered at accelerated rates. But it was clear that many people could be taught to read faster and more effectively.         "Speed is not most important, but only through speed do you get good comprehension," Mrs. Wood said.         It was a theory that Mrs. Wood began to develop during the late 1940's and early 1950's, when she was a teacher and girls' counselor at Jordan High School in Salt Lake City.         Dealing with underachievers with personality problems, Mrs. Wood realized that they had one thing in common. All were poor readers.         Mrs. Wood established the school's first remedial reading program and discovered that as the girls read better, their grades improved in every subject and they became better adjusted.         And she discovered one other thing: the faster the girls read, the better they read.         She began refining her techniques for faster reading.         The next breakthrough came when Mrs. Wood, who was born in 1909 in Logan, Utah, returned to the University of Utah. At the college where she had earned her bachelor's degree in English in 1929, she now pursued a master's degree in speech.         When she turned in her term paper to the head of the department, Dr. C. Lowell Lees, she recalled:         "I handed Dr. Lees a term paper and watched him flip through the 80 pages at a startling rate, grade the paper and hand it back. He appeared to be reading as fast as he could turn the pages. He knew the total content and was able to tell me not only what was in it, but also what was missing. Intrigued, I clocked him on other material and found he could read at a rate of 2,500 words a minute."         In 1958, when she was sent on a national promotional tour for "Reading Skills," a groundbreaking book on remedial reading written in collaboration with Marjorie Westcott Barrows of Jordan High, Mrs. Wood began asking everywhere, "Do you know anyone who can read fast?"         The answers led her to 53 people whose traits came to inform her teaching.         Later that summer, frustrated with her efforts to increase her own reading speed, she discovered the use of the hand as a pacer.         "Before I introduced that technique," she once told an interviewer, "only children in the early grades used their fingers on the printed pages to guide their reading. And then they were taught not to!"         In 1959, with her husband, Doug, Mrs. Wood established the first of her institutes, in Washington. In 1967, she sold the business. It has been owned since September 1993 by Pryor Resources, a business seminar training company in Kansas City, Kan.         Mrs. Wood continued to teach and was developing a remedial reading program for children when she suffered an incapacitating stroke in 1976.         Her husband died in 1987. She is survived by her daughter, Carol Davis Evans of Tucson; four grandchildren and three step-grandchildren.       
         Brigid Brophy, a novelist, critic, essayist and crusader for myriad causes ranging from better royalty payments for writers to better treatment for animals, died on Monday at a nursing home in Lincolnshire, England. She was 66 and had been suffering from multiple sclerosis for many years.         Miss Brophy was the author of 4 plays, 7 novels and 14 other books, but she is just as well known for her most successful campaign, for lending rights for authors. In 1979, her efforts resulted in a law that for the first time allowed authors to receive royalty payments from the British Government every time their books were checked out of a public library.         But Miss Brophy also campaigned -- even from her sickbed -- for the rights of women, of prisoners and of animals. She was a vice president of the National Anti-Vivisection Society, and no animal escaped her sympathy. She even became active in an anti-angling campaign, and at one point sent a letter to the fishing correspondent of The Daily Telegraph in which she compared anglers to "thugs who beat up old-age pensioners for fun" and quoted Lord Byron's remark that fishing was "the stupidest of pretended sports."         Brigid Antonia Brophy was born in 1929 in London, the only daughter of the Anglo-Irish novelist John Brophy. She was educated at St. Paul's Girls' School and later at Oxford, where she excelled as a scholar but was soon expelled because of drunken, raucous behavior. She was acting, she later wrote, "in the belief that I had more to learn by pursuing my personal life than from textual emendation, with the result that the authorities could put up with me for only just over a year.         "I came down at the age of 19 without a degree and with a consequent sense of nudity which I have never quite overcome."         In 1954, before she was even 30, she burst onto the literary scene when her novel "Hackenfeller's Ape," about an ape at the London Zoo and its increasingly close relationship to the professor observing its mating habits, won the Cheltenham Literary Festival First Prize for a first novel. Her novels are known for their imagination and acerbic wit, and include "The Snow Ball," in which the characters attend a ball dressed as figures from "Don Giovanni"; "Flesh," which she described as "an almost distressingly cold-blooded little story," and "In Transit," set, claustrophobically, in an airport transit lounge.         But she also developed a reputation as a sharp thinker and fierce intellectual who liked a good fight, and her nonfiction books tended to have provocative, often mischievous points of view. In 1967, for instance, she was one of the authors of "Fifty Works of English Literature We Could Do Without," an attack on a number of classic books including "Jane Eyre," which was likened by the authors to "gobbling a jar-full of school-girl stick-jaw." She also championed the writing of Ronald Firbank in "Prancing Novelist" (1973), subtitled "A Defense of Fiction in the Form of a Critical Biography in Praise of Ronald Firbank."         Miss Brophy, who spoke freely in her early years about her bisexuality and often referred to marriage as "an immoral institution," nonetheless married in 1954. Her husband, the art historian Michael Levey, shared her delight in literature and the arts. He became director of the National Gallery in 1973 and was knighted eight years later.         In a tribute to Miss Brophy in The Independent on Tuesday, her literary agent, Giles Gordon, described her as a "deeply shy, courteous woman" who wrote delightful thank-you letters and kept to rigorous standards in her work. "Woe betide the 'editor' who tried to rewrite her fastidious, logical, exact prose, change a colon to a semi-colon (or vice-versa), or try to spell 'show' other than 'shew,' slavish Shavian that Brophy was," Mr. Gordon wrote.         In 1979, Miss Brophy's physical problem was diagnosed as multiple sclerosis, which steadily worsened until she was housebound and had to use a wheelchair. She remained at home, looked after by paid companions, friends and her husband, who in 1987 quit his job to help care for her. But she continued to work with all the energy her illness would allow. In 1987 she published "Baroque 'n' Roll," a collection of essays in which she outlined, with lucidity and detail, the debilitating toll her condition had taken on her. Eventually, her condition deteriorated so badly that she had to move into the nursing home where she died.         She is survived by her husband and a daughter, Kate.       
         Eileen Chang, a popular novelist and short story writer whose finely honed psychological studies and precise language won her acclaim as a giant of modern Chinese literature, was found dead on Friday in the Los Angeles apartment where she had lived as a virtual recluse. She was 74.         Friends said that Miss Chang, known to Chinese readers as Chang Ai-ling, had died of natural causes several days before her building manager discovered her body after becoming alarmed that she had not answered her telephone.         Miss Chang, a native of Shanghai, was at once a beloved figure who had a huge devoted following in Taiwan, Hong Kong and in other Chinese communities around the world and a lionized author whose works, particularly her early short stories, were hailed as classics by literary critics.         News of her death drew front-page tributes in Taiwan and Hong Kong.         "She was a rarity," said Dominic Cheung, a poet and professor of East Asian languages at the University of Southern California.         Had it not been for the political division between the Nationalist and Communist Chinese, he said, she would have almost certainly won a Nobel Prize.         As it was, until recently her works had been suppressed in mainland China, largely because two of her most widely known novels, "Rice Sprout Song" (1954) and "The Naked Earth" (1956), both of which appeared in both Chinese and English, were unsparing in their criticism of Communists.         For all that, Miss Chang was largely apolitical in her life and in her works, many of them bitter love stories that captivated readers in Taiwan and Hong Kong, where several of her books and stories were made into movies. The films included "Love in a Fallen City" (1990), "The Rouge of the North" (1991) and "Red Rose, White Rose" (1995).         C. T. Hsia, a retired professor of Chinese at Columbia University who once called Miss Chang "the most gifted Chinese writer to emerge in the 40's," compared her favorably yesterday with such widely acclaimed writers as Katherine Mansfield, Katherine Anne Porter, Eudora Welty and especially Flannery O'Connor and Franz Kafka.         Like both O'Connor and Kafka, he said, she tended to be "a bit odd and lonely."         Loneliness was a theme of her life. According to her friends, Miss Chang's insights into human emotions, especially those of women in the throes of thwarted romance, were grounded in her experiences with a cruel father who abandoned her mother and her first husband, Hu Lan Cheng, a Chinese writer who collaborated with the Japanese in World War II and later betrayed Miss Chang with another woman.         Her second husband, Ferdinand Reyher, a friend of Bertold Brecht's whom she met at the MacDowell Colony in New Hampshire, died in 1967.         Miss Chang, who was forced by the Japanese invasion to abandon her college education in Hong Kong, enjoyed a measure of popular success after returning to Shanghai, but her works were dismissed as mere romances until her 1943 novella, "The Golden Cangue" (named for a form of restraint resembling the stocks used in colonial America), established her literary reputation.         Miss Chang, who returned to Hong Kong in 1952 and moved to the United States three years later, was such a recluse that she refused to meet the steady stream of prominent editors who sought her out.         Even her editor in Taiwan had to communicate with her by fax, sometimes waiting days for a reply because she used a machine at a neighborhood grocery store.         Last year she was persuaded to accept a major literary award in Taiwan, but, typically, she refused to accept it in person.         Instead she sent a group of photographs of herself dating back to the 1930's but including one recent likeness in which she looked so improbably young that she took the precaution of posing with a newspaper showing the date.         There are no survivors.       
         Helen K. Nearing, who with her husband, Scott Nearing, wrote about leaving the congested streets of Manhattan to find peace and happiness through hard work and self-sufficiency on a New England farm, died on Sunday in an automobile accident near her home in Harborside, Me. She was 91.         Mrs. Nearing, whose husband died at 100 in 1983, had continued to live alone in the farmhouse they built 40 years ago overlooking Penobscot Bay. She was killed when a car she was driving struck a tree, said Eliot Coleman, a friend who lives on a neighboring farm.         Between them, Mrs. Nearing and her husband wrote more than 50 books during their half-century of homesteading, including "Living the Good Life" and "Continuing the Good Life," written initially in pamphlet form and then published by Schocken in 1954 and 1970, respectively.         Although written shortly after the Depression, both books became primers for thousands of urbanites who dropped out of the corporate world in the early 1970's and headed for the quiet countryside.         Followers describe the Nearings as the "senior gurus" of the back-to-the-land movement.         "Materialism does not produce happiness," Mrs. Nearing told those who came to tour her Forest Farm and marvel that, in an age of mass communications, she still made do without radio or television.         "She gave in and had a telephone installed about 10 years ago so she could keep in touch with all her friends around the world," said Mr. Coleman, who with his wife, Barbara Damrosch, is host of a cable television series called "Natural Gardening."         A lifelong vegetarian, Mrs. Nearing also did not take aspirin or use a credit card. Instead, she helped to restore the soil of her farm, build a stone farmhouse and outbuildings and plant an organic garden. In her pantry, she filled barrels with flour and sugar, much like New England dwellers a hundred or more years before her.         "In November, the rafters in our big country kitchen are hung with braids of onions and shallots, with ears of dried corn, with drying herbs (mint, tarragon, thyme, parsley, celery, sage and lovage)," she once wrote in a letter to The New York Times.         "Of bottled canned goods in the kitchen cellar, we have 160 quarts of vegatable soup and tomato juice, 132 quarts of rose hips, 80 quarts of applesauce, 146 quarts of raspberries, and jars and jars of jam," she wrote.         Mrs. Nearing drew a parallel between the people who immigrated to New England in the 1700's and "the many young people of today who find no satisfactory way to exercise or develop their talents and interests in modern city or suburb."         "They are willing and eager to clear their land, build their homes, dig and cultivate their own gardens and subsist on their own work," she said. "They are finding out that it is possible to live daily self-sufficient lives even in the middle of the 20th century."         Believing in the adage "waste not, want not," she wrote about all her experiences, providing New Age homesteaders with 10- and 20-year projects leading toward "the good life."         "The Maple Sugar Book," which she wrote with her husband and which was published by Schocken in 1950, told not only of the art and history of sugaring but also of the practical details of sugar making.         Another primer, "Building and Using Our Sun-Heated Greenhouse," published in 1971 by Dutton and now out of print, told of how to grow vegetables year-round in New England without artificial heating.         Among the books that Mrs. Nearing wrote alone were "Wise Words on the Good Life" (Schocken, 1983) and "Simple Food for the Good Life" (Stillpoint, 1983), which she described as "an anti-cooking book that advocates fresh raw foods and minimal cooking."         Her latest work, to be published this month by Tilbury House, "Light on Aging and Dying," is a collection of quotations inspired by the death of her husband 12 years ago.         Mrs. Nearing, who was born in Ridgewood, N.J., graduated from Ridgewood High School, then traveled extensively aboard, studying the violin, which she gave up for gardening when she married Mr. Nearing.         The Nearings began their long journey in search of the good life in 1932, when Mr. Nearing, a professor of economics, left the academic world and moved far away from New York City and the Depression to the wilderness of Vermont, where they built their first farm.         Twenty years later, feeling crowded by a nearby ski lift and growing tourism, they headed for Maine.  They kept a car and a pickup truck but permitted no machines on the farm that were not run by human or animal power.         According to the Nearings' wishes, an education and retreat center is to be established on Forest Farm after their deaths. The nonprofit center, to be called the Good Life Center, is to be administered and financed in part by the Trust for Public Land of Boston, an organization that preserves rural sites and crafts.         The Social Science Institute, formed in 1953 to print political and economic pamphlets written by Mr. Nearing, will become part of the Good Life Center.         Mrs. Nearing is survived by a sister, Alice Vaughan of Dorset, Vt.; a niece, Barbara Tuttle, and a nephew, C. B. Vaughan, both of Dorset, and a stepson, Robert Nearing of Troy, Pa.         A memorial service will be held at 2 P.M. on Sunday, Oct. 1, at the Brookville Community Center in South Brookville, Me.       
         Anyone attending the inauguration this weekend of Ruth Simmons as Smith College's ninth president will be likely to note the presence of such luminaries as Toni Morrison, the Nobel Prize-winning author; Johnnetta Cole, the president of Spelman College; Cornel West, the scholar, and Henry Louis Gates, the writer and chairman of the Afro-American studies department at Harvard.         But they might miss the people who Ruth Simmons believes are the most important -- those responsible for her becoming the first black president of one of the country's most elite women's colleges. They are her nine brothers and sisters: Elbert, Wilford, Atherine, Albert, Arnold, Nora, Clarence, Ozella and Azella. Her eighth-grade teacher, Modria Caraway. Her high school drama teacher, Vernell Lillie.         Her kindergarten teacher, Ida Mae Henderson, would like to be there, but at age 85, she is not strong enough to make the trip alone from Grapeland, Tex. "Miss Ida Mae," Dr. Simmons said. "I revere her."         Dr. Simmons, who is 50, is the great-great-granddaughter of slaves. She began her journey on a cotton farm in Grapeland, in East Texas. Her parents, the late Isaac and Fannie Stubblefield, were sharecroppers. Dr. Simmons was the youngest of 12 children -- two brothers are dead -- and was 7 when the family moved to a poor section of Houston. Her father went to work in a factory and eventually became pastor of the Mount Hermon Missionary Baptist Church. Her mother scrubbed floors for white families.         To Henry Louis Gates, the appointment of a black woman to the top job at Smith is "a major event in the history of American letters." Professor Gates, who regards Dr. Simmons as a mentor, said, "She's the Jackie Robinson of college presidents."         Ask Ruth Simmons how she did it, how she made her way from Grapeland to the provost's job at Spelman College to vice provost at Princeton University to the presidency of Smith, and she seems startled by the question. "I didn't make it happen," she said in an interview the other day in her wood-paneled office at Smith. "That's just the point."         It was her teachers at the segregated schools she attended, W. R. Banks Elementary in Grapeland and Phyllis Wheatley High in Houston, who made it happen, she said. "They thought I belonged in college," she said. "And they were convinced they would get me there. They protected me, especially after my mother died."         She was 15 when her mother lost her battle with kidney disease. "I had a remarkable mother," said Dr. Simmons, who is 50. "When she would do day's work, she would sometimes take me with her to white people's houses when I was a little girl. The thing I remember vividly is how good she was at what she did. She was very demanding in terms of her own work -- Do it well, do it thoroughly, whatever you do."         After graduation from high school, she went to Dillard University, a historically black institution in New Orleans, where she majored in Romance languages.         "Vernell Lillie wrote to Dillard, which is where she had gone, and asked them to provide a scholarship for me," Dr. Simmons said.         Ms. Lillie, a professor of African studies at the University of Pittsburgh, said in a telephone interview: "She was brilliant. I was very fortunate to be a part of her life."         The scholarship did not cover everything. "I didn't have enough money to buy clothes," said Dr. Simmons, who was elegantly dressed the other morning in a long, dark-green pleated skirt and matching jacket, with a double strand of pearls and small gold hoop earrings. "And I'll never forget one of my teachers asked me to come over to her house, and she went to her closet and she took enough clothes out for me to go to college."         Her family pitched in, too. "My brothers and sisters would send me what they could," she said. "They were all starting families. Sometimes it would be $5, or $10."         Her brother Wilford Stubblefield, who is 16 years older, was working at an oil refinery in Houston as a janitor, the only job open to a black man at the refinery in those days.         "We all helped her -- probably not as much as we should have," Wilford said in a recent telephone interview from his home in Houston. "She was the second one that had gone off to college. Naturally, we were proud."         Another brother, Clarence Stubblefield, who is 54 and a high school basketball coach in Houston, had gone to Prairie View College in Texas on a basketball scholarship.         Dr. Simmons said: "I'm not the brightest person in my family. I was very lucky. I came along at the right time."         Growing up in the segregated South, she said, she had no specific ambition, only a hunger to learn. "One really didn't aspire to do professional things," she said. "I think my mother must have thought that eventually perhaps I would get enough education to be self-sustaining and to do something comfortable, perhaps housework."         Instead, she earned an undergraduate degree from Dillard, and master's and doctorate degrees in Romance languages at Harvard. She became an assistant professor of French, and later an assistant dean at the University of New Orleans.         In the meantime, at age 22, she married Norbert Simmons, a lawyer and businessman. They had a son, Khari, now 22 and a student at Morehouse College in Atlanta, and a daughter, Maya, 18, who plans to attend Spelman next year.         After the couple separated in the mid-1980's -- they were divorced in 1989 -- Dr. Simmons began her administrative rise at Princeton. She brought Ms. Morrison and Professor West to the Princeton faculty. She tried to persuade Professor Gates to join the faculty, too, he said.         There was one problem with Ms. Morrison's appointment: the faculty search committee wanted a resume. And Ms. Morrison, offended by the request, refused to submit one.         So Ruth Simmons wrote Toni Morrison's resume for her. "Here's my philosophy about life," said Dr. Simmons, who considers Ms. Morrison her best friend. "Don't dwell on insignificant things."         Ms. Morrison said in a telephone interview: "She's still a bit of a miracle as far as I'm concerned. She has an unusual combination of real politics and integrity, and this very keen sense of morals which does not interfere with her generosity and her wide spiritedness. She's extremely creative in terms of solving other people's problems. And she's a lot of fun."         For the 14-member presidential search committee at Smith, Dr. Simmons was the unanimous first choice. "We had a wish list of the qualities we wanted," said one member of the committee, Peter Rose, a sociology professor. "She seemed to fill them all. Race was not an issue."         Of Smith's 2,800 students, 86 are black. There are 15 black faculty members -- out of 300.         One goals, Dr. Simmons said, is to interest more black women in Smith. She hopes her presence will help. "If it's not a good place for African-American students," she said, "it's not a good place for me."         Her friend, Professor Gates, said he was already planning ahead. "I'm hoping Maggie and Liza Gates will go to Smith now," he said, referring to his teen-age daughters. "It never would have occurred to me before Ruth became president."         For now, her presence has electrified the campus. She walks everywhere. She invites students into her office to talk. She listens to them, they say.         Tigress Osborne, a black senior, said she returned to Smith last spring after taking some time off. "One of my friends said, 'You won't believe what's happened: we have a black president!' " Ms. Osborne said. "There's a moment when you think if Smith picked a black woman, how black is she? Is she going to be interested in us?"         She added, "But there's a real sense of her blackness. She also has a good handle on how to be not just the black president, on how not to cater to just black students."         Watching Dr. Simmons mingle at the senior tea last week, one senior, Kathryn Fields, who is white, said: "She's so cool. She's so young. She's new, she's exciting, she's going to make this school amazing."         At her inauguration, the new president will be carrying a Bible her mother gave her father on the day they were married.         "I know the board of trustees thinks I'm trying to live up to the standards they set for me, and that's O.K.," she said. But she is aiming toward the higher standard set for her by Fannie Stubblefield, who never had the chance to go beyond the seventh grade. "Every day that I'm here," Dr. Simmons said, "I try to be worthy of the kind of person my mother wanted me to be."       
         Annie Kriegel, a French ex-Communist who was a historian and analyst of Communism, died on Aug. 26 in a Paris hospital. She was 68 and lived in Paris.         She had cancer, said the French newspaper Le Figaro, which reported her death on Aug. 28.         Professor Kriegel had retired from academic work after teaching at the University of Paris-Nanterre from 1969 into the 1990's.         As a teen-ager, she was active in the Resistance against the Nazi occupation of her country. She became prominent in the postwar French Communist Party but resigned in 1957.         Her 1972 book, "The French Communists," was hailed in The New York Times Book review by an American historian of France, Robert O. Paxton of Columbia University, as "the most probing single work on the French Communist Party, and perhaps on any Western Communist party." She wrote more than a dozen books, beginning in 1964.         A British historian of France, Douglas Johnson, wrote in The Independent on Friday that Professor Kriegel was respected as an individual force among French intellectuals.         Professor Johnson -- whose French-born wife, Madeleine, roomed with Professor Kriegel in the 1940's -- said the explanation for her "remarkable career is to be found in her wartime experience" and gave this account:         "Coming from a Jewish-Alsatian family and having passed idyllic school days in the Marais district of Paris, she encountered the anti-Semitic legislation of the occupation and then the infamous roundup of Jews on 16 July 1942.         "As the men were forcibly separated from the women and children, she heard screams which she said contained all the pain that life and death provide. She sat on a bench and wept. 'It was on that bench that I left my childhood,' she afterwards said."         Then she escaped Paris and joined a Communist Resistance group. After the war she studied at the Ecole Normale Superieure de Sevres, held posts in teaching and related fields and wrote for Le Figaro.         Annie Becker Kriegel was born in Paris. Her marriage to Guy Besse ended in divorce. She is survived by her husband of 40 years, Dr. Arthur Kriegel; and four children, Maurice, Danielle, Irene and Emmanuel.       
         Lita Annenberg Hazen, a major philanthropist in medical research whose interests encompassed art, music and education, died on Monday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 86 and lived in Manhattan.         Her death was caused by complications from lung cancer, a grandson, Nicholas Polsky, said.         Mrs. Hazen had what her daughter, Cynthia Hazen Polsky, called "a great passion for family" and took a personal interest in the activities she supported. She was a friend of most of the scientists whose institutions she helped, and although she was rarely seen at the glittering social events favored by her peers, she had an active social life centered on the arts and science community.         "Medical discoveries were the most exciting and important things that she could imagine, and I don't remember her ever thinking differently or anything that competed with that," Mrs. Polsky said. "She always envisioned that someone would have a better answer."         The Lita Annenberg Hazen Charitable Trust played an important part in numerous medical and scientific programs on both coasts and made significant contributions to cultural institutions, including the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art, the National Gallery and the Metropolitan Opera.         The Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory on Long Island was one of Mrs. Hazen's principal interests. Hazen Tower, a building at the laboratory, commemorates her participation as a founding donor of its Neuroscience Center.         "Lita Hazen was a wonderful patron of pure science, who enjoyed bright and unusual people who would say things that she wouldn't expect," said Dr. James Watson, the Nobel laureate who is director of the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. .         Dr. Richard A. Lerner, president of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif, said: "She, like Mary Lasker, was one of the great ladies of American science. These kinds of individuals play important roles in science, far beyond the simple ability to donate money. In fact, they become a magnet around which scientists gather."         Dr. Lerner added, "We are losing our 'great ladies of science,' " and he noted that with their death and with no such new individuals on the horizon, "there will not be much to replace them, and a whole culture that fostered science will come to an end."         The Hazen Trust made possible the purchase of land for a science park at the institute and also financed a chair in immunochemistry. A three-building complex at the institute, to be dedicated on Oct. 15, was named in honor of Mrs. Hazen.         Mrs. Hazen was the sixth of eight children of Sadie and Moses L. Annenberg, who founded Triangle Publications and whose holdings eventually included The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Philadelphia Daily News, the Daily Racing Form, TV Guide and radio and television interests. She was one of seven sisters, all of whom donated considerable portions of their inherited wealth to public institutions. Her brother, Walter H. Annenberg, the former United States Ambassador to Great Britain, is a major benefactor of art institutions, and a sister, Enid Haupt of New York, has devoted much of her fortune to public gardens and horticultural institutions, as well as museums and libraries.         In 1963, Mrs. Hazen was a founding sponsor of the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, served as a trustee of its medical center from 1976 and contributed, with her siblings, to the construction of the 33-story Annenberg Building at the center, devoted to medical care, education and research. She also provided support for a neuroendocrinology laboratory at the Mount Sinai Medical Center that was named after her and, from 1979 to 1985, a $100,000 annual award for excellence in clinical research. The award, also named for her and administered by the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, was divided between the winner and a young medical scientist chosen by the winner.         The Lita Annenberg Hazen Trust, created in 1952, also established significant scholarships and professorships at Mount Sinai, including the Moses L. and Sadie C. Annenberg Professorship in Molecular Biology, the Annenberg Scholarships in Cardiology and the Lita Annenberg Hazen Professorship in Immunochemistry.         Two grants of $1 million each helped establish and finance the Neurosciences Institute and Neurosciences Research Foundation at Rockefeller University in New York. The grants enabled multidisciplinary groups of scientists from around the world to meet and discuss their work. An atrium garden at the university was named in her honor.         In 1980, she initiated a biomedical workshop program at the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies and a fellowship that paid for the participation of scientists, physicians and administrators. The workshops were also held at other venues, in Stockholm, Venice and at the University of California at Los Angeles and at San Francisco.         Dr. Martin Meyerson, a former president of the University of Pennsylvania who was chairman of the workshops for a decade, noted that she insured that participants ranged from Nobel laureates to junior scientists and that "she relished providing a bit of luxury to them, a good dinner, putting them up in pleasant places."         Dr. Elaine Pagels, a professor of religion at Princeton University who was a longtime friend, said: "She had a remarkable mind, and had she been born in another generation, she might well have done something herself. She understood what research was about, even in its beginning and theoretical stage."         Mrs. Hazen was born in Milwaukee on Oct. 30, 1909, and attended the Calhoun School in New York. In 1936, she married Joseph H. Hazen, a lawyer, film producer, art collector and philanthropist at a double ceremony in which Mrs. Hazen's sister, Enid, was married to the investment banker Ira Haupt.         Mr. Hazen, a former vice president and director of Warner Brothers, wrote the contract between the studio and Edison Vitaphone that resulted in "The Jazz Singer," the first movie with sound. Later, he and Hal B. Wallis, the producer, became partners. Their company, Wallis-Hazen Productions, made films like "Come Back, Little Sheba," "Gunfight at the O.K. Corral" and "True Grit." During that period, the 1940's to 60's, Mrs. Hazen spent several months each year in Beverly Hills.         It was Mr. Hazen's admiration for Edward G. Robinson's collection of paintings that encouraged Mr. Hazen to become a collector and amass a considerable collection of 20th-century art, including work by Toulouse-Lautrec, Van Gogh, Modigliani, Leger, Kandinsky, Braque and Picasso. The Joseph H. Hazen Foundation still contributes to a number of arts institutions.         "My mother's interest in art developed with her marriage to my father," Mrs. Polsky said. "My father was more passionate about art but my mother also loved museums and paintings. She was particularly interested in the Impressionists."         Mrs. Hazen's trust made sizable contributions to arts institutions, particularly the Metropolitan Museum of Art. In most cases, the trust provided the funds for purchases, among them two important South Indian bronzes, a 14th-century "Yashoda and Krishna" and an 11th-century "Shiva, Parvati and their son Skanda," for the museum's Irving Galleries of South and Southeast Asian Art.         Mrs. Hazen and her husband also established the Gwynne Hazen Cherry Memorial Laboratory in Oncology and Hematology, in memory of their other daughter, at the Marion Davies Hospital, a unit of the University of California, Los Angeles, Medical Center. Mrs. Cherry died of lymphoma in 1965 at the age of 32.         Mr. Hazen died in 1994 at age 94, after 58 years of marriage. Mrs. Hazen is survived by Mrs. Polsky of Manhattan; four grandchildren; three great-grandchildren; a brother, Walter H. Annenberg of Rancho Mirage, Calif., and three sisters, Mrs. Haupt, Janet Hooker and Evelyn Hall of Manhattan.         Correction:  October 4, 1995, Wednesday         An obituary yesterday about Lita Annenberg Hazen, a leading philanthropist in medical research, misstated her age in some editions. She was 85, not 86.       
         Judy Dearing, a costume designer for scores of musicals, dances and plays, as well as a dancer and choreographer, died on Saturday at New York Hospital.         She was 55 and lived in Manhattan. Her family said the cause of death was acute pneumonia.         Ms. Dearing began her career dancing with Miriam Makeba and acting with the Negro Ensemble Company. But she devoted much of the last 20 years to designing costumes for a wide range of theater arts. In 1985 she won an Obie for her World War II uniforms for Charles Fuller's drama "A Soldier's Play."         As a dancer, Ms. Dearing made her own costumes, a skill she said she had learned as a child. In 1976, she was hired by Oz Scott, the director of Ntozake Shange's "For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide/When the Rainbow Is Enuf"; she was given $100 to create costumes for the show's seven performers.         Her penny-pinching solution was to buy a long bolt of inexpensive crepe-back satin from which she made seven dresses dyed seven different colors.         She went on to design costumes for "Checkmates," "The Legacy of Williams and Walker," two shows now on Broadway, "Swinging on a Star" and "Having Our Say," and a production of "Porgy and Bess" that is now on tour.         She also designed costumes for "Shimada," "Once on This Island" (for which she received a Tony nomination), "The Poison Tree," "What the Wine Sellers Buy," "Death and the King's Horsemen," "The Mighty Gents," and "Lamppost Reunion."         Her Off Broadway credits include "Moms," "Ma Rose," "Trick" and "Split Second."         For the New York Shakespeare Festival, her credits included "The Forbidden City," "Jonah," "The Dance" and "The Railroad."'         Her costumes for the Alvin Ailey Dance Theater included "Nubian Lady," "Inside" and "I See the Moon."         Woven through her highly colorful and original designs was a folkloric look. She used printed kente cloth, Dutch cotton prints, raw silk and chiffon with metallics. "A costume has to be natural," she said in an interview in 1990silk and chiffon with metallics. "A costume has to be natural," she said in an interview in 1990. "Everything has to be set up to look natural."         Ms. Dearing grew up in Manhattan and graduated from City College, where she majored in mathematics and science. She began her career in the theater as a dancer. She married John Parks, another dancer, and collaborated with him on a number of concerts. She also performed with the Sun Ock Lee Dance Company.         Ms. Dearing was also a professor of design at Howard University.         She is survived by her husband; a daughter, Aissatou Parks of Manhattan; her mother, Elizabeth Dearing of Tuskegee, Ala.; her father, Charles, of Manhattan; two sisters, Carole, of Tuskegee, and Bianca, of Manhattan; and two brothers, Charles, of Tuskegee, and Andre, of Manhattan.       
         Simone Gallimard, a power in the French book-publishing world, died Monday in a clinic in Neuilly, a suburb of Paris. She was 77 and a longtime resident of Paris.         The cause was cancer, the Associated Press reported.         Mrs. Gallimard was the chief executive officer, with the title of president-director general, of the venerable Paris publishing house Mercure de France, which she had led since 1962. The house is known, among other things, for publishing works by prominent French writers and for printing French literary classics.         She was the widow of Claude Gallimard, a member of a distinguished French publishing family whom she married in 1939. Her father was a Government official, and her maiden name was Simone Cornu.         After working behind the scenes in publishing, she became the head of Mercure de France after it was purchased in 1958 by her father-in-law, Gaston Gallimard. Gaston Gallimard was the founder of the Parisian publishing house Editions Gallimard, which is now partly owned by the Gallimard family.         Mercure de France, founded in 1894, had published works by Proust and by the  poet Guillaume Apollinaire but went into a decline before Mrs. Gallimard took its helm. Under her leadership, it prospered and published books by such well-known French writers as the poet and man of letters Yves Bonnefoy, currently a visiting professor at Williams College in Williamstown, Mass., and the poet Henri Michaux.         Mrs. Gallimard once confessed that "being a woman, bourgeois and inexperienced, I had a hard time" when she first took charge of the publishing house. But the French news agency Agence France-Presse, in reporting her death,  said that she was "the soul of Mercure de France for 33 years."         As chief executive officer, she played roles including, as Agence France-Presse put it, "editor, public relations person" and "discoverer of young authors."         She also became involved in a publishing furor. In 1975 she published a novel, "Life Before Us," which had been written, according to Agence France-Presse, by the French novelist Romain Gary using the pseudonym Emile Ajar, without her knowledge that it was a pseudonym. The book was translated into 23 languages, sold 1.3 million copies, won a French literary prize -- the Prix Goncourt -- and was made into the film "Madame Rosa."         Revelations about the novel's authorship embarrassed connoisseurs of literature who had failed to realize that Mr. Gary had written the book.         Mrs. Gallimard's survivors include her four children, Francoise, Christian, Antoine and Isabelle. Antoine and Isabelle Gallimard are executives of the publishing company.       
         Ruth Wilmanns Lidz, a clinical professor of psychiatry at the Yale University School of Medicine, died on Monday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. She was 85 and lived in Woodbridge, Conn.         A clinical professor since 1965, she had continued to work in the department, pursuing her interest in the psychotherapy of schizophrenia. She also remained an active member of the Western New England Psychoanalytic Society and the American Psychoanalytic Society.         She was born in Heidelberg, Germany, the daughter of Karl Wilmanns, a professor and director of Heidelberg University's psychiatry department. She left Germany shortly after the Hitler regime came to power and completed her medical education in Switzerland.         During World War II, she was on the faculty of Johns Hopkins University before entering psychoanalytical practice in Baltimore and New Haven. At Yale, she became known for her work with schizophrenic and other seriously disturbed patients and for dealing with the emotional factors in adolescent pregnancies.         Dr. Lidz is survived by her husband of 56 years, Theodore Lidz, a Yale professor emeritus of psychiatry, and three sons, Victor, of Villanova, Pa., Charles, of Pittsburgh, and Jerome, of Eugene, Ore.       
         Dorothy Porter Wesley, a librarian who played the primary role in building Howard University's collection of books and other materials for the study of black history and culture, died on Sunday in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., at the home  of her daughter, where she had moved recently from Washington. She was 91.         Mrs. Wesley retired in 1973 as the curator of the Moorland-Spingarn Research  Center, a center for research involving documents about black history and kindred fields. The center is on the Howard campus in Washington.         She began acquiring books and other materials in 1930 and from then until 1973, the center's holdings grew to 180,000 items from 3,000. They include letters, manuscripts, pamphlets, books, oral-history materials and microfilms.         The centeris one of the world's largest repositories of materials for studying black history and culture, its current director, Dr. Thomas C. Battle,  said yesterday.         Over the years, Mrs. Wesley was also known by the surname Porter and the double surname Porter Wesley. Her 1971 book, "Early Negro Writings 1760-1837" was republished this fall, by Black Classic Press, with her name given as Dorothy Porter.         She began working at Howard in 1928 as a library cataloger and was named, in  1930, librarian of what was to become the Moorland-Spingarn center's collection. At the time, it was called the Moorland Foundation because it consisted chiefly  of a books donated by Dr. Jesse Moorland, a Howard trustee; in 1946 the book collection of Arthur B. Spingarn was added to it.         Mrs. Wesley's other writings include the books "North American Negro Poets: A Bibliographical Checklist" (1945), "Negro Protest Pamphlets" (1969) and "The Negro in the United States: A Selected Bibliography" (1970).         Mrs. Wesley, whose maiden name was Burnett, was born in Warrenton, Va., and reared in Montclair, N.J. She went received a bachelor's degree in 1928 from Howard and a master's degree in library science in 1932 from Columbia University.         Her first husband, James Amos Porter, who had headed Howard's fine arts department, died in 1970. She married Charles Harris Wesley, an authority on black history and former professor and dean at Howard, in 1979. He died in 1987.         Her survivors include her daughter, Constance Burnett Porter Uzelac of Fort Lauderdale.       
         Dr. Renata A. Calabresi, a clinical psychologist who was active in the anti-Fascist underground in Italy in the 1930's, died last Friday at her home in New Haven, Conn. She was 96.         Dr. Calabresi, who was born in Ferrara, received her Ph.D. from the University of Florence in 1923 and went to teach at the University of Rome. With her brother, Dr. Massimo E. Calabresi, she helped publish and distribute the leading underground newspaper of the Italian Resistance, Non Mollare (Don't Give Up) and was jailed for a time by the Mussolini Government.         She fled Italy and arrived in the United States in 1940, initially teaching  at the New School for Social Research and Hunter College. In 1947 she joined the Veterans Administration in Newark and worked as a clinical psychologist and coordinator for the training of future psychologists until her retirement in 1969.         Dr. Calabresi is survived by two nephews, Dr. Paul Calabresi of Barrington, R.I., and Judge Guido Calabresi of Woodbridge, Conn. Her brother, a former professor of medicine at Yale University, died in 1988.       
         Elizabeth Ball Holmes, a University of Hawaii speech professor who was one of the state's foremost experts on Hawaiian pidgin English, died on Dec. 17. She was 95.         Professor Holmes, also known as Elizabeth Carr, devoted most of her research  to the study of Hawaii's pidgin dialect, a combination of English, Hawaiian and  other languages.         In her book, "Da Kine Talk, from Pidgin to Standard English in Hawaii," she  contended that the language had evolved into a distinct regional dialect and could no longer be considered in its pidgin stage, the period when Asian immigrants learned a modicum of basic English from plantation bosses.       
         Toni Cade Bambara, a writer and documentary film maker who was celebrated for her intricate use of Black English in fiction, died on Saturday at a hospital in Philadelphia. She was 56 and lived in Philadelphia.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Karma Bene Bambara of Philadelphia.         In the early 1970's, Ms. Bambara was a major contributor to the emerging genre of contemporary black women's literature, along with the writers Toni Morrison and Alice Walker and others. Many of her stories focused on men and women living in black neighborhoods in big cities or small Southern towns -- as  one reviewer put it, "young women and men who formed their political convictions in the fury of the 60's and find themselves gasping for air in the torpor of the 70's, manicurists, singers and students struggling to trim the rhetoric of their wishes to the smaller, tighter fit of reality."         What critics found most striking about Ms. Bambara's fiction, though, were the structure and language she used. Rather than using traditional linear plots, she would often use flashbacks, stream of consciousness and interweavings of plot and subplot to tell a story. She would frequently weave black dialects into her prose, creating a unique, complex language that was widely admired by critics.         Ms. Bambara published one novel, "The Salt Eaters," in 1980. She also edited  several anthologies and wrote several short-story collections, including "Gorilla, My Love," published in 1972, and "The Sea Birds Are Still Alive," published in 1977. Reviewing "Gorilla, My Love" for The New York Times in 1972,  C.D.B. Bryan wrote that her stories were unusual because they addressed racial issues in a tone more thoughtful than angry.         "Toni Cade Bambara tells me more about being black through her quiet, proud,  silly, tender, hip, acute, loving stories than any amount of literary polemicizing could hope to do," Mr. Bryan wrote in the review. "She writes about love: a love for one's family, one's friends, one's race, one's neighborhood, and it is the sort of love that comes with maturity and inner peace."         Ms. Bambara was born in New York City, and growing up, she spent much of her  time in public libraries. Louis Massiah, a friend and colleague in Philadelphia, said that as a child, Ms. Bambara would often visit a Harlem branch of the New York Public Library, where she was inspired by two black poets: Gwendolyn Brooks, whose photograph hung there, and Langston Hughes, who she said would often come and talk to children there.         Ms. Bambara graduated from Queens College with a bachelor's degree in theater arts in 1959. In 1965, she received a master's degree in American studies from the City College of New York. She was an assistant professor of English at Rutgers University from 1969 to 1974, and she also held various teaching positions at Duke University, Atlanta University and Spelman College, among others.         From 1986 until this year, Ms. Bambara taught script writing at Scribe Video  Center in Philadelphia. Mr. Massiah said that during her tenure at the center, she helped start the careers of several black women film makers. She wrote and lectured frequently about film, stressing the importance of movies that dispel Hollywood stereotypes about blacks.         Over the last decade, Ms. Bambara also collaborated with Mr. Massiah on several television documentaries, including "The Bombing of Osage Avenue," about the police assault on Move headquarters in Philadelphia, and a biography of Cecil B. Moore, a prominent civil rights activist in Philadelphia. Her most recent project was a documentary about the life of W.E.B. Du Bois, which she worked on with Mr. Massiah and several others.         Throughout her life, Mr. Massiah said, Ms. Bambara fought for the rights of minorities, women, children and the homeless.         In addition to her daughter, she is survived by her mother, Helen Brehon of Queens, and a brother, Walter Cade of Queens.       
         Dr. Barbara Jelavich, a prominent scholar of Eastern European history with a particular interest in the Balkan countries, died on Saturday at Bloomington Hospital in Bloomington, Ind. She was 71 and lived in Bloomington.         The cause was cancer, said a spokesman for Indiana University.         She was on the faculty of Indiana University from 1961 until she retired as distinguished professor emeritus of history in 1993. During that time, she was the author or co-author of 17 books about Russia, the Balkans, and the Ottoman and Hapsburg empires. Some were written with her husband, Charles, also a professor emeritus of history at Indiana.         Her areas of expertise included Albania, Bulgaria, Turkey and Yugoslavia.         Born Barbara Brightfield in Belleville, Ill., she grew up in Berkeley, Calif. She received three degrees in history from the University of California at Berkeley, including, in 1948, a Ph.D. She started her academic career at Berkeley as a junior research historian at the Institute of Slavic Studies and a lecturer in history.         She joined the Indiana faculty as a lecturer in 1961 and by 1967 was a full professor in the history department.         Among her works currently in print are "History of the Balkans: 18th and 19th Centuries" (Cambridge University Press, 1983); "History of the Balkans: 20th Century" (Cambridge, 1983); "Russia and the Formation of the Romanian Empire" (Cambridge, 1984); "Modern Austria: Empire and Republic" (Cambridge, 1987); "Russia and the Rumanian National Cause" (Archon reprint, 1974), and "Russia's Balkan Entanglements, 1806-1914" (Cambridge, 1991).         Besides her husband, survivors include two sons, Mark, of Maryville, Mo., and Peter, of Austin, Tex., and two grandchildren.       
         Dr. Georgia B. Christopher, a professor of English at Emory University, died on Dec. 16 in DeKalb Medical Center in Decatur, Ga. She was 62 and lived in Decatur.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         She was the author of "Milton and the Science of the Saints" (Princeton University Press, 1983), for which she received the James Holly Hanford Award of the Milton Society of America. She also contributed frequently to journals of language and philology.         Born in Barnesville, Ga., she graduated from Agnes Scott College and earned her Ph.D. in English from Yale University. She taught at the University of North Carolina and the University of Richmond before joining the Emory faculty in 1981.         Dr. Christopher is survived by two brothers, John Christopher of Roswell, Ga., and Kent Christopher of Blairsville, Ga.       
         Aylin Radomisli-Cates, a psychiatrist who was the wife of the producer Joseph Cates, died on Jan. 17 in a car accident outside her home in Bedford Hills, N.Y. She was 57.         After graduating from the University of Lausanne in Switzerland, she became an assistant clinical professor at Cornell University Medical College. She entered the Army in 1992 as a lieutenant colonel to head the psychiatric service at Fort Sill, Okla. After two years in the Army, she returned to private practice, opening offices in Bedford Hills and Manhattan.         She was born in Istanbul, Turkey, and served for many years as a trustee of Roberts College, an English-language university there.         In 1987, she married Mr. Cates, a producer of Broadway shows and television programs. In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Nilufer Gulek, of Ankara, Turkey.       
         Dr. Mary Dwight B. McNair Scott, a biochemistry professor at the University of Pennsylvania who was a pioneer in the identification of the B complex of vitamins and their functions, died on Feb. 9 at the Hahnemann Hospital in Philadelphia, where she lived. She was 87.         The cause was a heart attack, said her husband, Dr. Thomas F. McNair Scott.         In 1935, while she was completing work at Harvard University for a doctorate in biochemistry, she became one of the first women appointed to the faculty of the Harvard Medical School as a research associate.         She married the following year and moved to England with her husband where she did research on the biochemistry of diabetes at the University College Medical School in London.         From 1943 to 1946, while on the faculty of Wellesley College, she conducted studies identifying N-methyl nicotinamide in urine which contributed to the discovery of the B complex vitamin, niacin.         After her husband completed his wartime service in England, the couple settled in Philadelphia, where she went to work for the University of Pennsylvania's Children's Hospital. From 1954 to 1965 she was in the School of Medicine's research medicine and physiology departments. In 1965 Dr. Scott moved to the School of Veterinary Medicine and retired in 1972.         Besides her husband, she is survived by a son, Robert, of Bern, Switzerland; a daughter, Carolyn Hoehn of Heidelberg, Germany; a sister, Helen Sutton Gulick of Sacramento, Calif., and four grandchildren.       
         Myra Pollack Sadker, a Washington educator and writer who charted sexual bias in the nation's classrooms, died on Saturday at Georgetown Medical Center. She was 52 and lived in Bethesda, Md.         The cause was complications from a bone marrow transplant for breast cancer, said a spokesman for American University, where she was a professor and former dean of the school of education.         Dr. Sadker's most recent work was "Failing at Fairness: How America's Schools Cheat Girls" (Scribners, 1994). It was written in collaboration with her husband, David M. Sadker, a fellow professor at American's school of education. The couple had first studied the subject of sexual bias when they were graduate students together.         With a decade's worth of research, "Failing at Fairness" sought to document that girls' educations were inferior to those of boys. The reason, the authors concluded, was the conscious or subconscious sexism of teachers who spend more time interacting with boys.         Teachers, according to the book, call on boys more, make more substantive comments on their work, and praise and goad them more. The result is that over time girls tend to lose self-esteem and do more poorly in standardized tests.         Dr. Sadker's research was widely reported in newspapers and magazines around the country. It also led to many invitations for her to appear on national television and radio programs.         Myra Pollack Sadker was born in Portland, Me., and graduated from Boston University. She received a master's degree at Harvard University and a doctorate in education at the University of Massachusetts. She taught at junior and senior high schools in Massachusetts and Thailand before joining the faculty of American University in 1973.         In graduate school, the Sadkers noticed that there seemed to be subtle differences in the education they received in the same classrooms and studying the same books. The experience started them in their career as a husband-and-wife team examining sexual bias in schools through research based on transcripts of classroom interactions, textbooks, surveys and polls.         Dr. Sadker was the author or co-author of six books and scores of articles on sexism, teacher education and children's books. Her work was recognized this year with the Eleanor Roosevelt Award of the American Association of University Women.         In addition to her husband, Dr. Sadker is survived by two daughters, Robin and Jacqueline; a brother, Dr. Murray Pollack of Potomac, Md., and her father, Louis Pollack of Boca Raton, Fla.       
         Vivian Verdell Gordon, who wrote about feminism, black families and affirmative action and who was a professor of black studies at the State University at Albany, died on Wednesday at St. Peter's Hospital in Albany. She was 60 and lived in Albany.         The cause was amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Lou Gehrig's disease, said a friend, Lois Smith Owens.         She was the author of 10 books and several articles, a former chairwoman of the department of Africana studies at the university and a poet. Her collection "Dark Women and Others" (Lotus Press, 1983) was published under the name Satiafa.         Born in Washington, she received an undergraduate degree from Virginia State University in 1955, a master's degree in sociology from the University of Pennsylvania in 1957 and a Ph.D. in sociology from the University of Virginia in 1974.         In the 1960's, she worked in Washington for the Library of Congress and the House Committee on Education and Labor. She also worked with the Women's Christian Alliance Child Welfare Agency and the Upward Bound Project in California before she began teaching at the University of Virginia in 1971. She was head of the university's black studies program from 1974 to 1979.         Her book "Black Women, Feminism and Black Liberation" (Third World Press, 1985) described the conflict that black women face over the issues of feminism and racism.         Her marriage to Ronald Gordon ended in divorce. She is survived by a son, Ronald Jr., of Atlanta; a brother, Thomas, and a daughter, Susan Akkad, both of New York City.       
         Dr. Lorella Margaret Jones, a science educator and physicist known for her work in theoretical high-energy physics, died on Feb. 9 in a nursing home in Champaign, Ill. She was 51 and lived in Urbana, Ill.         The cause was cancer, said colleagues at the physics department at the University of Illinois, where Dr. Jones was active as a professor of physics until a month ago.         Dr. Jones served as director of the university's computer-based Education Research Laboratory from 1992 until last year. Her research centered on the experimental results involving the force holding together nuclear particles and the little bundles of energy called quarks.         She was born in Toronto, the daughter of an astronomer and an industrial physicist. She earned a degree in mathematics at Harvard College and received her doctorate in physics at the California Institute of Technology.         Aside from research sabbaticals in Britain, Germany, Japan and Tasmania, she spent her academic career at the University of Illinois. She joined the faculty as an assistant professor in 1968 and became a tenured professor in 1978.         Her research resulted in 64 published papers. As a teacher, she also promoted the innovative use of computers in physics education and helped to develop computerized quizzes for elementary physics courses.         Dr. Jones is survived by her parents, Donald and Shirley Jones of Urbana, and a sister, Irene Jones of Livermore, Calif.       
         Norma Fields Furst, the president of Baltimore Hebrew University for the last three years, died on March 7 at her home in Wynnewood, Pa. She was 64.         The cause was lung cancer, her family said.         She was associated with Temple University from 1963 to 1983 in various positions, including full professor and finally dean of student affairs. She then was president of Harcum Junior College in Bryn Mawr, Pa., before joining Baltimore Hebrew in 1992.         She was active in many national and local organizations, including International B'nai B'rith/Hillel Commission, the Jewish Publication Society, and the American Association of University Women.         A native of Brooklyn, Dr. Furst was a graduate of Brooklyn College and earned a master's degree in education and a doctorate in educational psychology at Temple.         She is survived by her husband, Dr. M. Lawrence Furst; a son, Merrick, of Pittsburgh; a daughter, Laura F. Jacobs of Merion, Pa.; her mother, Anne Platzer of Philadelphia, and four grandchildren.       
         Ludmilla B. Turkevich, an expert in Russian language and literature who was the first woman to teach at Princeton and then spent 18 years as chairwoman of the Russian department at Douglass College of Rutgers University, died on Friday at the Princeton Medical Center. She was 85 and lived at the Monroe retirement village in Jamesburg, N.J.         Her family said the cause of death was respiratory failure.         She had the academic credentials, including degrees from New York University and Bryn Mawr and a doctorate from Columbia. She had been speaking and reading Russian with an informed passion since she was a child and had added Spanish as a sub-specialty. And she had experience as a teacher at the University of Kansas and at Douglass College, in New Brunswick, N.J.         Yet if there had not been a war on in 1944, and if Princeton had not found itself without a single Russian teacher at a time when there was a sudden, almost panicky upsurge in interest in the Soviet Union, it is doubtful that the university would have allowed the former Ludmilla Buketoff of New Britain, Conn., to be more than a faculty wife, the bride of John Turkevich, a professor of chemistry.         Even after Princeton did allow her on the faculty in 1944, the university, which would wait a quarter-century more before admitting women as students, insisted on maintaining a certain distinction. During the 17 years Mrs. Turkevich taught Russian and Spanish literature and a popular course on the modern European novel, she was relegated to the position of lecturer, subject to annual contract renewals.         When Rutgers offered in 1961 to make her a full professor at Douglass, its women's division, she accepted, and spent the next 18 years dazzling students like her own daughter, Tamar Skvir, who recalled her mother yesterday as a mesmerizing lecturer who made Pushkin, Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy come alive.         Professor Turkevich, who also held research positions at the Institute for Advanced Study and the Center for Theological Inquiry at Princeton and served as the president of the American Association of Teachers of Slavic and Eastern European Languages, wrote widely on Russian literature.         Her books include "Cervantes in Russia" (1950), "Masterpieces in Russian Literature" (1964) and "Spanish Literature in Russia and the Soviet Union 1735-1964" (1967).         She and her husband were also instrumental in the translation and publication of the "Guide to Russian Scientific Literature" in the 1940's and wrote the textbook "Russian for the Scientist" (1959).         Professor Turkevich also served as a specialist in American education at the United States exhibit in Moscow in 1959.         In addition to her husband and her daughter Tamar, she is survived by another daughter, Marina Naumann of Norwich, Vt., and four grandchildren.       
         Margaret Avery Rowell, a cellist who was one of the country's best-known teachers of the instrument, died on April 21 at Kaiser Medical Center in Oakland, Calif. She was 94 and lived in Berkeley, Calif.         The cause was pneumonia, said her daughter-in-law, Barbara Rowell.         Mrs. Rowell taught for 14 years at the San Francisco Conservatory of Music, and was on the faculties of the University of California at Berkeley, Stanford University, Mills College and San Francisco State University.         Among her former students are Paul Tobias, a faculty member of the Mannes College of Music and the Manhattan School of Music, and Bonnie Hampton, the president of Chamber Music America and a member of the San Francisco Trio.         Her husband, Edward Z. Rowell, a speech and philosophy professor at the University of California, died in 1975. She is survived by a son, Galen, of Berkeley, two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
         Janet Mathews Fitchen, a cultural anthropologist who studied rural poverty in the United States, died on Saturday at her home in Ithaca, N.Y. She was 58.         The cause was a brain tumor, her family said.         Dr. Fitchen brought the eye of an anthropologist and her profession's ethnographic methodology to the field of rural sociology. A professor of anthropology, she was the chairwoman of the department of anthropology at Ithaca College.         She wrote "Poverty in Rural America: A Case Study" (Westview, 1981), which surveyed pockets of poverty in the vast stretches of forests and fields of upstate New York. "I call it northern Appalachia," she told a reporter in 1984. "It is poverty that has been entrenched."         Her latest book was "Endangered Spaces, Enduring Places: Change, Identity and Survival in Rural America" (Westview, 1991). It chronicled the demographic, social, cultural, economic and agricultural changes transforming the Northeast. Both books are in print.         More recently, she researched poverty in other regions as an associate of the Western Rural Development Center in Corvallis, Ore. She had accepted a faculty appointment in the department of rural sociology at Cornell University and had planned to leave Ithaca College, where she had been a faculty member since 1977, at the end of the semester.         Dr. Fitchen was born in Manhattan but grew up on her family's dairy farm in Brewster, attending a one-room school. She graduated from Vassar College and received a master's degree in anthropology from the University of Illinois.         She did field work with Oscar Lewis in a Mexican village and received her Ph.D. in anthropology from Cornell.         Dr. Fitchen is survived by her husband, Douglas B. Fitchen, a Cornell professor; a son, John H., of La Jolla, Calif.; and two daughters, Katherine F. Nisbet of Bozeman, Mont., and Sylvia Fitchen of Tucson, Ariz.
