         Barbara Howes, a poet who was one of five finalists for the National Book Award in poetry last year for her book "Collected Poems 1945-1990," died in her  sleep early yesterday at the Southwestern Vermont Medical Center in Bennington,  Vt. She was 81 and lived on a farm in Pownal, Vt.         She died after a long illness, said her son Gregory Jay Smith.         Miss Howes, who was also a short-story writer, essayist, translator and editor, was the author of eight books of poetry and was a finalist for the poetry award in two earlier years.         Her "Collected Poems 1945-1990" (University of Arkansas Press, 1995) was praised in December by Robert Richman, the poetry editor of The New Criterion, in a review in The New York Times Book Review.         He applauded her "formal adeptness and lyric skill" and her "ability to sketch domestic scenes," but he said her "real calling card" was her knack for "extreme-but-just" metaphors. He called them reminiscent of the English poet John Donne and others of the group of 17th-century English lyric poets known as  the metaphysical poets.         In one poem in the 1995 collection, "The Lost Girl," Miss Howes likened a field to a decade. In another, she described a cat as "mysterious as gauze."         That collection also contains the following lines, which Miss Howes wrote in  praise of the intellect, and which led Mr. Richman to write that "few celebrate mind better":         Mind has mattered so much, and knowledge         Is bottomless as the golden bowl         In the myth, ceaseless as light, grave,         Unemptiable as the sea. . . .         To know, to understand         Has been my passion and addiction.         Miss Howes was born in New York, adopted into a well-to-do Massachusetts family and reared chiefly in a suburb of Boston, Chestnut Hill, where she attended Beaver Country Day School. She graduated from Bennington College in Vermont in 1937. While she was a student, she sought, and learned, the identity  of her natural parents and found that her ancestors included Anne Bradstreet, the 17th-century American poet.         After college, Miss Howes worked briefly for the Southern Tenant Farmers Union in Mississippi and then lived in Greenwich Village and edited a literary magazine, Chimera, from 1943 to 1947.         In 1947 she married the poet William Jay Smith, and the couple lived for a time in England and Italy. They divorced in the mid-1960's, and she lived in Pownal for the rest of her life. For the past three decades, she mainly lived a  secluded life on her farm.         She did spend time in the Caribbean though, and she edited two anthologies of writings by authors from lands to the south of the United States: "From the Green Antilles: Writings of the Caribbean" (1966) and "The Eye of the Heart: Short Stories From Latin America" (Avon, 1973).         Jorge Luis Borges, the Argentine poet, critic and short-story writer who died in 1986, said of "The Eye of the Heart," "All the important writers are there, and the stories are all good."         Miss Howes also wrote "The Road Commissioner and Other Stories" (1983). Her other poetry books are "The Undersea Farmer" (1948), "In the Cold Country" (1954), "Light and Dark" (University Press of New England, 1959), "Looking up at Leaves" (1966), "The Blue Garden" (University Press of New England, 1972), "A Private Signal: Poems New and Selected" (1977) and "Moving" (Elysian, 1983).         Looking at her work, the poet Richard Wilbur said not long ago, "Some of her  poems have the tartness of up-country New England, yet she can speak fantastically, to evoke the fantastic clamors of New York; and in many a southerly poem, she speaks, for our pleasure, the tongue of pure felicity."         In addition to her son Gregory, of Pownal, Miss Howes is survived by another  son, David Smith of Manhattan and a sister, Priscilla Howes Grant of Middlebury, Vt.       
         Katrina de Hirsch, a speech therapist who was a pioneer in the field of childhood language and learning disorders, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 93.         Ms. de Hirsch, who was better known by her professional name than her legal name, Katherine Romney, was among the first researchers to call attention to the varied deficiencies that make up speech and learning disabilities.         In the mid-1960's, long before interest in dyslexia, stuttering and similar  problems became widespread, Ms. de Hirsch was writing articles for professional  journals on these topics, said Dr. Jeannette Jansky, a colleague for many years.         Ms. de Hirsch maintained a private practice in New York City and was director of the Pediatric Language Disorder Clinic at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center from 1941 to 1972. One colleague described her as a master clinician who  achieved insights into children based not only on formal testing but on observations of a child's personality and an estimation of the relationships with family and friends.         "She was a pioneer," Dr. Jansky said. "The whole field of learning disabilities did not exist when she started her practice. When she started her work, the fields of reading disorders and language disorders were not connected. But she always said reading disorders had their base in language.         "Children with delayed language development had problems with reading when they got older. Once we had polished off their language problems, they came back in a year or two with reading disorders. She came to believe that the problems were rooted in architectural differences in the cortex."         The two women devised an index to predict whether a kindergarten pupil was likely to succeed in school or to need remedial work. It formed the basis for their first book, "Predicting Reading Failure" (1966, Harper & Row), written with Dr. William Langford. A second book, "Preventing Reading Failure" (1972, Harper & Row), refined the process and focused on intervention.         In her clinical work, Ms. de Hirsch put into practice the idea that both children and their parents needed to be educated about the needs of learning-disabled pupils.         "She explained to the parents why the children were having the problems they  were having," Dr. Jansky said. "If a child misread an easy word, it looked like  carelessness. But she explained that they didn't see it. She taught them tolerance and parental support rather than criticism. The emphasis in diagnosis  was always to highlight the children's often very special talents."         In addition to her private practice, Ms. de Hirsch carried out research and wrote extensively. She also trained pediatric and psychiatric residents to recognize language problems.         A life fellow of the American Orthopsychiatric Association, Ms. de Hirsch was an honoree of the Orton Society, named after Dr. Samuel Orton, an early mentor of Ms. de Hirsch. She was a founder of the society, now called the Orton Dyslexia Society. She was a fellow of the British College of Speech Therapy and  the American Speech-Language Hearing Association.         Born in Stuttgart, Germany, Ms. de Hirsch got her training at the West End Hospital for Nervous Diseases in London, where she received a degree from the College of Speech Therapy. In 1941, she came to the United States, where Teachers College of Columbia University awarded her a bachelor's degree.         She was married three times, and became a baroness by marrying her second husband, Donald von Hirsch.  Her third husband, Alfred Romney, whom she married  in 1948, died in 1977.         She is survived by two sons, Andrew von Hirsch of Cambridge, England, and Vinal Haven, Maine, and Frank Weil of Washington; two stepsons, Andrew Romney of Manhattan and Henry Romney of Remsenburg, L.I., and four grandchildren.       
         Anna Mikhailovna Larina, the widow of Nikolai I. Bukharin, a father of the Bolshevik Revolution who was executed under Stalin, and herself a survivor of the Soviet gulag, died of lung cancer here on Saturday, her daughter, Nadezhda Fadeyeva, said. She was 82.         When Bukharin, a trusted comrade of Lenin and a rival to Stalin, was condemned in 1938 in the last of the Moscow show trials, his young wife was banished and spent 20 years in exile and Soviet prison camps. Before they were separated, Bukharin instructed his wife to memorize his final testament, in which he implored future generations of Communist leaders to exonerate him. Not  daring to write it down, she later recalled, she used to lull herself to sleep in prison by repeating her husband's words silently to herself "like a prayer."  It was not published in full until 1988.         Miss Larina's autobiography, "This I Cannot Forget," created a sensation when it was published in Russia in 1988 as part of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's rehabilitation of Bukharin. But long before, while she was still in exile, Miss  Larina waged a tireless campaign to exonerate her husband after Stalin's death,  writing long, detailed letters to Nikita Khrushchev and his successors demanding Bukharin's reinstatement in the pantheon of revolutionary heroes.         Miss Larina's book was an instant best-seller. A harrowing prison memoir as well as a loving, uncritical tribute to Bukharin, it is also one of the few first-person accounts of repression and prison life by a fallen member of the Bolshevik ruling elite. Miss Larina was the adopted daughter of a leading Communist revolutionary, Yuri Larin, and grew up in the Metropole Hotel, the residence of many Soviet leaders, dandled on the knee of Lenin. She had known Bukharin, who was 25 years older than she and a friend of her father's, all her  life. She was 16 when they became engaged -- Stalin hand-delivered her first love letter to Bukharin -- and 20 when they married.         She was 24 when she was sent into exile and separated from their infant son,  Yuri, whom she did not see again until he was 20. The boy was passed around by relatives and later raised in a state orphanage. He only learned who his father  was in 1956, when he was allowed to visit his mother in exile. She was released  in 1959, and returned to Moscow with her second husband, Fyodor Fadeyev, a fellow prisoner she met in Siberia, and their two children.         Stephen F. Cohen, a Princeton University historian who published a biography  of Bukharin in 1973, met clandestinely with the widow during the Brezhnev era and became a close friend, discovering in the archives and returning to her the  last love letter Bukharin wrote to her, on Jan. 15, 1938, from prison. He was shot two months later.         Mr. Cohen described Miss Larina as "the last living link to the generation that made the revolution." He added that it was her remarkable personality that  cemented their friendship. "She lost everything," Mr. Cohen said, "but she showed no bitterness. She endured this horrible experience but it didn't deform  her psychologically. In 1988, she was able to resume public life in a way that astonished people."         After winning the campaign to rehabilitate her husband, Miss Larina devoted her last years to trying to recover Bukharin's long-hidden prison writings, philosophical essays, poems and also an autobiographical novel, which were unearthed from secret party archives in 1992. The novel is scheduled to be published in English by Columbia University Press later this year.         In addition to her daughter and her son Yuri Larin, Miss Larina is survived by her second son, Mikhail Fadeyev.       
         Esther S. Manz, who was a 208-pound housewife pregnant with her fifth child when a kitchen-table gathering in 1948 inspired her to found TOPS, a weight-loss support group that grew into a 300,000-member nonprofit organization, died on Monday at the Heritage Nursing Home in Milwaukee. Mrs. Manz, who made her home in Greenfield, Wis., a suburb of Milwaukee, was 88.         TOPS, which stands for Take Off Pounds Sensibly, draws its philosophy from something the 5-foot-2-inch Mrs. Manz, then 40, observed in group sessions intended to prepare women for childbirth: the power of mutual support in helping participants remain within their doctors' guidelines for weight.         TOPS members work out a sensible diet and weight goal with their physician and provide evidence of having consulted a doctor before attending weekly meetings that include a weigh-in and provide support and encouragement for members.         Men and women who achieve their weight goals become KOPS (Keep Off Pounds Sensibly), role models who are themselves reinforced in their efforts to maintain their weight by continuing to attend meetings.         "Life is a battle," Mrs. Manz once said. "Just let us win the one on obesity."         According to data from the weekly weigh-ins, TOPS members in 12,000 chapters  in the United States and abroad lost more than 740 tons last year, a spokeswoman said yesterday.         The nonprofit organization, based in Milwaukee, is supported by membership dues -- $16 in each of the first two years and $14 thereafter. When Mrs. Manz wrote TOPS's articles of incorporation in 1952, she committed it to finding a cure for obesity, and TOPS says it has contributed more than $4.5 million to obesity research.         After Mrs. Manz and three friends established their support group at her kitchen table in Milwaukee, the organization's name took its final form as the result of a newspaper article.         Mrs. Manz said she originally thought of it as TOP. "We didn't even have a name for our club at first, but when we went down to The Milwaukee Journal to be interviewed about our organization, the reporter asked what we called ourselves," she said in the group's handbook for new members. When the article was published, the name appeared as TOPS, and Mrs. Manz said it was later suggested that the S be made to stand for "sensibly."         On Jan. 21, 1948, the first meeting of TOPS was held at a Milwaukee community center. In the early days of the organization, Mrs. Manz carried a scale with her as she made her rounds as roving ambassador, organizing meetings.         Mrs. Manz, who achieved average proportions in her effort to control her weight, became president and chairwoman of the TOPS board in 1952. Declining health prompted her to relinquish the presidency in 1991, but she remained chairwoman until her death.         Born in 1907 in Plymouth, Wis., she grew up as Esther Schuland and graduated  in 1926 from Wisconsin State Teachers College. She taught at rural Wisconsin schools, married Gilbert Manz, a steelworker, in 1929 and later moved to Milwaukee, where she became a housewife.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Manz is survived by a son, Gilbert Jr.; four daughters, Bonnie Prieben, Maureen Weigert, Barbara Canapa and Marjory von Hof;  a brother, Carl Schuland, of Green Bay, Wis., 11 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren. All of Mrs. Manz's children live in Milwaukee except for Mrs. von Hof, a resident of Altura, Minn.       
         Audrey Meadows, whose portrayal of a working-class housewife on "The Honeymooners" placed her in the pantheon of television comedy's grandes dames, died on Saturday at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 71.         The cause was lung cancer, said her sister, the actress Jayne Meadows.         Audrey Meadows was the second actress to play Alice Kramden, whose bus driver husband, Ralph, threatened her weekly with a fist-propelled trip to the moon. "The Honeymooners" began in 1951 as part of "Cavalcade of Stars" with Pert Kelton as Alice. When it became part of "The Jackie Gleason Show" on CBS, Miss Meadows took over the role. "The Honeymooners" became a series on its own in 1955, and was initially something of a flop, running for only 39 episodes instead of the 70-plus that were planned. It was only later that the series, which is still being replayed on cable and airline flights, became what the television business calls a classic.         Miss Meadows's route to the role of Alice was decidedly circuitous. She was born in 1922 in China, where her father, Francis James Meadows Cotter, was an Episcopal minister. He brought the family back to the United States five years later and eventually become rector of Christ Church in Sharon, Conn.         Miss Meadows began her career as a coloratura soprano, making her concert debut at 16 in Carnegie Hall. It was her sister, Jayne, two years older, who steered her into acting.         Things moved quickly. After a World War II stint for the U.S.O. that included Mike Todd's production of "Mexican Hayride," Miss Meadows joined "The Bob and Ray Show" on NBC Television in 1951, playing all the female roles and ducking below the camera's eye to change costumes. At one point, she sang an opera aria  standing on her head.         In her spare time, she played the lead opposite Phil Silvers for 15 weeks in  the Broadway production of "Top Banana." And then she heard that Jackie Gleason, a hot new name in television, was looking for someone to replace Miss Kelton, who was ill, as Alice on his variety show.         The subsequent story is right out of the legends cherished in show business.  Gleason took one look at Miss Meadows and dismissed her as too young and too pretty. Hiring a photographer, she went home, washed off her makeup, got into a  frumpy housedress and sent the photos to Gleason, who hired her without even hearing her read lines.         During the life of "The Jackie Gleason Show," Miss Meadows appeared in different guises, including a sophisticated girlfriend of the character Reggie Van Gleason.         When Gleason decided he had had enough of an hourlong show every week, the pieces for a new half-hour show were in place: Gleason as Ralph Kramden; Miss Meadows as Alice; Art Carney as Ed Norton, and Joyce Randolph as his wife, Trixie.         No matter what else they did, each performer would forever after be fixed in  the public mind as the perfect embodiment of these hilarious and touching working-class characters whose problems seemed to connect with all of America. Each episode was a compact morality play. Ralph could keep on saying: "One of these days, Alice. Pow! Right in the kisser." But the audience knew he'd wind up admitting, "Baby you're the greatest!"         Miss Meadows held her own by remaining the calm sarcastic center around which the brilliant physical comedy of Gleason and Carney swirled. Listening to Ralph's harebrained get-rich schemes, Alice would stand with arms folded and eyes disdainful. More than once, Gleason publicly praised her ability to ad-lib  and keep the sketch on course. Once when Ralph burned himself and screamed, "Isn't there any lard around here," Miss Meadows simply took a long look at Gleason and said, "About 300 pounds of it."         The performance was perhaps too good. In a business notorious for typecasting, Miss Meadows quickly discovered that every producer wanted to keep  her in the kitchen. As recently as last year, in a New York Times interview with Bryan Miller, she lamented that she was lucky back then to get guest shots on the Dinah Shore and Red Skelton shows.         She virtually retired from acting after her 1961 marriage to Robert Six, the  chairman of Continental Airlines, turning her attention to business activities and her family. But she did have a recurring role as Ted Knight's mother-in-law  on the 1980's sitcom "Too Close for Comfort."         Mr. Six died in 1986.         Miss Meadows was adamant in her praise of Gleason, who died in 1987. After several less-than-flattering biographies were published about "The Great One," Miss Meadows wrote, with Joe Daly, her own "Love, Alice: My Life as a Honeymooner." She called the book, which was published last year, "a love letter...to my television husband Ralph Kramden."         Miss Meadows, a woman of loyalty and dignity, continued to be beset by autograph-seeking fans in restaurants and department stores. Alice had become a beloved fixture in American pop culture. People still wanted to tell her that  "Baby, you're the greatest."       
         Adele Bishop, who was instrumental in reviving the popularity of decorative stencils in the United States, died on Jan. 30 at Lenoir Memorial Hospital in Kinston, N.C. She was 68 and lived in Greenville, N.C.         The cause of death was complications from a bone marrow transplant while she  was being treated for cancer, said a son, Christian Carone.         Miss Bishop once hoped to become an opera singer. But stenciling, an early American art form, became the focus of her life in the 1950's after she read a book about it and began reproducing some designs at her home in East Hampton, L.I., where she lived with her first husband, Nicholas Carone, an artist.         From that start, she built a custom stenciling business, adding a partner, Cile Lord, in 1960. Together they produced stencil kits designed for do-it-yourselfers and wrote "The Art of Decorative Stenciling" (Viking, 1976), a book that was a standard reference work for many years.         After moving to Vermont in 1970 with her second husband, John Callaway, Miss  Bishop opened a mail-order company, American Decorative Arts Inc., a name changed later to Adele Bishop Inc. In 1984, Wall Lenk Corporation acquired the business and moved it to Kinston. Until her death, Miss Bishop remained active as a designer and consultant.         Miss Bishop was born in Washington, N.C., on Feb. 4, 1927. She studied voice  at the Juilliard School in New York, as well as in France and Italy.         Besides her son Christian, she is survived by her husband, Robert T. Paul of  Greenville, and another son, Claude Carone of Claverack, N.Y.       
         Jacquetta Hawkes, archeologist and author, who was the widow of the playwright and novelist J. B. Priestley, died on Monday at Cheltenham General Hospital in London. She was 85, and lived in the Cotswolds town of Chipping Camden.         In "Man on Earth," "A Land" and many other books, Ms. Hawkes searched for the humanity within science. She said, "Let us have the courage to accept the inner  experience that tells us we are something more and that we may be part of a process much greater still." Her fervent interest was in the world of prehistory.         Discovering a Neanderthal skeleton, she said: "I was conscious of this vanished being and myself as part of an unbroken stream of consciousness . . . With an imaginative effort it is possible to see the eternal present in which all days, all the seasons of the plain, stand in enduring unity." In her polymathic career, she was also a poet and novelist and, in collaboration with her husband, a playwright.         Reviewing "Time and the Priestleys, the Story of a Friendship," Diana Collins's 1994 double biography of Mr. Priestley and Ms. Hawkes, Peter Ackroyd said there was no reason Ms. Hawkes "should be remembered as the wife of anyone  . . . since her own story is as interesting and as compelling as that of Priestley himself."         That story began in her childhood when she dug in her family garden, which had once been part of an Anglo-Saxon cemetery. As Mr. Ackroyd said, "She discovered nothing, but found within herself a lasting treasure; it was her love of learning and her passion for the past." It was her goal in life "to retrieve  the landscapes of history."         Jacquetta Hopkins was born on Aug. 10, 1910, in Cambridge, which became the center of her early life. She graduated from the university with a degree in archeology and anthropology. In 1933, she married Christopher Hawkes, a professor of archeology, and they had a son, Nicolas. Her interest in archeology took her on expeditions to Palestine as well as England. During and immediately  after World War II, she held several government posts and was the founder of the United Kingdom Commission for Unesco.         Her 1951 book, "A Land" (with illustrations by Henry Moore), was based on her work as archeological adviser for the Festival of Britain. In his review in the  New York Times Book Review, Stanley Edgar Hyman said that Ms. Hawkes had told the "story of the shaping of the earth and the development of life with simple eloquence" and described "A Land" as "a triumph of skill as well as a work of love." Through the next 30 years Ms. Hawkes was a prolific author, writing bold  and often poetic books about archeology, geology and the history of mankind.         In 1947 she met Mr. Priestley at a Unesco conference in Mexico City. They were drawn together by the "magnetism of polarity," said Ms. Hawkes. She divorced Mr. Hawkes, and in 1953 married Mr. Priestley. It was his third marriage. She and Mr. Priestley collaborated on several projects, including the  play "Dragon's Mouth." When it was produced Off Broadway in 1955, Brooks Atkinson said in his review that the authors had "succeeded in writing a remarkably stimulating conversation" that was second only to Shaw's "Don Juan in Hell."         Ms. Hawkes's books included "A Woman as Great as the World," a collection of  fables and a science fiction novelette; "Journey Down a Rainbow," a personalized account of a visit to the United States written with Mr. Priestley; "Providence  Island: An Archeological Tale"; "King of the Two Lands: The Pharaoh, Akhenaten," and "Dawn of the Gods," a study of Greece in the Bronze Age. In the 1970's she wrote "The First Great Civilizations: Life in Mesopotamia, the Indus Valley and  Egypt," and atlases of ancient archeology and early human life. "A Quest for Love," in 1981, was an autobiographical novel.         Mr. Priestley died in 1984. Ms. Hawkes is survived by her son from her first  marriage.       
         Dr. Helene Wickham Koon, an author, scholar of 18th-century dramatic literature and former professor of English at California State University in San Bernardino, died on Feb. 13 at her home in Hollywood. She was 71.         The cause was emphysema, said Bernard P. Wiesen, a friend.         Dr. Koon was born in Minneapolis, and graduated from the University of Iowa. She pursued an earlier career as an actress, director and writer for theaters and radio stations in California and New Mexico. She opted for academia, however, and in 1969 earned a doctorate in English at the University of California in Los Angeles.         That year she joined the faculty of what was then California State College and was appointed a full professor in 1978. She also served as chairwoman of the department from 1975 to 1980.         Dr. Koon was the author of biographies of Colley Cibber, an English actor and dramatist (1671-1757), and Eugene Scribe, the French playwright (1791-1861). She also published "How Shakespeare Won the West," a study of Shakespearean stage productions during the Gold Rush, and "Dictionary of Gold Rush Performers, " among other books.         The author of numerous articles, she wrote poems and translated French literature and plays.         She is survived by her husband, Charles J. Koon; five sons, Christopher, Robin, Gavin, Nicholas and Lachlan; and six grandchildren.       
         Mary Lavin, whose short stories and novels about the conflicts in the hearts  of her fellow Irish men and women transcended mere tales of life in Ireland, died on Monday at a nursing home here. She was 83.         Ms. Lavin was the author of 19 collections of short stories and three novels. She won three Guggenheim Fellowships and a number of literary awards, including  the Katherine Mansfield Prize, in 1961. Her stories appeared regularly in The New Yorker.         Her death was front-page news in The Irish Times, whose chief book critic, Eileen Battersby, called her "one of modern Irish fiction's most subversive voices" and said, "Her art explored often brutal tensions, disappointments and frustrations dictating the relationships within so-called 'normal' families."         Ms. Lavin's favorite form was the short story, which she once likened to "a flash of lightning lighting up the whole landscape all at once." In a 1976 interview she was quoted as saying: "Publishers are definitely unfair to short-story writers. Since the essence of the short story is its conciseness, an addiction to change is an occupational disease and not the self-indulgence publishers think." She also said: "I don't think a story has to have a beginning, middle and end. I think of it more as an arrow in flight."         Critics often compared Ms. Lavin's work to that of other acclaimed Irish writers, including Liam O'Flaherty and Sean O'Faolain, and also perceived echoes of Balzac, Chekhov and Saki. Her writing influenced the work of others, as well, including the novelist William Trevor.         Ms. Lavin said her childhood reading of Jane Austen influenced her writing. She said that, as a realist, her writing was "only looking closer than normal into the human heart, whose vagaries and contrarieties have their own integral design." In an appreciation in The Irish Times, Maurice Harmon, professor emeritus of Anglo-Irish Literature at University College in Dublin, wrote: "She  drew upon her own experience. Her stories explore and reflect the patterns of her life: the return of the little girl from America to the strange, puritanical society of her mother's people" in Western Ireland.         "At the high point of her career," he continued, "she wrote about widows who  refuse to be passive in the face of death, who keep their memories of love and go forth to encounter experience with openness and with the wisdom of years."         Mary Lavin was born on June 11, 1912, of immigrant parents in East Walpole, Mass. When she was 10 the family moved back to Athenry, in Western Ireland. She  wrote her first short story in 1938. Her first collection, "Tales From Bective Bridge," won the James Tate Black Memorial Prize in 1942 and helped establish her career.         Her short-story collections include "The Long Ago" (1944), "The Becker Wives" (1946), "A Single Lady" (1957), "In the Middle of the Fields" (1966) and "The Shrine and Other Stories" (1976). She published her first novel, "The House in Clewe Street," in 1945; her second, "Mary O'Grady," appeared in 1950.         She served as president of the Irish Academy of Letters in 1971.         Ms. Lavin's first marriage was to William Walsh, a lawyer, who died in 1954.  They had three daughters, who survive. In 1969 she married Michael McDonald Scott, a former Roman Catholic priest, who died in 1990. In recent years her health failed and she lived in a nursing home.         Her stories were characterized by arresting opening and closing lines. One story, "Happiness," begins with "Mother had a lot to say" and ends: "Mother made the last effort of her life and grasped at Bea's meaning. She let out a sigh, and, closing her eyes, she sank back, and this time her head sank so deep into the pillow that it would have been dented had it been a pillow of stone." Another, "A Memory," begins, "James did all right for a man on his own," and ends, "Under a weight of bitterness too great to be borne, his face was pressed  into the wet leaves and, when he gulped for breath, the rotted leaves were sucked into his mouth."       
         Marguerite Duras, author of the best-selling novel "The Lover" and one of the most widely read French writers of the postwar era, died today at her home in Paris. She was 81.         Miss Duras, who was also a prolific playwright, film maker and screenwriter,  was best known for the way she used her early life in French Indochina as the inspiration for many of her works, including "The Lover," the story of her clandestine teen-age romance with a wealthy young Chinese man. Yet perhaps what  most characterized her 53-year literary career was her simple, terse writing style, as if language itself were merely a vehicle for conveying passion and desire, pain and despair. The mysteries of love and sex consumed her, but she had no room for sentimentality in her works, or indeed, in her life.         I write about love, yes, but not about tenderness," she said in a 1990 interview. "I don't like tender people. I myself am very harsh. When I love someone, I desire them. But tenderness supposes the exclusion of desire." Ever provocative in her use of language, she always bowed to the supremacy of words.  "Acting doesn't bring anything to a text," Miss Duras wrote of her work for cinema and theater. "On the contrary, it detracts from it -- lessens its immediacy and depth, weakens its muscles and dilutes its blood."         In the theater, this seemed to matter little, and her plays continue to be performed regularly in France. However, despite the enormous success of her screenplay for Alain Resnais's 1960 classic, "Hiroshima, Mon Amour," few of the  19 movies she wrote and directed herself did well, not least because words often entirely replaced action. Until her 70th birthday, her novels had a loyal  albeit small readership. With the publication of "The Lover" in 1984, however, Miss Duras reached a mass audience in France and abroad. The book sold more than two million copies and was made into a well-received film in 1992 by Jean-Jacques Annaud.         Because she considered her words to be sacrosanct, she often had stormy dealings with movie directors who adapted her novels, among them Peter Brook, Tony Richardson and Jules Dassin. And when Mr. Annaud altered her screenplay for "The Lover," Miss Duras broke with him and turned her text into yet another semi-autobiographical novel, "The Lover From Northern China." She described that book, published in 1991, as a "reappropriation" of "The Lover," yet once again she seemed to be reinventing her life to a point where it became impossible to know whether her original novel, Mr. Annaud's film or her second version of the  story was the closest to reality. To Miss Duras, of course, this did not matter.         She was born on April 4, 1914, in Gia Dinh, near Saigon. Her parents, Henri and Marie Donnadieu (she changed her name to Duras in the 1930's), were teachers in France's colonial service. She was only a child when her father died, and her first memories were of economic hardship, above all after her mother invested the family's savings in a disastrous rice-farming venture.         After attending school in Saigon, Miss Duras moved to France at the age of 18 to study law and political science. After graduation, she worked as a secretary  in the French Ministry of the Colonies until 1941, but by then Nazi Germany had  occupied France. In 1943, she joined the Resistance in a small group that included Francois Mitterrand, who remained a friend until his recent death.         In 1939, Miss Duras married the writer Robert Antelme, who was arrested and deported to Germany during the war. By the time he returned from Dachau concentration camp in 1945 (he was the subject of her 1985 book "La Douleur," later published in the United States as "The War"), she was already involved with Dionys Mascolo, who was to become her second husband and with whom she had  a son, Jean.         In the late 1940's, Miss Duras joined the French Communist Party, and though  she later resigned, she always described herself a Marxist. Yet perhaps her strongest political stance was her contempt for Gen. Charles de Gaulle. "He never pronounced the word Jew after the war," she said in the 1990 interview. "Many people think I am Jewish, and that always pleases me."         Her first book, "Les Impudents," was published in 1943, and from that time, she lived off her writing, gradually building a body of work that included more than 70 novels, plays, screenplays and adaptations. She eventually acquired a country home in Normandy, but her book-lined Left Bank apartment on the Rue St.-Benoit remained her Paris home from 1942 until her death.         For many years, she struggled with alcoholism -- a subject she frequently addressed in her writings -- and her health was further shattered by emphysema.  But in the 1980's, long separated from Mr. Mascolo, she also found love again in an unusual relationship with a young homosexual writer, Yann Andrea Steiner, with whom she shared her final years.         Late last year, struggling again with illness, Miss Duras published "That's All," a tiny 54-page book that seemed intended to be her literary adieu to her readers, to Mr. Steiner and to herself. Written between November 1994 and last August, with each occasional entry carrying a date, it consisted of poetic bursts of love, fear and despair, as if all too aware that her death was near.         The very last entry, on the afternoon of Aug. 1, 1995, read:         "I think it is all over. That my life is finished.         "I am no longer anything.         "I have become an appalling sight.         "I am falling apart.         "Come quickly.         "I no longer have a mouth, no longer a face."         She is survived by her son and Mr. Steiner.       
         M. Shanara Gilbert, an associate professor of law at the City University of New York Law School at Queens College, was killed on Tuesday in a highway accident in South Africa. She was 45 and lived in Brooklyn.         The accident, in which the school's former dean, W. Haywood Burns, also died, occurred when a truck ran a red light near Cape Town and struck the car in which they were riding, university officials said. They were attending a conference on democracy and international law.         Ms. Gilbert, a graduate of Syracuse University in political journalism, was  a founder and co-director of the City University Law School's Defender Clinic, a member of the board of directors of the National Conference of Black Lawyers and past chairwoman of the conference's Section on Criminal Justice. After receiving a J.D. degree from the University of Pennsylvania School of Law in 1980, she worked as a staff lawyer with the District of Columbia Public Defender Service and the Massachusetts Committee for Public Counsel Services.         Ms. Gilbert, who was born in Gap, Pa., worked for legal aid agencies well before becoming a lawyer, and was on the advisory board of the Neighborhood Defender Service of Harlem. In 1993, as a consultant to the Ford Foundation, she wrote a report on the status of university legal aid clinics in South Africa.         She is survived by her companion, Wayne Walcott, and two aunts, Alberta Davis of Newark and Mildred White of Philadelphia.       
         Erma Bombeck, who mined the everyday lives of housewives and parents for the  mother lode of humor that transformed her into one of the country's most popular newspaper columnists and a best-selling author, died yesterday at the University of California at San Francisco Medical Center. Mrs. Bombeck, who made her home in Paradise Valley, Ariz., a suburb of Phoenix, was 69.         Mrs. Bombeck, afflicted for years with polycystic kidney disease, a hereditary ailment, underwent a kidney transplant this month at the hospital, which said she died of complications after the surgery.         Three times a week until about two years ago, and more recently on a twice-weekly schedule, Mrs. Bombeck did what she had done since 1964: sifted greasy ovens, voracious washing machines, sibling rivalry and the predilections  of couch-potato spouses for the nuggets of mirth that won her the devotion of readers who followed her 500- to 600-word columns in some 600 newspapers.         "My type of humor is almost pure identification," she said. "A housewife reads my column and says, 'But that's happened to me! I know just what she's talking about!' "         Fans appreciated Mrs. Bombeck's slapstick approach to housekeeping and family relations.         *Dirty ovens: "If it won't catch fire today, clean it tomorrow."         *The dilemmas of sibling rivalry: "Who gets the fruit cocktail with the lone  cherry on top?"         *Affairs: "If a woman is ever to have an affair, it will be in March. Psychologically, it is a perfect month. The bowling tournaments are over. The white sales on bedding are past. Your chest cold has stabilized and the Avon lady is beginning to look like Tom Jones."         *Male habits: "If a man watches 16 consecutive quarters of football, he can be declared legally dead."         *Housework: "My second favorite household chore is ironing. My first being hitting my head on the top bunk bed until I faint."         *Teen-agers: "Don't ever say you understand them. It breaks down the hostile  relationship between you that it takes to understand one another."         Even at the pinnacle of success, earning $500,000 to $1 million a year, Mrs.  Bombeck made cleaning house, grocery shopping and cooking dinner a part of her weekly routine. "If I didn't do my own housework, then I have no business writing about it," she said. "I spend 90 percent of my time living scripts and 10 percent writing them."         Besides her columns, distributed at the time of her death by the Universal Press Syndicate in Kansas City, Mo., Mrs. Bombeck was the author of more than a  dozen books, including popular successes with titles like "The Grass Is Always Greener Over the Septic Tank" (1976), "If Life Is a Bowl of Cherries, What Am I  Doing in the Pits?" (1978) and "Motherhood: The Second Oldest Profession" (1983).         From 1975 to 1986 she appeared twice a week on "Good Morning America" on the  ABC network. At various times, she wrote a monthly column for Good Housekeeping, contributed to magazines like Reader's Digest, Family Circle, Redbook and McCall's; lectured; created, wrote and produced the short-lived 1981 ABC television series "Maggie" and saw "The Grass Is Always Greener" turned into a 1978 prime-time CBS television movie starring Carol Burnett as a concerned mother who was Mrs. Bombeck's alter ego and Charles Grodin as her husband.         In 1988, after her previous five books had sold more than 15 million copies,  she signed a three-book contract with Harper & Row valued by publishing experts  at $12 million.         Mrs. Bombeck was a housewife and mother, living outside Dayton in Centerville, Ohio, and advancing toward 40 when she determined to change her life.         "That's when I used to sit at the kitchen window, year after year, watching women like Ruth Gordon, Anne Morrow Lindbergh and Golda Meir carving out their own careers," she said. "I decided that it wasn't fulfilling to clean chrome faucets with a toothbrush. At 37, I decided it was my time to strike out.         In 1964, after the last of her three children started school, she began writing columns. She was, she said, "too old for a paper route, too young for Social Security and too tired for an affair."         Erma Louise Fiste was born Feb. 21, 1927, in Dayton. When she was 9, her father, a crane operator named Cassius Fiste, died of a heart attack at 42. "One day you were a family, living in a little house at the bottom of a hill," she said. "The next day it was all gone."         Mrs. Bombeck, who began writing a humor column at Emerson Junior High in Dayton, worked as a copy girl for The Dayton Journal-Herald after graduating from high school in 1944. She became a reporter there after graduating from the  University of Dayton with a bachelor of arts degree in 1949, the same year she married William Bombeck, a sportswriter who became a high school principal.         Mrs. Bombeck said she chose the subject of her columns because "being a housewife was the only thing in life I could discuss for more than 10 minutes."         She persuaded Ron Ginger, the editor of The Kettering-Oakwood Times, a suburban weekly, to pay her $3 a column, and she was on her way.         In 1992, Mrs. Bombeck underwent a mastectomy after cancer was diagnosed in a  breast, and not long afterward, as her kidneys failed, she began undergoing dialysis at her home.         In addition to her husband, who lives in Paradise Valley, and her mother, Erma Harris, of Sun City, Ariz., Mrs. Bombeck is survived by her three children: Betsy and Andrew, of Phoenix and Matthew, of Los Angeles.       
         Molly Keane, an Anglo-Irish novelist who had ridden to enough hounds, attended enough hunt balls and listened to enough below-stairs gossip by the time she was 17 to sustain two literary careers three decades apart, died on Monday at her cliffside home in Ardmore, County Waterford, Ireland. She was 91.         Although she was best known for her novel "Good Behavior," a finalist for the 1981 Booker Prize, its publication represented the resumption of a career she had abandoned after the death of her husband more than 30 years earlier.         It was a career that had been born and remained grounded in her childhood experiences.         Growing up in a grand home in County Wexford, where her Protestant English father was a noted fox hunter and her Irish mother was a lapsed poet and Italian literary scholar who wrote occasional reviews, was not entirely pleasant for Mrs. Kean.         But although her own sister once described her as an unloved child, her childhood served her well, providing the swirling fox-hunting background and social intrigue she drew on for more than a dozen novels and five plays.         An accomplished horsewoman herself, Mrs. Keane never apologized for her own youthful enchantment with a world circumscribed by riding, dancing and clothes.  Indeed, she began writing as a teen-ager, she once acknowledged, to supplement her dress allowance.         She also took the precaution of using a pseudonym, M. J. Farrell, a name she  spied on a board outside an Irish pub while riding home from a hunt.         "It would have been death to be known as a writer," she once explained.         Although the real identity of M. J. Farrell had long since become known in Irish and English literary circles, it was not until "Good Behavior" that Mrs. Keane, whose original name had been Mary Nesta Skrine, felt secure in publishing under a name of her own.         After the publication of "Good Behavior," her earlier works, including "Conversation Piece" and "Rising Tide," were reissued, and Mrs. Keane added two  further novels, "Time After Time," (Knopf, 1983) and "Loving and Giving," published in the United States by Dutton as "Queen Lear."         Mrs. Keane, who mined the same vein of childhood experiences time after time, inevitably found new nuggets of insight or intrigue. Unlike her earlier works, which she once suggested were written to portray a life she had wished for herself, her later novels had more bite, depicting the darker side of life among the disenfranchised Anglo-Irish gentry. ("Good Behavior" begins as the main character is genteely murdering her own mother.)         As a young adult, Mrs. Keane continued her childhood interest in parties and  gaiety, marrying a young Irishman, Bobby Keane, four years her junior, but only  after living with him for five years.         In her mid-30's she added plays to her repertory, writing five with John Perry, including "Spring Meeting," which was directed by John Gielgud in 1938 and provided Margaret Rutherford with her first starring role.         When she was 40, her husband died, and Mrs. Keane, who had two daughters, Sally and Virginia, was so grief-stricken she found she no longer had the zest for writing. She did manage to turn out two more novels, but with the exception  of a play that was panned in 1961, she wrote nothing until "Good Behavior" marked her return to form in 1981.         She is survived by her daughters.       
         P. L. Travers, who insisted she had never meant to write for children when the magical nanny Mary Poppins leaped from her pen, died on Tuesday at her home  in London. She was 96.         Miss Travers, a native of Australia who had lived in England since she was a  young woman, had been at various times in her life a poet, journalist, essayist, film and theater critic, dancer, Shakespearean actress and scholar of folklore and myth.         But she became renowned for "Mary Poppins," which, if not consciously intended for children, has been devoured by generations of them since its publication in 1934. The book, which has sold millions of copies and has been translated into more than 20 languages, has inspired critical studies, a string  of sequels and the 1964 Walt Disney movie musical, starring Julie Andrews and Dick Van Dyke.         "I think the idea of Mary Poppins has been blowing in and out of me, like a curtain at a window, all my life," Miss Travers said in 1964. The critic Richard Lingeman wrote that Miss Travers "has succeeded in creating a timeless world inhabited by real people and complete unto itself -- an immortal world that is summoned into being, unchanged whenever one opens a book."         A prolific writer who was still publishing well into her 80's, Miss Travers employed a precise, lyrical prose. Her entire body of work, whether for children or adults, is linked by a deep concern with myth and mysticism, a belief in the interconnectedness of human experience, and a ceaseless quest for meaning.         "Her great thing was E. M. Forster's wonderful phrase 'Only connect,' " Jenny Koralek, a children's writer and longtime friend, said by telephone from London  yesterday. "That is the key to her entirely: a wonderful ranging mind and heart, putting together the pieces of life."         A gracious observer of the English proprieties who at the same time did not suffer fools gladly, Miss Travers had deep blue eyes, high cheekbones and, as a  young woman, a cap of curly dark gold hair. Her likeness appears once, hidden in Mary Shepard's illustrations, in each of the many Mary Poppins books.         Miss Travers, who demonstrated the gravest consideration for children but often displayed a tart impatience with her adult interrogators, was taciturn to  the point of secrecy about the details of her personal life. Partly to render herself anonymous, she signed her work only with her initials instead of the name -- Pamela Lyndon Travers -- that she adopted when she went on the stage as  a young woman.         As a result of her fierce privacy, concrete information about Miss Travers's  life is often elusive. She frequently supplied interviewers with different renditions of events large and small, as if these variant accounts had arisen from the oral tradition that so often inspired her writing.         It is known that she was born Helen Lyndon Goff in Maryborough, Queensland, Australia, on Aug. 9, 1899, the eldest of three daughters of Robert and Margaret Goff. Her father was a sugar planter, and Miss Travers recalled growing up near  the Great Barrier Reef in a tropical world of sugar cane, shells and mangoes. Miss Travers's Irish father and her mother, an Australian of Scottish and Irish  descent, infused the household with the mystery and melancholy of the literary traditions of the British Isles.         "Many a phrase, as ordinary to me then as the daily porridge, began its life, as I later learned, as a quotation from a poem or snatch from a ballad," she once said.         A voracious reader, Miss Travers began writing stories as a young child. Her  principal influences, she later said, were fairy tales and the Bible. A formative event in Miss Travers's childhood was the death of her father when she was 7. She moved with her mother and sisters to New South Wales to live with a great-aunt, who years later would become the title character in Miss Travers's 1941 book, "Aunt Sass."         Throughout her writing life, Miss Travers retained the extraordinary ability  to tap into the private, wistful anguish of childhood, and often said that she viewed the passage from childhood to adulthood as a single unbroken thread. "The ideas I had then move about in me now," she once said, adding elsewhere that "sorrow lies like a heartbeat behind everything I have written."         Miss Travers began her acting career at 10, when she was cast in a professional production of "A Midsummer Night's Dream." As a teen-ager, she toured Australia with a Shakespearean company. She also worked as a dancer and journalist, and began publishing poetry. Sometime during this period she adopted the professional name Pamela Travers.         In 1924 Miss Travers left Australia for England, arriving with five pounds in her pocket. She soon began contributing poems to The Irish Statesman, a literary weekly whose editor, George William Russell, was the poet A. E. Through A. E., who became a mentor and lifelong friend, and through W. B. Yeats, to whom he introduced her, Miss Travers began to pursue the deep interest in Celtic folklore and Eastern mysticism that is palpable in all her subsequent work. Miss Travers also contributed film and theater criticism to the weekly The New English.         In 1934 Mary Poppins blew into Miss Travers's life and remained long enough to be captured on paper. Miss Travers was living in Sussex, recuperating from an illness in a 900-year-old thatched cottage mentioned in the Domesday Book. One day she found herself with two bored visiting children to entertain. She came up with a story about a raven-haired, rosy-cheeked governess who arrives with her carpetbag and parrot-headed umbrella at 17 Cherry Tree Lane to care for Jane and Michael Banks and their siblings. When Mary Poppins wasn't busy ruling the nursery with a will of iron, or admiring her own reflection in a shop window, she worked fabulous deeds: sliding up banisters, presiding at tea parties held on the ceiling, pasting gold paper stars in the heavens at night.         Encouraged by friends, Miss Travers published "Mary Poppins," which was an immediate critical success. A sequel, "Mary Poppins Comes Back," appeared the following year. It was followed by "Mary Poppins Opens the Door" (1943), "Mary Poppins in the Park" (1952), "Mary Poppins From A to Z" (1962), "Mary Poppins in Cherry Tree Lane" (1982) and "Mary Poppins and the House Next Door (1988).         "Nothing I had written before 'Mary Poppins' had anything to do with children, and I have always assumed, when I thought about it at all, that she had come out of the same wall of nothingness as the poetry, myth and legend that had absorbed me all my writing life," she wrote in 1978.         Although the Mary Poppins books were set permanently in the London of the 1930's, the Disney film was transposed to Edwardian times at Miss Travers's suggestion to give it a period sensibility. But despite her collaboration, Miss  Travers expressed dissatisfaction with the finished product.         "I think I was disturbed at seeing it so externalized, so oversimplified, so  generalized," she said in a 1967 interview. "I think that 'Mary Poppins' needs a subtle reader, in many respects, to grasp all its implications, and I understand that these cannot be translated in terms of the film."         After the outbreak of World War II, Miss Travers spent the years from 1940 to 1945 in the United States. Her experience became the basis for her 1941 book "I  Go by Sea, I Go by Land," the fictional diary of an 11-year-old girl who, like Miss Travers, was evacuated from England. The author would later return to the United States as a writer in residence at Radcliffe College in 1965 and at Smith College the following year.         In the decades after the war, Miss Travers continued to write. From 1976 on she was a consulting editor of the New York-based journal Parabola, which is devoted to the scholarly exploration of myth and tradition. Ms. Travers's books  during these years include "Friend Monkey," a 1971 retelling of the Hindu myth of the monkey lord Hanuman, a 1973 biography of the Russian mystic G. I. Gurdjieff, "About the Sleeping Beauty" (1975), a critical exploration of the fairy tale, and "What the Bee Knows" (1989), a collection of her Parabola pieces.         Miss Travers became the subject of public controversy in the early 1980's after "Mary Poppins" was banned from the San Francisco Public Library because of concerns over its treatment of members of minority groups. Of particular concern was the chapter entitled "Bad Tuesday," in which Mary Poppins and her charges travel to exotic corners of the world, meeting, among other characters, a black  woman on a South Sea island who holds a "pickaninny" on her lap, speaks in an American Southern dialect and offers everyone watermelon.         She rewrote the chapter for the 1981 revised edition of the book, substituting exotic animals for the offending ethnic characters. But in her public comments about making the revisions, she adopted a somewhat defensive tone. "I have done so not as an apology for anything I have written," she said.  "The reason is much more simple: I do not wish to see Mary Poppins tucked away in a closet."         In recent years, as her health began to decline, Miss Travers was confined increasingly to her home, a white Georgian town house with a bright pink front door in London's Chelsea section. Although she had previously stated that she looked forward to her old age, when she could sit in her rocking chair knowing all the answers, she grew incensed when a reporter for The New York Times asked  her about it in a 1994 interview. "But here I am sitting in my chair, and I don't think I'm going to know all the answers," she shouted. "I'm human."         Miss Travers, who never married, is survived by an adopted son, Camillus Travers of London, and three grandchildren.       
         Ilka Tanya Payan, the Dominican-born soap opera star and New York civic leader who played a reluctant but eloquent role in raising AIDS awareness after  disclosing that she was infected with the H.I.V. virus, died on Saturday at her  home in Manhattan. She was 53.         A friend, Carla Fine, said the cause was AIDS.         Although she won wide popularity with her portrayal of the villainous Carmen Delia in the Spanish-language television soap opera "Angelica, Mi Vida" ("Angelica, My Life"), Ms. Payan, who came to New York in 1956 and had appeared  in Spanish-language theatrical productions in New York and elsewhere, had already moved onto a broader stage by the time she made her startling announcement in 1993.         Fearing she would not be able to support herself as an actress indefinitely,  she had become a lawyer in 1981 and had begun a practice in immigration law that drew her increasingly into public affairs, partly because of a column on immigration matters she wrote for El Diario La Prensa.         By 1992, she had become so prominent in Hispanic political and civic circles  that Mayor David N. Dinkins named her to the city's Commission on Human Rights,  a position she relinquished when Mr. Dinkins left office.         When she held a news conference in October 1993, to disclose that she was H.I.V.-positive, her announcement sent shock waves through much of Latin America, particularly the Dominican Republic and Puerto Rico.         That was partly, she said, because there was such ignorance about AIDS among  the Hispanic populations, and such a stigma associated with the disease, that few Hispanic performers with H.I.V. had been willing to risk public disgrace by  acknowledging their infections.         It was precisely for those reasons, Ms. Payan said, that she had kept her own infection a secret for seven years. The virus, she said, had been detected in her system in 1986, five years after she had been infected by a lover who was an intravenous drug user.         "I wasn't ready to take on H.I.V. and society's rejection," she said, noting  that she had spent years working as a staff lawyer for Gay Men's Health Crisis not because of her own infection but because of the many friends in the theater  who had died of AIDS.         It was a measure of the degree of social rejection of people with AIDS that her own three sisters stopped talking to her after she made her announcement. In response, Ms. Payan assigned herself as a messenger of enlightment.         "My message is, 'Look at me,' " she said in 1993. "I'm a relatively healthy woman. Why must I be looked on as a pariah? I won't accept it."         And she did not. As a spokeswoman for the battle against AIDS, Ms. Payan made numerous public appearances and was widely interviewed by Spanish-language news  organizations.         She also received numerous awards for her work, among them a Medal of Honor presented to her by President Joaquin Balaguer of the Dominican Republic.         For Ms. Payan, however, there was a more cherished sign that her message was  getting through: since her announcement in 1993, her friend Ms. Fine said yesterday, her three sisters had reconciled with her.         Ms. Payan, who was divorced, is survived by her daughter, Genevieve Gabrielle Gazon of Manhattan, and her sisters, Luisia Payan of Manhattan, Marva Payan of Orange City, Fla., and Lil Palau of Kailua-Kona, Hawaii.       
         Frances Frenaye, a veteran American translator of French and Italian literary works into English, died on Friday at her apartment in Miami Beach. She was 88.         Earlier, Miss Frenaye lived for some 50 years in Manhattan, where she was employed, from 1963 to 1980, by the Italian Cultural Institute and edited its newsletter.         Over the years she also translated writings by scores of French and Italian  authors, including Balzac, Carlo Levi and Ignazio Silone. And she translated the writing of Elie Wiesel, who was born in Romania, from French.         According to Herbert Mitgang, an author and former New York Times book critic, the most notable aspect of her work was an ability to combine clarity and eloquence. "She didn't confine herself to literal translation," he said, "but also succeeded in capturing both the sense and the spirit of the author's intention."         An award jury that included Henri Peyre of Yale University chose Miss Frenaye to receive the 1951 Denyse Clairouin Memorial Award for distinguished translation of French into English for her renderings of the books "The Plunderers," by Georges Blond, and "Renee," by J. H. R. Lenormand.         Other books she translated included "Christ Stopped at Eboli" (1948), by Carlo Levi; "The Road to the City," by Natalia Ginzburg (1952), and "Little Misunderstandings of No Importance" (1985), by Antonio Tabucchi.         Miss Frenaye was also a freelance critic, and she appreciated -- though sometimes grudgingly -- esprit and individualism in people as well as in literature. Applauding a 1956 work, "Wingless Victory," about Gabriele d'Annunzio, the Italian poet, novelist and dramatist, and his mistress, the actress Eleonora Duse, Miss Frenaye wrote in The New York Times Book Review that the book's author, Frances Winwar, "in her spirited and lush re-creation of the  posing poet, has done well to present him in his own terms."         "Perhaps, in our iron age," Miss Frenaye added, "there is something to be said for flaming lives and for individual rather than mass aberration."         Miss Frenaye was born in Lawrence, L.I., into a family of remote French origin. She graduated from the Shipley School in Bryn Mawr, Pa., and in 1930 from Bryn Mawr College. She then spent six years in Europe, mostly in Paris and  Rome.         In 1939 she married Angelo Lanza di Trabia, a Sicilian, and afterward she used the surname Lanza in her personal life, although not in her work. During World War II she was a Washington-based official of the Justice Department. In Manhattan, after the war, she wrote a column for an Italian newspaper, Il Mondo, for a time.         Miss Frenaye and her husband separated in 1961, when he moved back to Italy.  He died in 1978.         She is survived by a daughter, Bianca Lanza of Miami, and a grandson.       
         Dr. Henriette R. Klein, clinical professor emeritus of psychiatry at Columbia University and a pioneer in the study of childhood schizophrenia, died on May 11 at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 94.         She researched, taught and practiced psychiatry for six decades and was associated with Columbia's College of Physicians and Surgeons as a special lecturer until 1993. She was the first woman to be elected president of the Association for Psychoanalytic Medicine and the first female member and president of the New York Psychiatric Society.         Dr. Klein was known for her direct style, her no-nonsense professionalism and the breadth of her interests. She was born in Evanston, Ill., and graduated  from the University of Chicago in 1924. She received her medical degree from the University of Maryland in 1932 and trained at the New York Psychoanalytic Institute from 1935 to 1940.         With her mentor, Dr. Howard W. Potter, she was co-author of a ground-breaking study in 1937 on diagnosing childhood schizophrenia. She and Dr. Potter also experimented with outpatient services for a child-care agency, a harbinger of community psychiatry.         Another focus of her work was the training of psychiatrists at Columbia's Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research, which she joined in 1949. She studied the effects of psychoanalysis on the patient, a subject she repeatedly wrote about.         She took part in a study, "Anxiety in Pregnancy and Childbirth" (1950), which debunked the received wisdom that having a baby was an answer to unhappiness. Instead, the study found that having a child can aggravate underlying disturbances in women who are severely maladjusted or mentally ill.         With her husband, Dr. William A. Horwitz, a professor of psychiatry at Columbia, she explored the mechanisms of paranoia and helped broaden the dynamic explanations of that disorder. She also had a private psychiatric practice in Manhattan.         Dr. Klein organized psychiatric training centers at Emory University, New York University and the Long Island College of Medicine, which became the Downstate Medical Center of the State University of New York.         Among her professional concerns were the confidentiality of patients' records, the disciplining of psychiatrists who engage in sexual relations with patients and the discouraging of long-term analysis by older psychiatrists likely to die before the patient.         Dr. Klein is survived by a daughter, Dr. Susan Harris Molnar of Scarborough,  N.Y.; a son, William Harris of Pacific Palisades, Calif., and three grandchildren. Her husband died in 1968.       
         Josephine DeNatale Butler, a dance educator, historian and author, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 85.         Mrs. Butler and her husband, Albert Butler, wrote "The Encyclopedia of Social Dance." She was also the founder and president of the Institute for Social Dance Studies in New York, dedicated to the preservation and documentation of the history of American social dancing.         In 1970, Mrs. Butler created the film, print and memorabilia archive of American social ballroom dancing at the dance division of the Lincoln Center Library for the Performing Arts. For 50 years, she was the director of the Albert Butler School of Dance, which she and her husband founded in 1936.         The Butlers were a popular ballroom dance team for many years, performing in  Manhattan at the Ritz-Carlton, the Plaza and other hotels, as well as in Europe.         Mrs. Butler was born in New York City in 1911. Before taking up dance, she was a fashion consultant and high-fashion designer. She was a past president of  the International Dance Council and Dance Masters of America.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Mary Perot Nichols, the strong-willed former head of the television and radio stations operated by New York City, and a former columnist and city editor of The Village Voice, died yesterday in the hospice of the Cabrini Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 69.         She died of pancreatic cancer, her family said.         A friend and ally of Edward I. Koch, the former Mayor, for 40 years, Ms. Nichols twice served as president of the WNYC Communications Group, with two radio stations, WNYC-AM and WNYC-FM, and a television station, WNYC-TV, Channel  31, licensed and partly financed by the city.         Ms. Nichols's most lasting professional contribution may have been the creation of the WNYC Foundation in the late 1970's, founded to attract private funds so the communications group could survive despite dwindling city financing. The foundation is awaiting approval from the Federal Communications Commission to buy WNYC-AM and FM, which are to remain public stations. Last week, the F.C.C. cleared the way for the city to sell the commercial license for WNYC-TV to the ITT Corporation and Dow Jones, which plan to create a sports, financial and entertainment superstation.         Under Ms. Nichols's leadership, the radio station became an important contributor to the city's cultural life and a major producer of programs for National Public Radio, including "Kids America," a live call-in program for children that won several broadcasting awards.         Mayor Koch first appointed Ms. Nichols to head WNYC Communications in 1978 on the heels of the city's fiscal crisis, when budget-conscious politicians called  for sale of the stations. She not only kept them going but also began station renovations.         When she resigned after two years to become director of communications at the University of Pennsylvania, she tossed off a tart farewell: doing creative work  for the city-owned stations was, she said, "a little like trying to cook a gourmet meal with glue on the kitchen floor."         Ms. Nichols left WNYC because of a disagreement with Mayor Koch when he insisted that the radio station run "The John Hour," in which the names of nine  men convicted of patronizing prostitutes were read over WNYC-AM. Mr. Koch theorized that the embarrassing exposure would cut into the prostitution trade and also argued that the Mayor should be allowed to control programming. "The John Hour" ran only once, but there was an outcry, and Ms. Nichols was made "uncomfortable," Mr. Koch said.         But he wooed her back to lead the communications group from 1983 to 1990, when Mayor David N. Dinkins replaced her with his own choice. She then became a  visiting professor of journalism at New York University, a post she held until her death.         Born in York, Pa., Mary Perot grew up near Philadelphia and in Buffalo. Friends say her Main Line family offered her a choice: she could have a "coming-out tea" or a college education. She selected college and in 1948 graduated from Swarthmore College with a degree in political science.         She lived with her husband and three children in Greenwich Village, and was involved in local issues, particularly the effort to stop Robert Moses from putting a road through Washington Square Park. She kept nudging Dan Wolf, a founding editor of The Village Voice, to write about the park. He encouraged her to write about the danger to the park herself, and she did.         Soon she became a mainstay of the young newspaper, first as a reporter, then  as author of "Runnin' Scared," a column about city politics.         A competitive writer with a streak of indignation -- "Mary had the kind of anger that made abolitionists," said a former colleague, Jerry Tallmer, the writer -- she wrote extensively about organized crime and political corruption and was among the loudest critics of the Lower Manhattan Expressway and then Westway. Neither was built.         "Mary had spies everywhere," said Clark Whelton, a former Voice reporter who  is now a speechwriter for Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani. "She seemed to know things  other people never found out. She would do the legwork herself, sit through long meetings, read documents nobody else would read, make connections nobody else would make."         Before she left the paper for good in the mid-1970's, she took two years off  to serve as a public relations aide in the city's Parks Department. It was a heady time, during Mayor John V. Lindsay's first term, and the energetic Parks Commissioner, Thomas P. F. Hoving, staged happenings -- concerts and other events to draw the public to the once placid parks.         "In the revolution of 1966, Mary was a key player," said Henry Stern, the current Commissioner of the Parks Department who was then its executive director. "Hoving was brand new to city government, but she knew all about it. He got the nickname Thomas P. F. Hoving, P. F. for Publicity Forever, but Mary Nichols made it happen."         Ms. Nichols soon grew disillusioned with Mr. Hoving and Mr. Lindsay, who became one of many favorite targets in her columns once she returned to The Voice in 1968.         As The Voice's city editor, she encouraged young writers and seemed to thrive on feuds with politicians and colleagues. Some accused her of trying to promote  the interests of Mr. Koch, her old friend. She acknowledged that she often agreed with him, but asserted that "when I disagreed with him, I let him have it."         Shortly after The Voice's founders sold it in the mid-1970's, a new editor dismissed Ms. Nichols. In 1977, she became communications director to Mayor Kevin S. White of Boston for just under a year. Then, after Mr. Koch's election  that year, she took on the WNYC job.         Ms. Nichols's marriage to Robert B. Nichols, a writer, ended in divorce.         She is survived by two daughters, Eliza Nichols of Williamsburg, Va., and Kerstin Nichols of Hartford, Vt.; a son, Duncan, of Thetford, Vt.; a brother, Charles Perot, and two grandchildren.       
         Shelley List, a novelist and a producer of the television series "Cagney and  Lacey," died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 65 and lived in Venice, Calif.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, Jonathan Estrin, who was also her longtime business partner.         Ms. List was born in Manhattan. She earned a bachelor's degree in literature from Reed College in 1951 and a master's degree in literature from Teachers College of Columbia University in 1952. In the 1960's she reviewed theater for the Westport News in Westport, Conn., and wrote feature articles for the Fairpress in Fairfield, Conn.         After writing the novels "Did You Love Daddy When I Was Born?" (1972) and "Nobody Makes Me Cry" (1975), Ms. List moved to California to try her hand at television writing. She sold her first treatment, which was made into the 1979 movie "And Baby Makes Six," with Colleen Dewhurst. Ms. List wrote the script.         Beginning in the 1980's, she and her husband created, wrote and produced the  mini-series "Between Friends," which was based on Ms. List's novel "Nobody Makes Me Cry"; "Daniel Steele's 'Jewels,' " "Amazing Grace" and "Barbara Taylor Bradford's 'Remember.' " Other television credits include the situation comedy "City," with Valerie Harper, and the pilot episode of "Sisters."         From 1986 to 1988, Ms. List and her husband were the supervising producers of "Cagney and Lacey, " a role they assumed when the original producer of the series, Terry Louise Fischer, left to develop "L.A. Law." They wrote the second  part of a two-episode drama in which Lacey recognizes and deals with her alcoholism.         Her first marriage, to Murray List, ended in divorce.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Julie List Faggella and Abigail List, both of Manhattan; two brothers, Peter Steinmann and  Daniel Steinmann; a stepson, Zachary Estrin, and a grandson.         Correction:         An obituary on Thursday about Shelley List, a television producer, misidentified the character who struggled with alcoholism in an episode of "Cagney and Lacey" written by Ms. List and her husband, Jonathan Estrin. The character was Cagney, not Lacey.

         Eugenia Price, who turned a chance visit to coastal Georgia into a career as  the South's most popular writer of antebellum romantic fiction, died on Tuesday  at a hospital in Brunswick, Ga., not far from her home in St. Simons, the island she made famous through a series of novels. She was 79.         Her companion, Joyce Blackburn, said the cause was congestive heart failure.         Her hoop-skirted heroines tended to be too unremittingly beautiful, her handsome heroes a shade too dashing and their problems a bit too easily solved for Ms. Price to have won serious literary acclaim. But then again, how many acclaimed authors sell more than 40 million books in 18 languages?         That Ms. Price did just that was a tribute both to her ability as a storyteller and her knack for recreating a bygone era with such compelling and authentic historic detail that, according to the St. Simons's Chamber of Commerce, a substantial majority of the thousands of tourists who visit the island each year come there specifically to scout out the houses, marshes and other locales she used in her novels, not to mention the headstones of the actual people she brought back to life as fictional characters.         Ms. Price, a dentist's daughter from Charleston, W.Va., was a precocious student who entered Ohio University at 16 and later studied dentistry at Northwestern University before dropping out of school to pursue a writing career.         Those familiar with the intensely romantic themes of her fiction would not be surprised that she began her career writing soap operas, initially in Chicago and later in New York and Cincinnati, the headquarters of Procter & Gamble.         An intense conversion to Christianity in the late 1940's altered the course of her life and of her writing. Abandoning soap operas, she began turning out inspirational books -- among them "Discoveries," "Beloved World" and "The Eugenia Price Treasury of Faith" -- that won her a wide following long before she turned to fiction.         Indeed, it was while on a tour in 1960 to promote one of her two dozen inspirational titles that she and Ms. Blackburn, who had been living in Chicago, happened to stop off in St. Simons and were so enchanted by the beauty and ambiance of the place that they decided they never wanted to leave.         It was a measure of their immediate and intense devotion to the island that the two women bought cemetery plots there before they built the house they named Dodge after the real St. Simons clergyman who, with his two wives, became the focus of Ms. Price's first novels, "Lighthouse," "New Moon Rising" and "Beloved  Invader."         Those books were such a succcess that she wrote a Florida Trilogy and a Savannah Quartet before a turning out a final Georgia Trilogy, whose return to the familiar St. Simons settings helped propel the first book of the final series, "Bright Captivity" (1991), to The New York Times best-seller list. The third, "Beauty from Ashes" (1995), was also a best seller. Her last book, "The Waiting Time," is to be published next year by Doubleday.         Ms. Blackburn, a writer who subsumed her own career to serve as Ms. Price's live-in editor, is her only survivor.       
         Tamara Toumanova, a child-prodigy ballerina of the 1930's who became familiar to American audiences as one of the most glamorous stars of 20th-century dance,  died on Wednesday at the Santa Monica Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 77 and lived in Beverly Hills.         She died after a brief illness, said John Taras, a friend.         By the time she was 13, Miss Toumanova was internationally acclaimed as one  of the three so-called baby ballerinas of Col. W. de Basil's Ballets Russes. She and two other phenomenally gifted daughters of Russian emigres -- Irina Baronova and Tatiana Riabouchinska -- were discovered in Parisian ballet studios by George Balanchine. They soon became the talk of London and New York.         Adoring fans nicknamed Miss Toumanova "the black pearl of the Russian ballet." Even as a teen-ager, her beauty was as remarkable as her technique. Kathrine Sorley Walker, a British dance historian, said of her in "De Basil's Ballets Russes" (1983) that with her "large dark eyes, raven wings of hair and magnolia skin, she combined lyricism and virtuosity to a remarkable degree."         A founding member of the de Basil Ballets Russes in 1932, Miss Toumanova inspired two of this century's greatest choreographers. She created roles in Balanchine's "Cotillon" and "Concurrence" and in Leonide Massine's "Jeux d'Enfants" with the company. She left the following year and was given starring  roles by Balanchine in his short-lived troupe Les Ballets 1933. Returning to the Ballets Russes a few months afterward, she danced in the classics as well as in  such new works by Massine as "Choreartium" and "Symphonie Fantastique." Later in her career, she performed with Ballet Theater, now American Ballet Theater, and appeared in a number of Hollywood films.         Miss Toumanova was born on March 2, 1919, in a boxcar in Siberia. She was the daughter of a czarist army colonel and his wife, who were fleeing the Bolsheviks. The couple settled in Paris, where their daughter became a pupil of  Olga Preobrajenska, a Russian-born teacher.         Miss Toumanova astonished balletgoers in 1929, at the age of 9, when she appeared at the Paris Opera in "L'Eventail de Jeanne," a ballet with a cast of children. Reviewing the production in the theatrical magazine Comoedia, Andre Levinson, the most famous Parisian ballet critic of the time, called Miss Toumanova's dancing both "astonishing" and "frightening."         When quarrels between de Basil and Massine prompted the choreographer to form his own company, Miss Toumanova became a member of Massine's new Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo in 1938. She dropped out of the company the next year to appear in the Broadway musical "Stars in Your Eyes," and rejoined de Basil's company for an Australian tour and the New York season that followed it in 1940. She was once again a member of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo from 1940 to 1942, and during the 1944-45 season, was a star of Ballet Theater.         As she toured the world, Miss Toumanova was accompanied by her mother, Eugenia, one of the most famous of the "ballet mothers" of the 1930's. These mothers went everywhere with their daughters, serving as dressers, laundresses,  cooks and pet keepers. In addition, the mothers were their daughters' fiercest partisans and sternest critics. Eugenia Toumanova was also said to be fond of fortune telling, faith healing and poker playing.         When, as a member of the Ballet Russe de Monte Carlo, Miss Toumanova was cast in the virtuosic Black Swan pas de deux from "Swan Lake," she and her mother would minutely inspect the stage to choose the spot at which the ballerina would perform a notoriously difficult series of whipping turns known as fouettes. Then they would pray over that spot. The fouettes never faltered. Grace Robert, an American dance historian, said of the Black Swan in her "Borzoi Book of Ballets" (1946): "Tamara Toumanova is at her exciting best in this tour de force, its vertiginous turns and sustained balances exactly suiting her temperament and forceful technique."         Miss Toumanova's later career, although a distinguished one, did not always seem as remarkable as her youthful achievements. After leaving Ballet Theater, she became a freelance ballerina, appearing with such companies as the Paris Opera Ballet, London Festival Ballet and the Marquis de Cuevas Grand Ballet. During the 1960's, she toured extensively in South America with Vladimir Oukhtomsky as her partner.         She created two notable roles with the Paris Opera Ballet. In 1947, she was a star of "Le Palais de Cristal," the glittering abstract ballet by Balanchine that is known in America as "Symphony in C." Three years later, she displayed her dramatic talents in the title role of Serge Lifar's "Phedre."         Some critics thought Miss Toumanova acquired annoying mannerisms. Reviewing her in the London Festival Ballet production of "Swan Lake" in 1955, John Martin, who was then the dance critic of The New York Times, complained that "her grandiosity (including some incredible bows) smothered the whole work like  so much thick chocolate sauce."         Nevertheless, she remained capable of extraordinary performances. Seeing her  at the Paris Opera in 1950, the American critic Edward Denby wrote in "Dancers,  Buildings and People in the Streets" (1965) that he was distressed by her "careless feet, limp and wormy arms, brutally deformed phrasings" but that his objections vanished when she offered "a few terrifying extensions, a few incisive strokes that counted phenomenally."         "At these moments," he went on, "she had so much vitality she made everyone else look as if they merely crept or scuttled about her while she danced."         Miss Toumanova acted and danced in several movies. She made her screen debut  in "Days of Glory" in 1944. That same year, she married the film's producer and  screen writer, Casey Robinson; the marriage ended in divorce. Miss Toumanova played the ballerina Anna Pavlova in "Tonight We Sing" in 1953 and appeared in "Deep in My Heart" in 1954. She had a starring role in "Invitation to the Dance," a ballet film directed by Gene Kelly in 1955. She was also in Alfred Hitchcock's "Torn Curtain" (1966) and Billy Wilder's "Private Life of Sherlock Holmes" (1969).         Miss Toumanova, who became an American citizen in 1944, lived quietly in later years at her home in Beverly Hills.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Patsy Montana, whose yodeling-cowgirl songs made her a pioneer in country music, died on Friday at her home in San Jacinto, Calif., The Associated Press reported. She was 81.         Ms. Montana had her biggest hit, "I Want to Be a Cowboy's Sweetheart," in 1935, the first million-selling hit for a female country singer. It brought an assertive female voice to country music, as she announced her readiness to "rope and ride" and sang whooping high notes. Ms. Montana remained active for a career that lasted six decades.         Ms. Montana, who original name was Rubye Blevins, was born in Hot Springs, Ark., in 1914, and grew up in Hope, Ark., hearing the music of Jimmie Rodgers, country's "blue yodeler." She moved to California in 1930 with an older brother, and began performing on radio there after winning a talent contest. She joined the revue of a well-known country singer, Stuart Hamblen, in 1931, working with  a group called the Montana Cowgirls; Hamblen renamed her Patsy. She made her first recordings as Patsy Montana in 1932, and in 1933 she moved to Chicago to perform on WLS radio with the Prairie Ramblers.         She appeared regularly on the "National Barn Dance" program and recorded for  the American Record Corporation, usually accompanied by the Ramblers; she relocated with them to WOR radio in Manhattan in 1935. Along with "I Want to Be  a Cowboy's Sweetheart," which she wrote, her hits included "Shy Anne from Old Cheyenne," "The She Buckaroo," "Rodeo Sweetheart" and "I Wanna Be a Western Cowgirl." In 1939, she appeared with Gene Autry in the movie "Colorado Sunset."         During the 1940's, she recorded with the Sons of the Pioneers and the Light Crust Doughboys, and had a hit with "Goodnight, Soldier" during World War II. She returned to Arkansas in 1948, performing on radio there and at the Saturday-night "Louisiana Hayride" in Shreveport, La. When her husband, Paul Rose, was transferred to California, the family moved to the West Coast, and Ms. Montana went into temporary retirement during the 1950's.         But she returned to touring in the 1960's. In 1964, she made an album with a  band that included Waylon Jennings, little known at the time, on lead guitar. In the 1970's and 80's, she made albums for folk and bluegrass labels like Birch, Old Homestead and Flying Fish.         She is survived by her husband; a daughter, Beverly Losey, both of San Jacinto, and two brothers, Ira Blevins of Mena, Ark., and Kenneth Blevins of Florida.       
         Marjorie Gross, a writer and producer of the television series "Seinfeld," who also wrote a humorous article about her ovarian cancer in The New Yorker in  April, died of the illness on June 7 at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. She was 40.         Ms. Gross was born in Toronto and got her start doing stand-up comedy in local clubs. She moved to New York City, where she was one of a group of female  stand-up comedians, who were then a relative rarity, performing at Catch a Rising Star, the Comic Strip and the Improvisation.         In 1981, Ms. Gross broke into television as a writer for the sitcom "Square  Pegs," with Sarah Jessica Parker. She also appeared on "Late Show With David Letterman." Then in 1994, she joined two old friends, Jerry Seinfeld and Larry David, as a writer for "Seinfeld."         Even after her ovarian cancer was diagnosed two and a half years ago, Ms. Gross kept working. "Jerry put a cot in her office for her so she could lie down," her brother Jonathan said.         Among the "Seinfeld" shows Ms. Gross wrote, with Peter Mehlman, was the shower head episode, which was rebroadcast on Thursday. The episode was an extended riff on the drawbacks of environmentally approved low-flow shower heads. One by one, the show's characters made their appearance with flattened hair because their showers lacked enough pressure to rinse out shampoo.         In her New Yorker article about having ovarian cancer, a disease that killed  her mother, Ms. Gross made the illness sound like nothing more than a vast practical joke. In the piece, titled "Cancer Becomes Me," she made light of some of the darker aspects of her illness, noting the way doctors tend to use different analogies when describing tumors in women and men. "They found a tumor that they said was the size of an orange," she wrote. "See, for women they use the citrus fruit comparison; for men it's sporting goods: Oh, it's the size of a softball, or in England, a cricket ball."         She listed some "advantages" to being sick, including, "You automatically get called courageous," and, "Everyone returns your calls immediately: having cancer is like being Mike Ovitz."         Besides her brother, of Toronto, she is survived by her father, Jules Gross,  and another brother, Adam, both of whom also live in Toronto.       
         Jan Kerouac, a novelist and the only child of the Beat Generation's icon Jack Kerouac, died on Wednesday at Lovelace Medical Center here. She was 44.         Ms. Kerouac died a day after her spleen was removed. She had suffered kidney  failure five years ago and had been on dialysis, said Gerald Nicosia, her father's biographer.         Ms. Kerouac, who had met her father only twice -- when she was 9 and when she was 15 -- had fought in recent years to gain control of his archives. In 1994, she sued relatives of Mr. Kerouac's last wife, Stella Sampas, who inherited the notebooks, teletype rolls and parchment scrolls on which he wrote  "On the Road" and laid down the first rumblings of postwar alienation that set the tone for the Beat Generation of the 1950's.         Ms. Kerouac argued that the will of Mr. Kerouac's mother, Gabrielle Kerouac,  which left her son's effects to Stella Sampas, was a forgery. Had Mrs. Kerouac died without a will, the estate would have gone to her two grandchildren, Jan Kerouac and Paul Blake Jr. Jack Kerouac died in 1969.         Ms. Kerouac's lawyer said a trial was tentatively set for September in St. Petersburg, Fla.         "Her main intent was to put it into a museum or a library and preserve it forever," Mr. Nicosia, the biographer, said.         Ms. Kerouac had also tried to have her father's remains moved from Lowell, Mass., where he was born and reared, to Nashua, N.H., where the Kerouacs have a  family plot. That effort failed.         Ms. Kerouac's first novel, "Baby Driver," was published in 1981. It dealt with her childhood on the Lower East Side of Manhattan during the turbulent 1960's. Her second, "Trainsong" (1988), was about her travels after the first book.         She had been working on "Parrot Fever," about the death of her mother, Joan Haverty, in 1991. She was Mr. Kerouac's second wife.         Ms. Kerouac's parents were estranged when she was born. The author denied being her father until she was 9, when he took a blood test and then acknowledged her as his daughter.       
         Sophia Delza Glassgold, a modern dancer and teacher and an expert in the ancient Chinese exercise form called tai chi, died on June 27 at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan.         She was 92 and lived in Manhattan.         A graduate of Hunter College, she trained as a modern dancer and toured the  United States performing Spanish and modern dance during the 1920's.         She also performed with her sister, Elizabeth, in the late 1920's at the Neighborhood Playhouse.         She lived in Shanghai from 1948 to 1951 and was the first American dancer to  teach modern dance in Chinese theater and dance schools.         Ms. Delza also became an expert on Chinese theatrical dancing after studying  action dance roles in the classical Chinese theater with Wang Fu-Ying and Cheng  Chuan-Chien.  She gave lectures and dance recitals on the material throughout the United States.         She founded the Delza School of Tai Chi Chuan at Carnegie Hall in 1954 and later taught at schools including the State University of New York at Purchase,  the Actor's Studio and the University of Hawaii.         She also taught and lectured on tai chi in live appearances and on television, writing the first book in English on the subject.         Her writings on esthetics, dance and theater arts and exercise and health have been published in China, in Europe and in American journals that include Dance Observer, the Theater Drama Review and the Journal of Aesthetics and Art Criticism.         Ms. Delza also published a record album on teaching tai chi and wrote four books on tai chi and modern dance, including "The Tai Chi Chuan Experience," published this year by the State University of New York Press.         Ms. Delza's husband, A. Cook Glassgold, an official of the Joint Distribution Committee in Shanghai and the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Agency, died in 1985.         She is survived by her sister, of Manhattan.       
         Justice Birdie Amsterdam, who achieved several judicial firsts, including being the first woman elected to the New York State Supreme Court, died on Monday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 95 and lived on the Lower East Side, just steps from where she was born.         Justice Amsterdam came to be called the "first lady of the judiciary" by her  peers and other admirers, a sobriquet earned during 35 years on the bench.         She was the first woman elected to the Municipal Court in New York County in 1940. She was active in the Democratic Party, but when she was up for re-election in 1949, she carried the endorsements of all three parties, all bar  associations, the Citizens' Union and the American Federation of Labor.         In 1954, she was appointed Acting Justice of the City Court, another first for a woman, and won election to the office the next year.         In 1958, she gained the Supreme Court bench as a Democrat-Liberal, supported  again by a long roster of civic, communal, educational, labor, scientific, philanthropic and religious groups. She served until 1975.         Chief Judge Judith S. Kaye, the first woman on the Court of Appeals in Albany, the state's highest tribunal, recalled Justice Amsterdam's trailblazing  achievements in a 1991 article in the New York Law Journal.         The State Supreme Court was more than 250 years old before a woman was elected to it, Judge Kaye wrote, and even today women do not enjoy the status of equals in the legal profession. "Thoughts of Justice Amsterdam's arrival on the  New York State Supreme Court serve to remind of us both of how far we have advanced toward these objectives and how much they continue to elude us," she wrote.         Justice Amsterdam was one of six children of Joseph Amsterdam, a band leader  from Austria. At 12, she taught English to foreign-born neighbors. Growing up in a neighborhood of immigrants and the poor awakened a commitment to social issues that guided her life as a lawyer. Her concerns ranged from playgrounds to summer camps, from slum clearance to shelter for the aged and the infirm, and from medical care to tuition assistance that could give a student a leg up. One of her special interests was the advancement of women in the legal profession.         She graduated on a state scholarship from Hunter College High School at 17. Waiting to meet the age requirement for admission to New York University Law School, she spent a year studying economics, banking and accounting at City College. She took evening classes at N.Y.U. and held a full-time job at Mount Sinai Hospital, keeping records and accounts.         Once she received her law degree in 1922, Mount Sinai doctors helped her practice by steering friends her way. She swiftly established a reputation not only as a skillful lawyer but also as an eloquent friend of the downtrodden, a champion of women's rights and a diligent party worker. She became a Tammany Hall district co-leader on the East Side.         Justice Amsterdam was honored by scores of organizations. "Who's Who of American Women" named her outstanding woman of the year for 1960 in the legal field, citing her "pre-eminent attainments and the inspiration they offer to other women in your profession."         Justice Amsterdam is survived by a sister and brother-in-law, Cynthia and Judge Milton Sanders, with whom she shared a home on Second Avenue for 59 years, as well as another sister, Sybil Chizner of Hollywood, Fla.         Correction:  July 11, 1996, Thursday         An obituary yesterday of Justice Birdie Amsterdam, the first woman elected to New York State Supreme Court, misstated the given name of a surviving sister. She is Ruth Sanders, not Cynthia.       
         Peg Weiss, an art historian, research professor and leading scholar on the Russian modernist Wassily Kandinsky, died on Wednesday at her home in Syracuse.  She was 63.         The cause was cancer, her husband, Volker Weiss, said.         In 1982, Mrs. Weiss was the curator of "Kandinsky in Munich" at the Solomon  R. Guggenheim Museum. She also wrote three books on the artist: "Kandinsky and Old Russia: The Artist as Ethnographer and Shaman," (Yale University Press, 1995); "Kandinsky in Munich, 1896-1914," the catalogue for the Guggenheim exhibition, and "Kandinsky in Munich: The Formative Jugendstil Years," (Princeton University Press, 1979).         Besides being a research professor at Syracuse University, Mrs.  Weiss was also a Getty scholar from 1989 to 1990. Before that she was the chief curator of the Everson Museum of Art in Syracuse, from 1979 to 1980, and the curator of collections there from 1975 until 1979.         Mrs. Weiss was born in Denver and reared in Massachusetts. In 1950, she moved to Syracuse to study art history, earning her B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. degrees at Syracuse University. In 1956 she won a scholarship to study art history in Munich, and it was there that she became interested in Kandinsky's life and work.         She taught courses on modern art at colleges and universities across the country, including Cornell University and Columbia University. She was a guest curator at the Guggenheim Museum from 1979 until 1982.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Weiss is survived by two sons, Erick, of Los Angeles and Christopher, of Syracuse.       
         Jessica Mitford, whose book "The American Way of Death" won her enormous popularity as an irreverent muckraker and witty polemicist, died yesterday at her home in Oakland, Calif. She was 78.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter, Constancia Romilly.         Over the more than three decades that she wrote nonfiction, Miss Mitford railed against those who tried to suppress dissent over the Vietnam War, against a prison system she found to be corrupt and brutalizing, and against a medical profession she thought was greedy and given to unnecessary procedures. She even  exposed the odd doings of her sisters.         But it was "The American Way of Death," published in 1963, that made the British-born Miss Mitford a formidable literary figure in her adopted country. Near her death she was preparing a revision to be published next year by Alfred  A. Knopf.         The thesis of the book, a scathing indictment of the American funeral industry, was that undertakers had "successfully turned the tables in recent years to perpetrate a huge, macabre and expensive practical joke on the American public."         She explored the changing lexicon of death, in which undertakers had come to  call themselves "funeral directors" and "morticians," coffins had become "caskets," and hearses had become "professional cars." In the new order, she said, flowers were "floral tributes" and corpses were always called "loved ones." One of the results of all this, she said, was that the cost of dying was  rising faster than was the cost of living.         She told her readers unsettling things about their neighborhood undertakers,  much to the dismay of the trade, and at the end of the book included a list of medical schools that might have good use for a dead body. She felt strongly that someone's mortal remains would be better off studied by medical students than transformed into a profit center for those in the business of marketing and planning funerals.         The New Yorker hailed the book as a "brilliant journalistic case against the  whole funeral industry," and the work led to an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission. But not everyone was pleased. James B. Utt, then a Republican  Congressman from California, a state known for its Pharaonic funerals and ornate cemeteries, denounced Miss Mitford as "pro-Communist, anti-American." Mr. Utt said he suspected that profits from the book "no doubt will find their way into  the coffers of the Communist Party, U.S.A." Miss Mitford had been a Communist in the 1940's, an experience chronicled in her memoirs, but had quit the party.         Jessica Mitford was born on Sept. 11, 1917, at Batsford Mansion in Gloucestershire, England, one of seven children and the youngest daughter born to Lord Redesdale (David Mitford) and Lady Redesdale, the former Sydney Bowles.         It was by any measure a family given to eccentricity. One of Miss Mitford's five sisters, Pamela, aspired as a child to be a horse. Another, Diana, wanted to be a Fascist and succeeded in becoming the wife of Sir Oswald Mosley, the ranking leader of Britain's Fascists. Another daughter, Unity, went to Germany,  became a disciple of Hitler, shot herself and died nine years later in a nursing home.         Miss Mitford's eldest sister, Nancy, became a novelist, and is best remembered for "The Pursuit of Love" and "Love in a Cold Climate."         Miss Mitford described her childhood as largely unhappy. She particularly resented that she and her sisters were prevented from going to school because Lady Redesdale did not believe that girls needed it and tutored them at home.         Early in life, Miss Mitford shared a sitting room with her sister Unity, who  adorned it with swastikas. According to her memoirs, Miss Mitford responded by using a diamond ring to carve small hammers and sickles into the windowpanes on her side of the room.         When she was 19, she ran away from home with a second cousin, Esmond Romilly, a nephew of Winston Churchill. Because she eloped, she was cut out of her father's will. In 1939, Miss Mitford quit her job as a market researcher in the  London office of J. Walter Thompson and moved to the United States with her husband. He joined the Canadian Air Force after the war broke out and was killed in action in 1941.         Miss Mitford was a union organizer, a bartender at a Miami restaurant, a clerk in a Washington dress shop and a typist and later an investigator at the Office of Price Administration in World War II.         In 1943, she married Robert E. Treuhaft, a lawyer from Brooklyn, and the couple moved to Oakland, Calif. When Miss Mitford was 38, she decided that she would become a writer. She had largely failed at her other jobs, she wrote, and  "I figured that the only thing that requires no education and no skills is writing."         She produced her first book, "Life itselfmanship," in 1956. It was privately  published and had little circulation. Her second effort, "Daughters and Rebels," an autobiography, was published in 1960 and won praise from the critics. Her next book was "The American Way of Death," which remained on the best-seller list for a year.         Late in life, she was asked what sort of funeral she wanted. An elaborate one, she replied, with "six black horses with plumes and one of those marvelous  jobs of embalming that take 20 years off." She added that she wanted "streets to be blocked off, dignitaries to declaim sobbingly over the flower-smothered bier, proclamations to be issued -- that sort of thing."         Her other books attracted much attention, although none as much as "The American Way of Death." She also wrote "The Trial of Dr. Spock, William Sloan Coffin Jr., Michael Ferber, Mitchell Goodman and Marcus Raskin" (1969), five who were accused of aiding and abetting those who sought to violate the Selective Service Act. Among her other books were "Kind and Unusual Punishment: The Prison Business" (1973), a study of American prisons, which she found wanting in almost everything except brutality; "A Fine Old Conflict" (1977), a memoir of her Communist days; "Poison Penmanship: The Gentle Art of Muckraking" (1979), and "The American Way of Birth" (1992), in which she accused doctors of doing too many Caesarean sections and of not paying enough attention to the possibilities  offered by midwifery.         She also wrote articles for Life, Esquire, The Nation and The San Francisco Chronicle.         In addition to her daughter, of Manhattan, she is survived by her husband; a  son, Benjamin Treuhaft of Berkeley, Calif.; two sisters, Deborah Devonshire of Chatsworth, England, and Diana Mosley of Paris, and three grandchildren.         Correction:         An obituary of the writer Jessica Mitford on Wednesday omitted the titles of  her surviving sisters and misidentified the hometown of one. One sister is Deborah, Duchess of Devonshire. Her hometown is Bakewell, in Darbyshire; Chatsworth is the name of her house. The other sister is Lady Diana Mosley.         An obituary on July 24 about the writer Jessica Mitford misstated the relative ages of her and her sisters. Ms. Mitford was the second youngest of six daughters. Her sister Deborah was the youngest.       
         Claudia Cassidy, whose arts criticism for The Chicago Tribune made her a dominant figure in the city's cultural scene for decades, died on Sunday at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago. She was 96 and lived in Chicago.         Ms. Cassidy was born in Shawneetown, Ill., on the Ohio River, where she saw her first theatrical performances on showboats. She earned a bachelor's degree from the University of Illinois, where she studied journalism. In 1925 she became the music and drama critic for The Journal of Commerce after pinch-hitting for the regular critic when he fell ill.         In late 1941 she went to the newly founded Sun to organize its theater and music department. Less than a year later she was hired by The Tribune as its theater, music and ballet critic, and her "On the Aisle" column soon became a Chicago institution.         Ms. Cassidy wrote an energetic, often florid prose, and she took no prisoners. Sometimes referred to as "acidy Cassidy," she hounded the conductors  Desire Defauw, Rafael Kubelik and Jean Martinon off the podium of the Chicago Symphony and out of town, and her scathing denunciations of most visiting Broadway productions as sorry leftovers shipped out to the hinterlands made her  the scourge of New York producers. Some artists left the city vowing never to return.         She could also praise. She was a fervent partisan of the Lyric Opera, for example, and of the conductors Fritz Reiner and Eugene Ormandy. Her one-woman campaign in support of "The Glass Menagerie," which had its premiere in Chicago  in 1944, helped establish Tennessee Williams's career.         After 1965, Miss Cassidy did freelance work for The Tribune, Chicago magazine and, briefly, for Chicagoan magazine. She also did a weekly half-hour program of arts commentary on WFMT radio, from 1968 to 1983. The columns she wrote on her annual tour of European festivals were collected in "Europe on the Aisle" (1954).         No immediate family members survive.       
         Anne W. Simon, an environmentalist whose books explored the perils to the world's seas and shorelines, particularly on her beloved Martha's Vineyard, died on Monday at her Manhattan home. She was 82 and also had a home in Chilmark, Mass.         At her death she was working on a book on the changing nature of Martha's Vineyard and what might be done to save the island where she had summered for many years. An article based on its first chapter was published in the July issue of the monthly Martha's Vineyard Magazine.         The article echoed her earlier book, "No Island Is an Island: The Ordeal of  Martha's Vineyard" (1973). There she told the tale of how the Vineyard, after hundreds of years of slumber, surrendered to tract subdivisions, an explosion of second homes, sewage spillovers and traffic jams.         Another volume, "The Thin Edge: Coast and Man in Crisis" (1978), discussed the precarious state of dunes and beaches, wetlands and estuaries everywhere that economic development reaches them. "Neptune's Revenge: The Ocean of Tomorrow" (1984) was an unsparing critique of the environmental damage to oceans from oil spills, overfishing, the greenhouse effect and the dumping of sewage, toxins and radioactive waste.         Anne Wertheim was born in Cos Cob, Conn., and in 1935 graduated from Smith College, where she edited the campus newspaper. She earned a master's degree at  the School of Social Work of Columbia University.         She was a writer at radio station WNYC, became a television critic for The Nation and subsequently wrote for McCall's, Good Housekeeping and other periodicals. Her first book was "Stepchild in the Family: A View of Children in  Remarriage" (1964), a primer based on her own experience as a stepchild and as a stepparent.         She was married three times and had taken the surname of her last husband, Prof. Walter Werner, while keeping her pen name. He died in 1986. Her previous marriages, to Dr. Louis Langman and Robert Simon, ended in divorce.         She is survived by a son and three daughters from her first marriage: Thomas  Langman of Washington, Betsy L. Schulberg of Westhampton Beach, L.I., Lynn L. Lilienthal of Reston, Va., and Deborah L. Lesser of Berkeley, Calif., and 11 grandchildren.       
         Claudette Colbert, the versatile stage and film star whose flair for light comedy cheered audiences during the Depression and for decades afterward, died yesterday at Belle-rive, her home on the island of Barbados. She was 92 and also had a home in Manhattan.         Miss Colbert's wit, gaiety, cupid's-bow mouth and light touch took her from the Art Students League in New York to the height of stardom on Broadway and in  Hollywood. She is best remembered for screwball comedies in which, no matter what situation befell her, she usually managed to keep her aplomb and good humor. Her greatest triumph was playing a runaway heiress opposite Clark Gable's cynical reporter in Frank Capra's film comedy "It Happened One Night," a performance that won her an Academy Award as best actress in 1934.         She could appear worldly and sophisticated yet down to earth, a quality that, combined with attention to camera angles, lighting and other technical details, helped her to sustain a remarkably durable career encompassing more than 60 films and many stage appearances.         In 1981, in her seventh decade in show business, the New York Times critic Frank Rich, praising her performance in the Broadway flop "A Talent for Murder," called her "a lady of piquant, irrepressible, ever-so-amusing common sense." He  cited "her big Betty Boop eyes, curly light hair" and "her low, one-of-the-boys  voice, effortlessly hurling asides like pool balls into every pocket of the house."         "Audiences always sound like they're glad to see me, and I'm damned glad to see them," Miss Colbert told an interviewer in 1978. "If they want you, you want to do it. The feeling never dies."         From 'The Lady Lies' To the Milk of Asses         Miss Colbert had her first film success in 1929, as the heroine of the talkie "The Lady Lies." Her early notable films, all box-office hits, included "The Smiling Lieutenant" (1931), a wistful Ernst Lubitsch comedy; "The Sign of the Cross," a 1932 Cecil B. DeMille spectacular in which she played Nero's sensuous  empress Poppaea, and the 1934 production of "Cleopatra," in which she played the title role.         "The Sign of the Cross" included a memorable scene with Miss Colbert bathing  in what was described by the studio as asses' milk, a scene that became widely admired. The film historian David Thomson wrote six decades later that Miss Colbert had bathed not only in asses' milk but also in "the director's boyish lasciviousness."         Miss Colbert confided in a 1984 interview that the asses' milk was really made from a powdered product called Klim.         "That's 'milk' spelled backward," the star explained. "I was in the pool all  day. The Klim was so warm my bangs came uncurled. When the electricians turned off all the hot lights for an hour it congealed and the Klim turned to cream cheese."         Besides DeMille, directors of her films included George Cukor, John Ford, Gregory LaCava, Mervyn LeRoy and Anatole Litvak. Among her leading men were Maurice Chevalier, Gary Cooper, Joseph Cotten, Melvyn Douglas, Henry Fonda, Fred MacMurray, Fredric March, Ray Milland, Spencer Tracy, John Wayne and Orson Welles.         Her early films were followed by such successes as "Imitation of Life" (1934); "The Gilded Lily" (1935); "Private Worlds" (1935), a drama of a mental institution; "Bluebeard's Eighth Wife" (1938), another Lubitsch comedy; "Midnight" (1939); "The Palm Beach Story" (1942), a Preston Sturges caper, and "Since You Went Away" (1944), a drama of the American home front during World War II.         Her last artistically substantial movie role was as a married American woman  in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp in "Three Came Home" (1950). Her performance  was warmly praised by the critics, but the film did not fare well at the box office.         Through much of her movie career she was under contract to Paramount, although she was on loan to Columbia when she made "It Happened One Night." After 1950 her movie roles were largely vignettes. She made her last feature film, "Parrish," in 1961 but went before the cameras again in 1986 for a television movie, "The Two Mrs. Grenvilles."         Miss Colbert's most noteworthy stage vehicles included "The Barker" (1927), a box-office hit in which she played an alluring snake charmer; Eugene O'Neill's "Dynamo," which was produced by the Theater Guild in 1929 and won her considerable prestige, although it was not a popular success, and the fluffy comedy "The Marriage-Go-Round," a smash hit that opened in 1958 co-starring Charles Boyer, with whom she had also appeared in such films as "Private Worlds" (1935) and "Tovarich" (1937).         An important ingredient in her early success in the theater was her skill asa speaker. When talking films took hold and many silent-film stars turned out to have inadequate voices, she was taken on by Paramount.         "Hollywood was not my dream, you know," she said in an interview in 1978. "I  only left Broadway when the crash came. The Depression killed the theater, and the pictures were manna from heaven."         For many years, Miss Colbert was among the top-earning movie stars: some industry analysts calculated that she was the industry's best-paid star in 1938  and 1942. That made it even easier for her to clothe her 5-foot-4-inch frame ultra-fashionably, and for several years she was voted Hollywood's best-dressed  woman.         Despite her long identification with Hollywood, Miss Colbert's dramatic skills were versatile enough that she was among the few major film stars who managed repeatedly to return to the stage to critical acclaim.         Triumphant Returns To the Theater         Her first return to Broadway, after more than a quarter-century and the cooling of her movie career, came in the spring of 1956, when she replaced Margaret Sullavan during the spring and summer in the comedy "Janus." Appearances in other Broadway productions followed, including "The Marriage-Go-Round," and in 1963 she announced that she was bidding farewell to Hollywood for good.         Miss Colbert was born in Paris on Sept. 13, 1903, and was brought to this country as a child by her parents, Georges and Jeanne Loew Chauchoin. Her name was originally Lily Claudette Chauchoin. But she took the name Claudette Colbert (pronounced coal-BEAR) for her first Broadway role, an opening that resulted from an introduction to the playwright Anne Morrison at a tea party in New York  in 1923. Miss Colbert, who was studying at the Art Students League, jokingly suggested that Morrison give her a role in her next play. Morrison gave her a small one in "The Wild Westcotts."         "I just went right onstage, and I learned by watching," Miss Colbert said years later, noting that she had never taken acting lessons. "I've always believed that acting is instinct to start with; you either have it or you don't."         Broadway fame came quickly. In 1927 the young Leland Hayward, who would become a celebrated theatrical producer, told the director Frank Capra that Miss Colbert was "a real headline maker, the finest young actress that's hit Broadway in years."         Mr. Capra was soon directing the silent movie "For the Love of Mike," with Mr. Hayward in overall charge of production and Miss Colbert in the leading female role.         The movie, nade on a shoestring, was a flop. In his 1971 book "The Name Above the Title," Mr. Capra wrote that Miss Colbert, "never easily pleased, said that  for her it was a disaster, and vowed that it would be her first and last film."         Although she changed her mind, Miss Colbert was far from Mr. Capra's first choice for the female lead when he began preparing "It Happened One Night." First he approached Myrna Loy, who turned the part down. So did Margaret Sullavan. So did Miriam Hopkins. So did Constance Bennett.         Finally Harry Cohn, the head of Columbia Pictures, suggested Miss Colbert, who grudgingly took on the role. When the movie was being made, Mr. Capra reported, Miss Colbert proved to be firm yet engaging. For one intimate scene, he said: "Claudette refused to even partially undress before the camera. She wanted to feature her acting, not her sex appeal."         By the same token, she refused at first to raise her skirt for the subsequently famous hitchhiking scene, in which the script called for her to demonstrate that a display of leg could stop a motorist.         And so, Mr. Capra recalled: "We waited until the casting director sent us a chorus girl with shapely underpinnings to 'double' for Colbert's. When she saw the double's leg, she said: 'Get her out of here. I'll do it. That's not my leg!' "         During the filming, Mr. Capra asserted, Miss Colbert had "many little tantrums, motivated by her antipathy toward me," but "she was wonderful in the part." Later it was said that she told friends, "I've just finished the worst picture in the world."         When Oscar time rolled around, the film won the five top awards: best picture, best writer, best director, best actor and best actress.         When the Oscar was placed in her hands Miss Colbert said, "I owe Frank Capra  for this."         In later years Miss Colbert also appeared frequently on television, and in that medium, too, it was said that despite her talent she could be difficult. Noel Coward, who worked with her in 1956 on the live telecast of his comedy "Blithe Spirit," recorded in his diary that he found her "extremely tiresome."         "All this is a sad pity," he wrote, "because she is, within her limits, an excellent actress and those limits she imposes on herself.I have for years had a definite affection for her as a person, but these rehearsals are wilting it considerably."         Miss Colbert, who was short-necked, liked to tell of a Coward comment during  those rehearsals: "If she had a neck, I'd wring it." Miss Colbert said the comment had hurt at the time, but agreed that it was funny. She and Coward made  up a year later.         Miss Colbert drew praise for her acting, into her 80's. She co-starred on Broadway with Rex Harrison in "The Kingfisher" in 1981 and shared top billing with him again in the 1985 Broadway revival of "Aren't We All?," a 1923 drawing-room comedy by Frederick Lonsdale that took them to Australia for a five-month tour after runs in London, New York, San Francisco and Los Angeles. Mr. Rich of The Times called her the play's "most alluring attraction" and "simply a wonder" as the tea-sipping Lady Frinton.         Always Appreciative Of Her Film Genre         In 1984, a building at the Kaufman Astoria studios in Queens, where she made  her first 10 films for Paramount, was named after her, and the Film Society of Lincoln Center paid tribute to her lifetime achievement with a gala in her honor. She was also honored by the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in 1989.         For years, Miss Colbert spent six months annually at her beachfront estate in Barbados, where her guests included Ingrid Bergman, Frank Sinatra and Ronald and Nancy Reagan. She remained on Barbados after her stroke three years ago.         In 1928, Miss Colbert married Norman Foster, an actor and director who was appearing with her in "The Barker." They were divorced in 1935, and in December  of that year she married Dr. Joel Pressman; he died in 1968, and she leaves no immediate family members.         Miss Colbert never looked down on the material she was best at. The film studios liked her to do comedy, she once said, "because they made a lot of money off me." But she added: "I did the comedy because all my life I always wanted to laugh myself. There was never anything that gave me as much satisfaction as to be in something amusing."         Emancipated, With a Light Touch         During a career that began in the 1920's and lasted into the 1980's, Claudette Colbert starred in more than 60 films and in plays on Broadway and in  London. These are some of the works in which she appeared.

         Margaret Cousins, a writer and editor of books and magazines, died on Tuesday at a nursing home in San Antonio, Tex. She was 91.         Miss Cousins was born in Munday, Tex., and earned a bachelor's degree in English at the University of Texas at Austin in 1926. After working as an editor at The Southern Pharmaceutical Journal, in Dallas, a trade magazine published by her father, she moved in 1937 to New York City. She was an editor at Pictorial Review, for which she wrote short stories and a column called ''Baghdad on the Subway.'' After the review folded, she wrote copy for the promotions department of Hearst magazines before serving as managing editor of Good Housekeeping and McCall's.         In 1961, Miss Cousins became a senior editor at Doubleday, where the books she handled included the best-selling novel ''Hurry Sundown.'' After a brief stint as a special editor at Holt, Rinehart & Winston in 1970, she returned to magazines as the fiction and book editor for The Ladies' Home Journal.         Miss Cousins wrote hundreds of short stories for popular magazines, one of which, ''The Life of Lucy Gallant,'' was made into the 1955 film ''Lucy Gallant,'' starring Jane Wyman. She also wrote several novels and biographies for children, including ''Uncle Edgar and the Reluctant Saint'' (1948), ''Ben Franklin of Old Philadelphia'' (1952), ''We Were There at the Battle of the Alamo'' (1958) and ''Thomas Alva Edison'' (1965). Under the pen name Avery Johns, she wrote the crime novel ''Traffic With Evil'' (1962). She was credited as a co-writer of ''Souvenir: Margaret Truman's Own Story'' (1955).         No immediate family members  survive.       
         Catherine S. East, a little-known Government researcher who became the quiet inspiration for the National Organization for Women and a persistent goad to the nascent feminist movement, died on Saturday at Kendal at Ithaca, a retirement community in Ithaca, N.Y. She was 80.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said Elizabeth R. East, her daughter.         Betty Friedan, whose 1963 book ''The Feminine Mystique'' is credited with helping to spark the modern women's movement, said yesterday that Ms. East was a ''prime mover'' in the 1966 birth of NOW.         ''She and others kept saying how what we needed is an N.A.A.C.P. for women,'' Ms. Friedan said. ''I thought of myself as a writer, not an organizer, but Catherine kept emphasizing that what was needed was outside pressure on the Government.''         Characteristically, Ms. East worked without public acknowledgment and was often so far in the background that friends in the movement started calling her ''Deep Throat.''         As a longtime researcher for the Labor Department and later as executive director for various Federal commissions and task forces on the status of women, she came to know scores of accomplished, professional women, in and out of Government, who were concerned about sex discrimination and became important in the feminist movement.         Moreover, she had an access to and command of facts on employment practices, workplace discrimination and other matters that she often used to disarm critics who opposed feminist legislation. But as a Government employee, she felt she could never take a public, vocal role, friends and colleagues said.         Vera Glaser, a journalist, recalled that at a news conference early in the Nixon Administration, she pointedly asked the new President whether he would appoint more women to his Administration. Ms. Glaser was surprised to get a letter later in which Ms. East wrote, ''I gather from the tone of your question, you might be interested in a few statistics.'' It was the beginning of a fruitful relationship that helped Ms. Glaser write a widely noted five-part newspaper series on discrimination against women. ''A lot of the facts came from Catherine,'' Ms. Glaser said.         In 1963, Ms. East helped write and research a Government report titled ''American Women,'' which called for the establishment of Federal and state commissions on women. It was at a conference of these commissions in June 1966 that a group of women came to Betty Friedan's hotel room to urge the formation of the group that, four months later, became NOW. Although Ms. East was not present in the hotel room, she had urged most of the women there to lobby Ms. Friedan.         ''Catherine would just persist and persist until it happened,'' recalled Mary Eastwood, a retired staff lawyer for the Justice Department and a friend of Ms. East.         The daughter of Ulysses Grant Shipe, a bank president in Huntington, W.Va., and Bertha Woody Shipe, a homemaker, Ms. East was educated at Marshall University in Huntington, where she received a bachelor's degree in history in 1943.         In addition to her daughter Elizabeth, of Ithaca, Ms. East is survived by another daughter, M. Victoria East of Seattle; a brother, Charles D. Shipe of Great Falls, Va., and a granddaughter.       
         Myra Cohn Livingston, a poet, anthologist and teacher who wrote  more than 80 books of poetry for children, died on Friday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 70.         The cause was cancer, said her son Joshua.         As a freshman at Sarah Lawrence College, Mrs. Livingston submitted a collection of poems to Margaret K. McElderry, then the children's book editor of Harcourt Brace. Mrs. McElderry sent a gentle and encouraging note of rejection, urging the young author to keep working. Ten years later Mrs. Livingston resubmitted her manuscript, greatly revised, and it was accepted. ''Whispers and Other Poems'' appeared in 1958.         Mrs. McElderry edited many of Mrs. Livingston's collections, including ''Dilly, Dilly Piccalilli: Poems for the Very Young,'' ''If the Owl Calls Again'' and ''B Is for Baby,'' which was published this year. Mrs. Livingston was also published by several other houses. A particularly successful thematic series including ''Christmas Poems,'' ''Celebrations'' and ''Birthday Poems,'' all illustrated by Leonard Everett Fisher, is published by Holiday House.         A senior instructor in the Writers Extension Program at the University of California at Los Angeles from 1973, Mrs. Livingston was the poet-in-residence for the Beverly Hills Unified School District from 1966 to 1984 and the author of the critical texts ''The Child as Poet: Myth or Reality'' and ''Poem-Making: Ways to Begin Writing Poetry.''         As a critic she was known for her firm belief that anyone who claimed to be a poet must know the classic forms before turning to improvisational or free verse.         Mrs. Livingston was given French horn lessons when she was a child.  She later studied with Darius Milhaud and William Schuman, and played professionally. When Jascha Heifetz, a family friend, was looking for a secretary, she applied. How do you spell Mendelssohn? he asked. She answered correctly and was hired. At the time of her death she was working on a biography of Heifetz.         Mrs. Livingston was married to Richard Roland Livingston, who died in 1990.         In addition to her son Joshua, she is survived by another son, Jonas Cohn Livingston, both of Los Angeles; a daughter, Jennie Livingston of New York City, a film maker; a grandson, Richard Gibbons Livingston, and a sister, Hannah Pakula, a biographer.       
         Phyllis Pearsall, who created the famous ''A to Z'' maps of London by traversing more than 3,000 miles of roads throughout the city, died on Wednesday, her business, Geographers' A-Z Map Company, said today. She was 89 years old and lived in Shoreham, England.         Mrs. Pearsall began producing her maps, which show London's labyrinth of streets from the busiest thoroughfares to the tiniest cul-de-sacs, after getting lost using a map that was 17 years old but proved to be the most up-to-date available. To get her first edition right, she often walked for 18 hours a day, rising at 5 A.M. and eventually covering some 23,000 roads.         In 1936 Mrs. Pearsall printed  10,000 copies of her maps, selling them as indefatigably as she had compiled them. She persuaded a reluctant buyer at W. H. Smith, the British bookseller, to place an order for 250 copies, promising a refund if they went unsold.         The maps were an instant success, and have sold countless millions of copies since, the favorite of visitors and Londoners alike, including the cab drivers and others whose job it is to make their way around the city.         Phyllis Isobel Gross was born in 1906, the daughter of an Irish-Italian mother and a Hungarian mapmaker. She was sent to Roedean, a fashionable girls' boarding school, but was forced to leave at age 14 when her father went bankrupt and fled to the United States. When she returned home, she said once in an interview, the door was answered by the fully  decked-out Maharajah of Patiala, who was in the midst of having his portrait painted by Alfred Orr, Phyllis's mother's lover.         ''Then mother said: 'Alfred has an artistic temperament and couldn't possibly have a little girl in the house. Get a live-in job,' '' Mrs. Pearsall related.         So Phyllis moved to Paris, where she taught English, studied philosophy and Byzantine art, and made money by painting. When she was 21, she married a 38-year-old artist and moved to Spain. After eight years  she left him because, she said, ''he was always angry and frightened.'' The couple had no children.         Returning to London and enlisting the help of her father's draftsman, Mrs. Pearsall founded the Geographer's A-Z Map Company and went to work. It wasn't easy, she said. ''I would go down one street, find three more and have no idea where I was.''         In 1965 Mrs. Pearsall turned the company into a trust to protect it from hostile takeovers. She also set up a trustee company to hold all the shares for staff members, giving up pension and dividend rights for herself, but continuing as chairman and joint managing dirctor.         Mrs. Pearsall suffered a stroke and fractured her spine and skull in a plane crash in the Netherlands in 1946, but she remained active until very late in life. She reported to work well into her 80's, arriving in a red Mercedes that she had been allowed to drive only since the age of 59, when she passed her driving test after more than 200 lessons.         Her London map business grew to include maps of all sizes, maps of other British cities, and road atlases, but Mrs. Pearsall always said that her real love was painting. In 1986 the Royal Geographical Society held an exhibition of her drawings, paintings and etchings.         Mrs. Pearsall wrote several books, including an account of her trips through Spain, a collection of short stories, a company history and a volume describing her business philosophy, in which she advocated generosity (''bonuses to everyone''), courtesy (''no aggressive selling'') and frugality (''Micawber housekeeping''). In 1986 she was made a Member of the British Empire.         Asked once by an interviewer if the doyenne of maps still got lost, she replied, ''Always, dear.''       
         Lynda Gudde, a modern dancer and choreographer, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 54.         The cause has not been determined, said Ronny Cohen, a friend.         Born in San Angelo, Tex., Ms. Gudde was raised in rural Missouri and came to New York City in the late 1960's to continue her dance training. She studied dance at New York University and at the American Dance Festival in New London, Conn.         Ms. Gudde danced with Anna Sokolow and in 1968 formed a company in New York City called Gudde Dancers that was drawn from her dance students at the Julia Richmond High School in Manhattan. Many of her dances were inspired by paintings by artists, including Egon Schiele, Paul Delvaux and Aubrey Beardsley.         In a review of a concert by Ms. Gudde and her dancers in 1971, Anna Kisselgoff wrote in The New York Times that the choreographer had ''a strong theatrical sense'' and was an expressionist at heart. ''This may put her outside the fold,'' Ms. Kisselgoff continued. ''But she is a creator of unusual and colorful imagery.''         Ms. Gudde devoted herself to painting after her company disbanded in 1980. Her work was shown at the Galerie St. Etienne in Manhattan and in group shows during the 1980's.         She is survived by a sister, Janice, of Orange County, Calif.       
         Rose Hamburger, who spent half a century as a real estate agent before eagerly coming out of a reluctant five-year retirement last December to start a new career -- as a racing handicapper for The New York Post -- died on Tuesday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 105.         Her daughter Nancy Sureck said the cause was pneumonia.         As a handicapper, Mrs. Hamburger, whose daily selections appeared with her photograph under a headline identifying her as Gamblin' Rose, brought a certain perspective to her work.         A longtime resident of Baltimore who spent a good deal of time at the nearby Pimlico Race Course, she attended every Preakness Stakes from 1915 to 1988 and may have been the last person alive to have seen all 11 Triple Crown winners, from Sir Barton in 1919 to Affirmed in 1978, win a Triple Crown race.         The daughter of a department store executive, Mrs. Hamburger, whose maiden name was Rosenbaum, was born in Manhattan on Dec. 29, 1890.         A precocious student, she majored in mathematics and music at Normal College, the precursor of Hunter College. When she graduated in 1910 at age 19, Mrs. Hamburger, who was to become Hunter's oldest living graduate, was the youngest graduate in the college's history.         Too young to obtain a teacher's license, she joined her father and uncle on a long trip to Germany, where she had an experience that would change her life.         She not only was taken to her first horse race, she stumbled on an instinctive betting system.         ''I saw this adorable jockey in a little green silk shirt,'' she explained recently, recalling that she bet the equivalent of $5 on the jockey's mount and came away with $25 in winnings.         ''I was hooked,'' she said.         Indeed, after her father was transferred to Baltimore in 1915, she began haunting Pimlico, becoming such a familiar and cherished figure that by the time of the 1920 Preakness she watched Man 'o War win from the owner's box.         After her marriage in 1925 to Mark Hamburger, a member of a prominent clothing store family, she continued her interest in racing, but had to cut down a bit in 1938 when, at age 47, she became the first woman in Baltimore licensed to sell real estate.         Mrs. Hamburger, who had an infectious personality that charmed both buyers and sellers, operated her own business, selling homes with enthusiastic concern for 37 years and becoming a well-known figure in Baltimore.         Not that Mrs. Hamburger ignored the race track. As she later explained, she managed her schedule so that she could make almost daily visits to Pimlico.         With her two daughters grown and living in New York, Mrs. Hamburger, by then a widow, was persuaded to move to Manhattan in 1975, but not to give up her career or her hobby.         At the age of 85 she got a job as a rental agent for a Manhattan building and transferred her racing interest to Belmont and Aqueduct.         Mrs. Hamburger, who loved her work almost as much as horse racing, was finally persuaded to retire five years ago, at the age of 100.         This allowed her to concentrate full time on racing. A letter she wrote to The Daily Racing Form led to a wave of publicity about the 100-year-old horseplayer. She became even more famous when Aqueduct held a race in her honor on her 102d birthday.         Widowed since 1955, Mrs. Hamburger never remarried but contented herself with flirtations, in her later years evincing a special interest in younger men, perhaps because in her later years that was virtually all there were.         At a party at Aqueduct on her 102d birthday in 1992, a guest she introduced as ''my gentleman friend'' admitted that he had not seen Man o' War win the Preakness in 1920. ''I wasn't even born,'' he said.         The fact that she began work for The Post on her 105th birthday and that she later appeared on ''Late Night With David Letterman'' and other television programs and gave many newspaper interviews might suggest she was employed more for her promotional value than for her expertise.         To be sure, her editors graciously refrained from keeping tabs on the record of her daily picks, but Mrs. Hamburger, who took her work so seriously she would be plunged into despair during an inevitable slump, had her share of winners.         Indeed, the woman who began her betting life taking a flyer on an adorable German jockey in 1910 ended her career with a flourish. Her last daily selection before she became ill 10 days ago came home a winner at Saratoga.         In addition to her daughter Nancy, of Manhattan, she is survived by another daughter, Caryl Goldsmith of Manhattan, and three granddaughters.       
         Louisa James Calder, widow of the sculptor Alexander Calder, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.         Mrs. Calder, born in 1905 in Seattle, was a great-niece of Henry, William and Alice James. She met her future husband during a trans-Atlantic voyage. The couple married in 1931 and moved to Paris.         Mrs. Calder executed a series of hooked rugs, based on her husband's designs, and wrote a book on crochet.         She received the United Nations Woman of the Year Award in 1975.         In 1977, two months after her husband's death, she declined to attend White House ceremonies honoring him to press for blanket amnesty for opponents of the Vietnam War.         She is survived by two daughters, Sandra Davidson of France and New York, and Mary Rower of New York and Connecticut; four grandchildren and four great-grandchildren.       
         Louise Talma, a composer whose music combined a Neo-Classical spareness, clarity and lyricism with the structural rigorousness of the 12-tone school, died on Tuesday at Yaddo, the artists' colony near Saratoga Springs, N.Y., where she was composing a song cycle with chamber accompaniment. She was 89 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Talma's opera, ''The Alcestiad,'' a collaboration with Thornton Wilder, became the first work by an American woman to be presented by a major European opera company when it had its premiere at the Frankfurt Opera in 1962. In 1974, she became the first female composer to be elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters.         A prolific composer who was especially adept at text setting, Ms. Talma wrote dozens of song cycles and choral works on both sacred and secular subjects. She also created a catalogue of colorfully scored chamber works and piano pieces, several of which have been recorded, most notably on a 1987 collection of her works on the CRI label, and on an earlier recording made by the Musical Heritage Society. These include ''Four-Handed Fun'' (1939), a light-spirited piano duet, as well as a set of sharp-edged bagatelles (1955) and the hauntingly beautiful ''Ambient Air'' (1983), a set of vivid evocations of nature for flute, violin, cello and piano.         Louise Juliette Talma was born in Arcachon, France, on Oct. 31, 1906, to American parents who were both professional musicians. She grew up in New York City, and studied chemistry at Columbia University while at the same time studying the piano and composition at the Institute of Musical Art, the predecessor of the Juilliard School. She also earned a music degree at New York University and a master of arts degree at Columbia.         As a student, she won prizes both as a pianist and for her compositions, and her ambition at first was to be a pianist. Between 1926 and 1935, she spent her summers studying with Isidore Philipp in France. In 1928, however, she began studying composition with Nadia Boulanger in Fontainebleau, and by 1935, Boulanger persuaded her to devote herself fully to composition. She continued her formal studies with Boulanger until 1939, and later became the first American to teach at Fontainebleau.         Boulanger's influence can be seen in the carefully etched Neo-Classicism of Ms. Talma's earliest works. In the early 1950's, she began using 12-tone techniques, principally as a way of creating themes rather than as an escape from conventional tonality. Yet lyricism and a sense of a tonal center remained crucial elements of her work, as did an approach to instrumental coloration that alluded to the styles of Ravel and Messiaen and often seemed to have more in common with the French style than with contemporary American works.         Ms. Talma taught at the Manhattan School of Music in the late 1920's, and at Hunter College for more than 50 years. She wrote ''Harmony for the College Student'' and was the co-author, with Robert Levin and James S. Harris, of ''Functional Harmony.'' She was a board member of the League of Composers, the International Society for Contemporary Music, the Fontainebleau Arts Association and the American Music Center.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Elizabeth Eyre de Lanux, an American artist, writer and designer of 1920's Art Deco furnishings whose works were rediscovered in the late 1980's, died on Sunday at the DeWitt Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 102.         Mrs. de Lanux designed lacquered furniture and geometric patterned rugs that were produced in Paris in the 1920's. Her modernist furnishings were considered among the most sophisticated and were frequently exhibited with those of Eileen Gray and Jean-Michel Frank.         The designs of Eyre de Lanux, the name she used professionally from the 1920's on, came to light in 1989 when two pieces she had designed were offered in the widely publicized New York auction of the Art Deco collection of Robin Symes, a London antiquities dealer.         One of them, a lacquered table with a Cubist-inspired base from 1929, was reproduced in announcements of the sale, which included Mr. Symes's house, an 1860's carriage house that was modernized by Philip Johnson in 1949 for use as a guest house by the owners, Blanchette and John D. Rockefeller 3d.         By 1989, Mrs. de Lanux's whereabouts were unknown in the design world. But her name was listed in the Manhattan telephone book, and despite her great age and infirmities -- she was legally blind -- she granted several interviews. The table ''was a joke,'' she said. ''I made it as a caricature of a Cubist sculpture.''         Elizabeth Eyre was born in Johnstown, Pa., and studied painting at the Art Students League in Manhattan. In 1918, she married Pierre de Lanux, a French writer and diplomat, who was visiting New York. World War I had just ended, and they immediately moved to Paris. She studied with Brancusi in the early 1920's and became a designer, illustrator and writer. The couple moved in literary and art circles with Andre Gide, Hemingway, Matisse, Picasso and Bernard Berenson. She wrote about that world for Town & Country magazine in the 1920's. And, after she returned to the United States, she wrote in the 1960's for The New Yorker and Harper's Bazaar. Mr. de Lanux died in 1955.         In her later years, Mrs. de Lanux continued as an interior decorator and as an illustrator of children's books, the last of which, ''Overheard in a Bubble Chamber,'' by Lillian Morrison, was published in 1981. Mrs. de Lanux lived alone until she moved in late July to the nursing home. She is survived by her daughter, Anne Strong of Shingle Springs, Calif., and two grandsons, Nicholas Eyre of Napa, Calif., and Paul Eyre of Honolulu.       
         Bibi Besch, an actress who appeared on many of television's most popular shows and was on the board of the Screen Actors Guild, died last Saturday at the Daniel Freeman Hospital in Los Angeles. Ms. Besch, who lived in Los Angeles, was 54.         She died of cancer, said her sister-in-law, Jenny Besch of Manhattan.         Ms. Besch, a daughter of the actress Gusti Huber and the mother of the actress Samantha Mathis, appeared on such television series as ''Northern Exposure,'' ''E.R.,'' ''L.A. Law,'' ''Law and Order,'' ''Night Court,'' Family Ties,'' ''Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman,'' ''Coach,'' ''It's Garry Shandling's Show'' and ''Murder, She Wrote.'' Her performances in ''Doing Time on Maple Drive'' and on ''Northern Exposure'' won her Emmy nominations in 1992 and 1993.         Ms. Besch's film credits included ''Steel Magnolias,'' ''Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan,'' ''Tremors,'' ''Betsy's Wedding,'' ''Who's That Girl'' and ''The Promise.'' A director of the Screen Actors Guild from 1990 until her death, Ms. Besch served on many of the organization's committees, among them the national communications committee, the women's committee, the agents relations committee and the women's health task force.         Ms. Besch was born in Vienna, came to the United States as a child and grew up in the Westchester County towns of Mount Kisco and Chappaqua.         In addition to her daughter, who lives in Los Angeles, Ms. Besch is survived by her brother, Andrew Besch of Manhattan; two sisters, Drea Gillogly of Los Angeles and Christina MacDonald of Monceaux, France, and her stepfather, Joseph Besch of Manhattan.       
         Dorothy Lamour, whose sarong-draped charms adorned many films of the late 1930's and 40's, especially the ''road'' pictures she made with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, died yesterday at her home in North Hollywood, Calif. She was 81 years old.         Miss Lamour, a comely brunette who was also a favorite pinup of thousands of G.I.'s during World War II, was in her heyday at a time when the major studios believed that certain actresses needed something of a signature. Veronica Lake peered out from behind the lock of hair that invariably hid part of her face; Miss Lamour had her trademark sarong.  She wore that clinging garment in a series of films, from the 1936 ''Jungle Princess'' through such 1940's comedies as ''Road to Singapore'' and ''Road to Morocco.''         Miss Lamour appeared in seven of the road pictures, in which she was always the exotic but demure girl invariably won by a crooning Mr. Crosby at the expense of a more comedic Mr. Hope. On occasion, Miss Lamour would join Mr. Crosby in a ballad, such as ''Moonlight Becomes You'' or ''Constantly.'' By the late 1940's, her salary rose to a top of around $450,000 a movie.         But she had no illusions about either her acting or singing ability. Asked by an interviewer if she had ever studied acting or singing, she replied, ''No, can't you tell?''         During World War II, Miss Lamour was also known as ''the bond bombshell'' because of the volunteer work she did selling United States War Bonds. In tours around the country, she was credited with selling some $300 million of the bonds. So  effective was she as a saleswoman that the Government put a private railroad car at her disposal when she decided to go on a bond tour.         She received a belated citation for her bond work from the Treasury in 1965, at which time William H. Neal, at that time the director of the United States Savings Bond Division, credited her with being the first star to offer her services to sell war bonds and the originator of the successful Government plan for payroll deductions for those who wanted part of their salaries set aside for war bond purchases.         Her contributions to the war effort did not stop there. She was frequently seen at the Hollywood Canteen, the nightclub for servicemen founded by Bette Davis and John Garfield, where she spent many hours talking to and dancing with G.I.'s.         Miss Lamour was born on Dec. 10, 1914, in New Orleans as Mary Leta Dorothy Slaton, the daughter of John Watson Slaton and the former Carmen Louise La Porte. Her father was a waiter. Her mother, who soon divorced her father, worked as a waitress.         Young Dorothy never finished high school. The family finances were so desperate that when she was 15, she forged her mother's name to a document that authorized her to drop out of school.         Later, however, she did go to a secretarial school that did not require her to have a high school diploma. She regarded herself as an excellent typist and usually typed her own letters, even after she became quite wealthy.         After she won the 1931 Miss New Orleans beauty contest, she and her mother moved to Chicago, where  Miss Lamour earned $17 a week as an elevator operator for the Marshall Field department store on State Street. She had no training as a singer but was persuaded by a friend to try out for a female vocalist's spot with Herbie Kay, a band leader who  had a national radio show called ''The Yeast Foamers,'' apparently because it was sponsored by Fleischmann's Yeast.         She left Mr. Kay's group and moved to Manhattan, where Rudy Vallee, then a popular singer, helped her get a singing job at a popular night club, El Morocco. She later worked at 1 Fifth Avenue, a cabaret where she met Louis B. Mayer, the Hollywood studio chief. It was Mayer who eventually arranged for her to have a screen test, which led to her Paramount contract in 1935.         When she was at her zenith as a star, her fans suggested that an agent had adopted her last name from the French word for ''love'' as a box-office ploy. In fact, the name was close to one in the family; Miss Lamour adapted it herself from Lambour, which was the last name of her stepfather, Clarence, to whom her mother was briefly married.         Miss Lamour's more than 50 films included ''Typhoon'' (1939), ''Johnny Apollo'' (1940), ''The Fleet's In'' (1941), ''Star-Spangled Rhythm'' (1942), ''Duffy's Tavern'' (1945),  ''Here Comes the Groom'' (1951), ''Donovan's Reef'' (1962) and ''Pajama Party'' (1964).         The seven movies in which she appeared with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope were ''Road to Singapore (1940), ''Road to Zanzibar'' (1941), ''Road to Morocco'' (1942), ''Road to Utopia'' (1946), ''Road to Rio'' (1948) ''Road to Bali'' (1953) and ''Road to Hong Kong'' (1962). Although Miss Lamour worked closely with Mr. Hope and Crosby for many years, she said that she was not close to them personally.         Miss Lamour's first marriage, to Herbie Kay, ended in divorce. She met her second husband, William  Ross Howard 3d, in 1943 while she was on a bond tour. Mr. Howard, who had interests in the frozen food and advertising businesses, died in 1978.         After she retired from the movies, Miss Lamour remained active. In 1968, she starred in the national road show production of ''Hello, Dolly!'' And in 1969, she was named to the Civic Center Commission of Baltimore, where she then lived. She was active in various causes there for many years. In the 1980's, she worked the cabaret circuit, where she sang many of the songs she had sung in her movies.         In the 1987 film ''Creepshow 2,'' she played a sloppily dressed housewife who gets murdered. ''Well, at my age you can't lean against a palm tree and sing 'Moon of Monakoora,''' she said. ''People would look at that and say, 'What is she trying to do?' ''         While ''Creepshow 2'' was her only film role in two decades, she was frequently seen on television, doing guest shots such shows as ''The Love Boat,'' ''Murder, She Wrote'' and, naturally, a few Bob Hope specials.         She is survived by her two sons, John Ridgley Howard and Tom Howard; a stepson, William Ross Howard 4th; a grandson, and a granddaughter.         Correction:  September 24, 1996, Tuesday         An obituary of the actress Dorothy Lamour yesterday reversed parts of the name of her second husband in some copies. He was William Ross Howard 3d, not William Howard Ross 3d.       
         Dr. Lucy Frank Squire, a radiologist who became known as a medical educator, died on Sept. 15 at her home on the West Side of Manhattan. She was 81.         The cause was a heart attack, said her son, Gordon Squire of Williamstown, Mass.         Dr. Squire retired in 1993 as Distinguished Service Professor of Radiology at the State University of New York Health Science Center in Brooklyn. The center announced her death on Friday.         Born in Washington, she received a bachelor's degree from George Washington University and a degree in 1940 from the Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania, now the Medical College of Pennsylvania.         At first, she was unable to decide whether she wanted to be a radiologist or a pathologist, so she chose to take her first year of residency at Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston, since it offered six months of radiology and six months of pathology. But the director of the pathology department did not want a female resident, so Dr. Squire turned to radiology.         After completing her residency in 1945 and having a practice in Syracuse, she joined the faculty of the University of Rochester and received a grant to write a radiology textbook for medical students. Her durable and widely used book, ''Fundamentals of Radiology,'' was published in 1964. Its fourth edition (Harvard, 1988), which she wrote with Dr. Robert A. Novelline, is expected to be supplanted by a fifth in 1997.         In 1966, she began teaching part time at Massachusetts General Hospital and at Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, now the State University of New York Science Center. From 1972 until her retirement, she was a professor of radiology at the center.         In those years, she was the lead author of another durable work, a series of self-instructional texts for medical students, ''Exercises in Diagnostic Radiology'' (Saunders). She was also a co-author of ''Living Anatomy'' (Hanley & Belfus, 1987).         She received awards from the Radiological Society of North America, the Association of University Radiologists and the Regional Conference on Women in Medicine. In 1987, she won the first Marie Curie Award from the American Association of Women Radiologists.         Her marriage in 1937 to Charles F. Squire ended after a decade.       
         Dorothy Lamour, whose sarong-draped charms adorned many films of the late 1930's and 40's, especially the ''road'' pictures she made with Bing Crosby and Bob Hope, died on Sunday at a hospital in Los Angeles.

         Ljuba Welitsch, the flame-haired Bulgarian-born soprano whose career was highlighted by her debut at the Metropolitan Opera in ''Salome'' in 1949, died on Monday in a hospital in Vienna. Miss Welitsch, who had become an Austrian citizen, was 83.         The cause of death was a series of strokes, said Herta Wiedenhuber, the executor of her estate.         Miss Welitsch's performance in the title role of the Richard Strauss opera on Feb. 4, 1949, was regarded as one of the most memorable in Metropolitan Opera history. The packed house had turned out mainly to hear Fritz Reiner make his Met debut as a conductor, but by the time the performance ended, with at least 15 minutes of cheering and whistling from an ecstatic audience, Miss Welitsch had become an international star.         ''Miss Welitsch is a musician and interpreter of flaming temperament, who has the part absolutely in her hand,'' Olin Downes wrote in his review in The New York Times the next day. ''She is an actress of individuality and power.''         A few days later, Miss Welitsch dazzled the critics again, displaying her versatility in the title role of Verdi's ''Aida'' and prompting Howard Taubman of The Times to call her ''one of the few perfect singers to come to the Met in recent years.''         But Miss Welitsch's extensive repertory and her determination to make up for the years on the international stage that she had lost during World War II shortened her operatic career. She drove her voice mercilessly, and by the mid-1950's, critics seemed to agree that her best singing was behind her.         At the Met, she appeared in 63 performances between her debut and her final appearance, in the nonsinging role of the Duchesss of Krakenthorp in Donizetti's ''Fille du Regiment'' on Feb. 17, 1972.         Besides Salome and Aida, her Metropolitan Opera roles included Donna Anna in Mozart's ''Don Giovanni,'' the title role in Puccini's ''Tosca,'' Rosalinde in Johann Strauss's ''Fledermaus'' and Musetta in Puccini's ''Boheme.''         But most of Miss Welitsch's career was spent in Europe, where she was coached by the composer when she made her Vienna Opera debut in a special performance of ''Salome'' that celebrated Richard Strauss's 80th birthday in 1944.         Even when her career in grand opera faded, Miss Welitsch's love of performance kept her busy into the early 1980's in operetta, films, radio, television and on the stage.         She was born in Borissovo, on the Black Sea in Bulgaria, on July 10, 1913. As a child, she liked to sing and play the violin. By her teens she was taking singing lessons, and at 19 entered the Academy of Music in Vienna.         She began her professional career in 1936 with the Graz Opera Company, which played a 10-month season that enabled Miss Welitsch to build her repertory. From 1941 to 1943 she sang in Hamburg and from 1943 to 1946 in Munich. In 1943 she also joined the Vienna Opera, where she made her noteworthy debut in ''Salome'' the next year.         When she made her English debut with the company in 1947, she dazzled audiences at Covent Garden, and by 1948 she had sung Salome more than 50 times and appeared in more than 40 other roles. That summer, while abroad, Edward Johnson, the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, heard Miss Welitsch and engaged her to sing in New York the following year.         In 1956, when she was 43, Miss Welitsch caused a stir in Vienna when she married Karl Schmalvogel, a 29-year-old traffic policeman who had assisted her after an accident a year earlier. They were divorced in 1969.         Miss Welitsch left no immediate survivors.       
         Mary Bass Newlin, an author and former executive editor of Ladies' Home Journal, died at her home in Amagansett, L.I., on Aug. 26. She was 91.         She began her career at the magazine in the mid-1930's as an editorial assistant. She was named executive editor and retained that post until 1963.         Among her writing projects on leaving the magazine was ''Careers at Home,'' a monthly column she wrote for Family Circle magazine from 1967 to 1974. She was also the author of a 1971 book with the same title.         Mrs. Newlin, who was married and widowed four times, was known professionally as Mary Bass for most of her career.         She was born in Chicago and was a graduate of Barnard College.         Her last husband, A. Chauncey Newlin, a lawyer and philanthropist, died in 1983.         She is survived by a son from her second marriage, Richardson Bass of Amagansett.       
         Frances Lear, a mercurial figure in the media world who spent some $25 million she received in a divorce settlement to start a magazine named after herself, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.         She died of breast cancer, said Dr. Jonathan LaPook, her son-in-law.         Ms. Lear was married for 28 years to Norman Lear, the highly successful television producer of series like ''All in the Family'' and ''Maude.'' Her divorce settlement from Mr. Lear, an amount variously estimated to be between $100 million and $112 million, was one of the largest ever recorded.         ''I was very much a part of his thinking,'' she often said, justifying the amount of the settlement. ''Norman could not have done his shows without me.''         It is generally considered -- and she herself claimed -- that she was the inspiration for Maude, the feisty and opinionated title character played by Bea Arthur.         Ms. Lear made a name for herself among feminists, working in political campaigns, including Eugene McCarthy's Presidential campaign in 1968; with the National Organization for Women on behalf of the Equal Rights Amendment, which was not ratified; as a partner in an executive search firm specializing in placing women, and as a writer, producing articles for a number of national publications. But she believed that she had faded into the background as her husband's career took off in the 1970's. After Mr. Lear acquired his own movie studio and founded his own civil liberties group, People for the American Way, she discussed her frustrations in an Op-Ed piece in The New York Times in 1981.         A woman in Hollywood is a nonperson, she wrote, ''unless she is under 21, powerful or a star.'' She noted, too, that an industry wife was looked through, never at. In a later interview, recalling her years as a Hollywood wife, she said she had felt constantly ignored and undervalued, had had little self-esteem and had often been depressed.         Ms. Lear, in her own words, ''always aspired to something out of the ordinary,'' and she moved to New York after her divorce in 1985. She quickly set out to change the nonperson identity she had felt in Hollywood by creating Lear's, a magazine aimed at women like herself -- ''the woman who wasn't born yesterday,'' as the magazine said on its cover.         Lear's began publication in 1988 and was a success. It began with a circulation base of 250,000 and grew to 350,000 in a year. But after two years, Ms. Lear abandoned her original concept and lowered the age of the theoretical Lear's woman to over 35. Abandoning the older-age niche put the magazine into competition with other women's magazines, and its advertising never recovered from the move.         Almost immediately after the magazine's debut, Ms. Lear developed a reputation for being unpredictable and hot-tempered. She held a series of intimate lunches in her apartment during which she sought, and then usually ignored, advice for her fledgling publication. She also frequently brought up more of her personal history than most of her guests were prepared for, revealing that she had a Dickensian childhood, that doctors had determined that she was manic-depressive and had prescribed lithium for her condition, that she was an alcoholic and that she had made several suicide attempts over the years.         There ensued a revolving door of editors and writers, many of whom complained of Ms. Lear's inexperience and capricious decisions. Numerous articles were accepted and not published, and layouts were changed at the last minute. In an article in The New York Times, a staff member recalled that when Ms. Lear had been told that she could not change a quotation, she had shouted, ''It is my magazine, and I will do what I want.''         A former associate once said of her, ''She spent her life in Hollywood, where you go on your gut and you are prized for being slightly nuts.'' Ms. Lear did not deny the validity of the remark. She had lived with that behavior for many years, she said, and ''very possibly some of it rubbed off.''         Although circulation was more than 500,000 in its final months, Lear's ceased publication in March 1994. It had lost an estimated $25 million to $30 million in its six years of operation.         Ms. Lear then formed Lear Television, investing $500,000 in a video production company. The videos, which she referred to as ''television books,'' were specifically for women and dealt with subjects like personal finances and relationships. She had also just completed a book, ''Frances Lear's Guide to Work and Family in the 21st Century,'' which does not yet have a publisher.         Ms. Lear was born on July 14, 1923, at the Vanderheusen Home for Wayward Girls in Hudson, N.Y., the child of an unwed mother and an unknown father. ''The odds were stacked high against me,'' she once said. She was given the name Evelyn, but she was renamed Frances when she was adopted after 14 months in an orphanage by Aline and Herbert Loeb of Larchmont, N.Y.         ''Aline was outwardly affectionate with me for my father's sake, but she did not like me,'' Ms. Lear wrote in ''The Second Seduction,'' (Alfred A. Knopf, 1992) an autobiography that pulled no punches. The slim volume laid out in harrowing detail her personal history and most intimate experiences.         The memoir related her years of sexual abuse, beginning at age 12, by the man whom her adoptive mother married after Mr. Loeb committed suicide during the Depression. She told, too, of being sent to a psychiatrist, to whom she revealed her stepfather's abuse, and of the psychiatrist's betrayal in repeating her confidences to her mother and stepfather. Her stepfather, she wrote, ''met me at the door with a kitchen knife in his hand.'' Her mother ''turned and left the room, went into her bedroom, closed the door and protected her economic hide.'' On her mother's death, her stepfather was left 90 percent of the $100,000 remaining from Mr. Loeb's insurance, Ms. Lear said.         Ms. Lear attended the Mary A. Burnham School for Girls in Northampton, Mass. In the 1940's and early 50's, she held a number of jobs, primarily in advertising and retailing in New York. She was, she never hesitated to say, dismissed from most of them for behavior like listening in on the boss's telephone conversations and drinking through lunch.         For a brief period, she was the camera girl at the Copacabana nightclub in New York. The job ended when she asked Frank Costello, the camera-shy gangster, whether he would like to have his picture taken. Her boss grabbed her under her armpits, lifted her into the air, carried her into the street, set her down, kissed her goodbye and advised her to try another line of work.         Ms. Lear had two short-lived marriages before she met Mr. Lear. Her first marriage, to Arnold Weiss, a traffic manager at the Navy Yard in Charleston, S.C., lasted less than two years. Her second marriage, to Morton Kaufman (''or Kauffman or Kaufmann -- I cannot remember how to spell my second husband's name,'' she wrote in the autobiography), was dissolved within a year. She said that he had been unfaithful, leading to her first suicide attempt and three weeks in the psychiatric ward at Bellevue Hospital.         ''I tried to commit suicide three times seriously and three times with minimal interest in the outcome,'' she once said.         She was 33 and a buyer for better active sportswear at Lord & Taylor when she married Mr. Lear, who was then a television writer, and moved to California. She turned down a buyer's job with a Los Angeles store and concentrated on homemaking and rearing her two daughters.         One day, she recalled, she realized that ''we had become he.'' She began to think seriously of leaving her marriage. It took her 15 years, she said, ''to work up the courage.''         ''I believe the second half of one's life is meant to be better than the first half,'' she said in an interview last year. ''It is certainly true of me.''         Ms. Lear is survived by her two daughters, Maggie Beth Lear and Kate Breckir Lear (who is married to Dr. LaPook), both of Manhattan, and two grandsons.       
         Cynthia Novack, an improvisational dancer and a writer and teacher, died on Sept. 27 at home in Manhattan. She was 49.         The cause was cancer, said Richard Bull, her husband.         Ms. Novack performed with the Richard Bull Dance Theater and the Improvisational Arts Ensemble, companies devoted to freewheeling yet small-scale and intimate performances of improvisational dance, which she founded with Mr. Bull.         She taught at the Tisch School of the Arts at New York University, at Barnard College and at the State University of New York at Brockport before joining the dance faculty at Wesleyan University in 1983. At the time of her death, she was an associate professor of dance and women's studies at the university.         Ms. Novack wrote for publications including The Drama Review, Ethnomusicology, and Women and Performance. She was the author of ''Sharing the Dance: Contact Improvisation and American Culture'' (1990) and was at work on a book about choreography and improvisation.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a stepdaughter, Katie Bull-Prichett of Manhattan, and a granddaughter.       
         Beryl Reid, the versatile British character actress who won a Tony Award in 1967 for her performance in ''The Killing of Sister George'' and was one of the most popular stars on the London stage and on British television, died on Sunday. She was 76.         She had developed pneumonia after undergoing a knee operation, her agent, Robert Luff, said. He would not say where she died.         Ms. Reid, who specialized in eccentric characters, had been a stand-up comic and variety entertainer for 30 years before making the transition to more serious acting. She performed in plays by Joe Orton, Edward Albee and Peter Nichols, as well as in classics for the Royal Shakespeare Company and the National Theater.         She had her greatest success as June Buckridge in Frank Marcus's ''Killing of Sister George.'' June was a lusty, cigar-smoking soap opera actress whose role as a rural nurse named Sister George was being excised from a long-running radio serial. In the play, which was a hit both in London and New York, Ms. Reid and Eileen Atkins portrayed a lesbian couple in a disintegrating relationship.         Friends had warned Ms. Reid not to touch the play ''with a barge pole,'' thinking that the role would damage her image. Instead, it made her international reputation. She later starred in the Robert Aldrich film version, with Susannah York replacing Ms. Atkins. Sister George became her signature role, but it was one of several peaks in her career.         She played the seductive landlady in the film of Joe Orton's ''Entertaining Mr. Sloane'' and recreated that role in a 1975 revival of the play at the Royal Court Theater. Subsequently, she won more admirers in the United States and London through television, especially from her role opposite Alec Guinness in the dramatizations of John le Carre's ''Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy'' and ''Smiley's People.'' Ms. Reid was Connie Sachs, George Smiley's former research aide, who, despite her drinking, retained her exceptional memory.         Ms. Reid was born in Hereford, England. Leaving school at 16, she made her debut in 1936 as a music hall performer at the Floral Hall, Bridlington. Before and during World War II, she took part in variety shows and pantomimes. Her comic imagination was certified on the BBC radio series ''Educating Archie,'' in which she created and played two contrasting roles, a schoolgirl in love with a ventriloquist's dummy and an earthy teen-ager with airs.         In 1951, she made her London stage debut in ''After the Show,'' followed by a series of musical revues, in which she demonstrated the transforming ability of a chameleon. She said she usually played 16 to 18 characters in one night and never looked the same. After Ms. Reid appeared in a revue sketch by Harold Pinter in 1959, Harold Clurman called her ''a real artist and trouper with technical command.''         ''Sister George,'' first presented in Bristol and in London in 1965, was her breakthrough. Later she acted in Mr. Albee's ''Counting the Ways'' at the National, in Congreve's ''Way of the World'' for the Royal Shakespeare Company and in Mr. Nichols's ''Born in the Gardens.''         Her films include ''The Belles of St. Trinian's,'' ''The Dock Brief'' (renamed ''Trial and Error'' in the United States), ''Inspector Clouseau'' and Dylan Thomas's ''Doctor and the Devils.''         In his review in The New York Times, Vincent Canby described her role in ''Joseph Andrews'' in 1977 as ''a battered, flirtatious crone with the manners of a truck driver trying to be dainty.''         Ms. Reid wrote an autobiography, ''So Much Love,'' and was the co-author of ''Cats' Whiskers'' and ''Beryl, Food and Friends.'' In 1986 she was awarded the Order of the British Empire.         Married and divorced twice, she lived in a cottage in Wraysbury, outside London. No immediate family members survive.       
         Millicent Ellis Selsam, an author who filled bookshelf upon bookshelf with primers seeking to still the nagging why's with which children tax their parents' patience and knowledge, died on Saturday at Mary Manning Walsh Home in Manhattan. She was 84 and lived in Manhattan and Fire Island, L.I.         A writer of simple science booklets, she was credited with some 130 titles, scores of which remain in print. While they were tailored for young readers from kindergarten through the early grades, she also wrote science books for teen-agers and a few for adults.         Mrs. Selsam published her first book in 1946, ''From Egg to Chick,'' after having taught high school science in the New York City public school system. Since then her work found outlets at Harper & Row, Morrow, Macmillan, Doubleday and Walker, among other publishers.         She started a series of ''I Can Read Books'' for Harper and regularly contributed to the ''First Look at . . .'' series published by Walker. Both series introduced inquisitive children to the animal kingdom and the marvels small children discover all around them.         Her books received many awards, including the Thomas Alva Edison Award for the best juvenile science book, ''Biography of an Atom'' (1965).         She was born in Brooklyn, graduated from Brooklyn College and earned a master's degree at Columbia University.         She is survived by a son, Robert, of Manhattan, and two grandchildren.       
         Hannah Green, an acclaimed author who wrote one slender novel of such delicately distilled perfection that she could hardly bring herself to compose another, died on Wednesday at New York Hospital in Manhattan, six months after the reissue of her classic work, ''The Dead of the House,'' had been received with almost as much critical enthusiasm as its original publication a generation ago. She was 69 and lived in Greenwich Village.         Her husband, the painter John Wesley, said the cause was lung cancer.         ''The Dead of the House'' was, by format, just another example of a well-worn genre, a coming-of-age novel, in this case a fictionalized account of Ms. Green's childhood in an Ohio village and on the summertime shores of Lake Michigan.         But in her hands the familiar pangs of childhood, the adolescent passage from virginity to passion and the sobering loss of a first love were so exquisitely wrought that critics were instantly smitten.         Indeed, when ''The Dead of the House'' was published by Doubleday in 1972, the author Richard Ellman said reading it was like falling in love.         ''I was, for as long as it took,'' he wrote in The New York Times Book Review, ''able to surrender my own callowness and smugness to the ecstasy that is fiction, is art.''         Other critics had similar praise, which was echoed when Books & Company/Turtle Point Press reissued the book this year. If such enthusiasm seems extreme for what was, after all, a first novel, there was ample evidence that this was a very special first novel. Among other things, the budding first novelist was 46 years old and had been working on the book for the better part of two decades.         She was also a highly schooled professional who had studied with Vladmir Nabokov at Wellesley and with Wallace Stegner while obtaining a master's degree at Stanford. She taught at Stanford for a while before coming to New York and beginning a part-time career as a teacher of creative writing, first at Columbia and later at New York University.         Ms. Green, a native of Glendale, Ohio, was also a precocious child who early on encountered the frustrations of writing that would bedevil her the rest of her life. When she was 4, her husband said, she dreamed up a story about a mischievous pig, but in trying to compose it on her slate could not even get through the title. Her childhood scrawl was so large that she ran out of space after ''The Misch.''         In later years Ms. Green's problem was not her handwriting (she composed on a manual typewriter) but her almost obsessive pursuit of a perfection that always seemed just one rewrite away.         The real wonder of ''The Dead of the House,'' her husband suggested, was not that it took so long, but that it was finished at all. ''She never wanted to let go,'' he said.         A tall, dark-haired woman who dressed conventionally and had an open, unassuming smile, away from the typewriter she seemed anything but an artist. Still, she had her transcendent moments, like the time she and her future husband met. A boyfriend had taken her to a party at Mr. Wesley's studio, the painter recalled,  and while the other guests downed canapes and quaffed beer with gusto, she approached him and asked for an orange.         By some coincidence, he said, he did have an orange, and it was immediate love.         The couple were married in 1971, and a few years later, while traveling in France, Ms. Green had another transcendent moment when at a church in Conques, in south-central France, she encountered the bones of Saint Foy, one of the last martyrs to Roman rule.         ''It blew the top of her head off,'' Mr. Wesley said, noting that for the last 25 years his wife had been writing -- and rewriting -- a book about the martyred 12-year-old girl who was betrayed by her father, refused to renounce her faith and put to death, inspiring a cult that continues in France.         Ms. Green's book, ''Golden Spark, Little Saint: My Book of the Hours of Saint Foy,'' which combines fiction with factual accounts of the Conques region and its people, is to be published by Random House next year.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Mary Lonsdale Hickler of Warwick, Mass.       
         Edith Tilton Penrose, an American-born British economist who was an authority on corporate growth and on oil, died on Oct. 11 in Waterbeach -- near Cambridge, England -- where she lived. She was 81.         Her death was reported on Saturday by The Guardian and The Independent.         Dr. Penrose, whose doctorate was from Johns Hopkins University, retired in 1978 as a professor at the University of London's School of Oriental and African Studies, where she concurrently headed the school's economics department. In later years she was a professor and a dean at the Institut Europeen d'Administration des Affaires in Fontainebleau, France.         Her best-known book is ''The Theory of the Growth of the Firm'' (1959, Oxford), about the ways companies grow and the reasons why they do. Jay B. Barney, a professor of management at Ohio State University, writing in a management journal last year, called it a seminal work about ''the competitive implications of a firm's internal strengths and weaknesses.''         A Scottish economist, Sir Alec Cairncross, recalled in The Independent on Saturday, that the book brought Dr. Penrose ''instant recognition as a creative thinker, and its importance to the analysis of the job of management has been increasingly realized.''         In theorizing about companies, Dr. Penrose held that, as The Guardian  put it: ''There are important administrative restraints on the speed of the firm's growth. Human resources required for the management of change are tied to the individual firm and so are internally scarce. Expansion requires the recruitment of more such resources. New recruits cannot become fully effective overnight. The growth process is, therefore, dynamically constrained.''         Dr. Penrose's interest in oil originated in the late 1950's, when she was a visiting professor at the University of Baghdad. In a 1976 interview, she recalled: ''I was doing a book on multinational corporations, although nobody called them that in those days. Being in Iraq, it would have been rather silly not to concentrate on oil, wouldn't it?''         That book, ''The Large International Firm in Developing Countries: The International Petroleum Industry,'' was published in 1968, and by 1976 she was considered one of the top oil economists in the world.         In the 1976 interview, she said: ''Historically, the international oil companies often have wielded their vast power selfishly, although their accomplishments have often been beneficial to the world.'' By that time, oil executives had often been less than pleased with conclusions expressed in her writings, but she contended: ''I don't take sides. I just gather the facts and if people don't like my work, they just don't like the facts.''         Edith Tilton was born in Los Angeles and received a bachelor's degree in 1936 from the University of California at Berkeley. After working for the American Embassy in London, she received her doctorate in 1950. Her first book, ''Economics of the International Patent System,'' was published in 1951.         Dr. Penrose was a lecturer and research associate at Johns Hopkins for many years. Sir Alec wrote that after a campaign she and her husband, Ernest F. Penrose, a British-born economist and writer, ''conducted in support of Owen Lattimore, a professor accused of un-American activities,'' the couple ''fell afoul of McCarthy and were more or less exiled, first to the Australian National University in Canberra and then to Baghdad University.'' Then the couple moved to Britain.         Dr. Penrose married David Burton Denhardt in 1934; he died in 1938. She married Mr. Penrose in 1944; he died in 1984. Her survivors include three sons.       
         Fritz and Ingeborg Kahlenberg, exiled Germans who met during World War II as members of Hidden Camera, a Dutch Resistance group that documented the Nazi occupation of the Netherlands, died this month at New York University Hospital within two weeks of each other.         The Kahlenbergs, who established Film Authors, a New York film production company after they immigrated to the United States in 1946, lived in Manhattan. Mr. Kahlenberg, 80, died on Oct. 15; Mrs. Kahlenberg, 76, died on Oct. 2.         The couple's daughter, Liz Kahlenberg Bordow, said her mother had died of lung cancer and her father of complications of kidney failure.         Working secretly, the Hidden Camera photographers, led by Mr. Kahlenberg, hoarded rationed film, snapped pictures with cameras concealed in coats or handbags, developed the photographs and, in some cases, tried to smuggle them out of the country.         Under the title ''The Illegal Camera: Photography in the Netherlands During the German Occupation, 1940-1945,'' an exhibition of 75 photographs taken by members of the Hidden Camera opened in August at the Jewish Museum, at Fifth Avenue and 92d Street, where it is to run until Dec. 1.         In addition to the persecution of the Jews, the photographs at the museum cover warfare and occupation, confiscation of goods, compulsory labor, resistance, the ''Hunger Winter'' of 1944-45 when starvation was rampant, and liberation.         One of the most widely known of the Hidden Camera photographs, taken by Cas Oorthuys and included by Edward Steichen in his collection ''The Family of Man,'' studies the face of a sunken-eyed woman gnawing on a crust of bread.         ''The pictures are painful to look at,'' Sarah Boxer wrote in her review in The New York Times.         Henry Kol, the Dutch consul for press and cultural affairs in New York, credited photographs taken by Hidden Camera with providing evidence that enabled the Dutch Government in exile to persuade the Red Cross to arrange food drops.         Mrs. Kahlenberg, who was taught by her husband to operate a camera, was also involved in resistance communications, transporting munitions and the use of forged documents.         Mr. Kahlenberg, who was born in Berlin, where his father was a founder of the U.F.A. film studio, settled in Amsterdam after Hitler came to power and was a film distributor when World War II began.         Mrs. Kahlenberg, whose maiden name was Wallheimer, was born in Bremen and moved to Amsterdam with her family in 1939.         The couple, cited by the Supreme Allied Commander, Gen. Dwight D. Eisenhower, for their resistance activities, were married in 1946 and settled in New York.         For a time, Mr. Kahlenberg was a producer with Telenews, which provided newsreels to movie theaters. In the 1950's, the Kahlenbergs founded Film Authors, a production company.         They produced a wide variety of documentary and travel films for such clients as Pan American Airways, the Icelandic and Scandinavian Travel Bureaus, Holland America Lines and Bermuda. David Frost, Ernie Kovacs and Jonathan Winters were among the narrators.         In addition to their daughter, of Berkeley, Calif., they are survived by  a grandchild.         Mr. Kahlenberg is also survived by a brother, Hans Kahlenberg of Chiddingfold, England. Mrs. Kahlenberg is survived by a brother, Gunthur Wallheimer, and a sister, Helga Ekker, both of Amsterdam.       
         Constance Woodruff, who was active in labor and women's issues and was a Democratic Party stalwart, died on Saturday at St. Michael's Medical Center in Newark. She was 74 and lived in West Orange, N.J.         The cause was cancer, said Jan M. Johnson, executive editor of City News in Plainfield, N.J., for which Mrs. Woodruff wrote political commentary until her illness was diagnosed in the spring.         Mrs. Woodruff was a Democratic National Committeewoman for two terms. She was co-chairwoman of the New Jersey delegation at the 1976 National Democratic Convention.         Six governors, starting with Gov. Richard J. Hughes in the 60's, named her to state commissions. In 1975, Gov. Brendan T. Byrne appointed her the first chairwoman of the State Advisory Commission on the Status of Women despite objections to her strong partisan identification as the secretary of the State Democratic Committee.         She was the chairwoman of the commission for 16 years, traveling the state to foster similar bodies at the county level. She was twice elected to lead the national umbrella Association of Commissions on Women, of which she eventually became president emeritus. The national group advises state organizations, like the New Jersey Division on Women, on issues deemed important to women.         She was born in Newark, and was city editor of the Herald-News of Newark, a black-oriented weekly.         Later, during two decades with the International Ladies Garment Workers, she directed community relations for the union's eastern region.         Along the way, she graduated from Empire State College and got a master's in labor studies from Rutgers University.         She was an adjunct professor of labor studies at Rutgers-Newark and spent her last 10 years in education as director of public relations and development for Essex County College.         Mrs. Woodruff is survived by a sister, Gwendolyn Williams of Petersburg, Va., and a brother, Leon Rochester of East Orange. Her husband of 42 years, Bill Woodruff, died in April.       
         Diana Trilling, an uncompromising cultural and social critic and a member of the circle of writers, thinkers and polemicists of the 1930's, 40's and 50's known as the New York intellectuals, died on Wednesday at Columbia Presbyterian Hospital. She was 91 and lived in Manhattan.         At one point, as a critic for The Nation, Mrs. Trilling read a novel a day for six and a half years, delivering challenging reviews on some of the most important works of the modern era: Evelyn Waugh's ''Brideshead Revisited,'' Robert Penn Warren's ''All the King's Men,'' Jean-Paul Sartre's ''Age of Reason'' and George Orwell's ''1984.''         As a reviewer, she approached her work with ''force, control and precision,'' said Paul Fussell, the scholar and author, in his introduction to a collection of her criticism titled ''Reviewing the Forties'' (Harcourt Brace, 1978). Her theme, he said, was ''the threat of monomanias and systems and theories and sentimentalities to fiction.'' Above all, he said, she was ''impatient with simplicities,'' but ''generous in recognizing real merit.''         As an intellectual living through the Depression, the rise and fall of Fascism and Communism, World War II, the Holocaust, Prohibition and the sexual revolution, Diana Trilling clung to an old-fashioned ethos.         ''My first responsibility was to my home and family,'' she once said. ''I was able to deceive myself that it was a matter of free will and competence that I took on the tasks of the home.'' She credited her husband, Lionel Trilling -- one of the century's foremost literary critics and teachers and the author of works like ''The Liberal Imagination'' that became central documents of American intellectual life -- with her success and development as a critical writer, even as she struggled to establish herself in her own right in later years.         Keeping the Flame, While Breaking Free         To everyone, she was a complicated woman, with a passion for language, a zest for cultural contention and a sharp, usually unforgiving pen. Robert Lowell called her ''a housekeeping goddess of reason.''         She began writing in 1941 and never stopped. Fifty-four years later, in her 90th year, with failing eyesight, she composed a 75-page article on the Welsh literary figure Goronwey Rees, offered it for publication to The New Yorker, then headed for her summer home on Cape Cod. Later, back in her ground-floor apartment on Claremont Avenue near Columbia University, she resumed her routine of writing from 9 in the morning to 1 in the afternoon, five days a week.         She believed that ''writers are what they write, also what they fail to write.'' No novels, no volumes of poetry or short fiction bear her name, but among her credits are five books. These include three collections of essays and reviews and an impressionistic piece of journalism, ''Mrs. Harris: The Death of the Scarsdale Diet Doctor'' (Harcourt Brace, 1981), about the sensational murder trial of Jean Harris, the headmistress of an exclusive girls' school, for the murder of her lover. She also wrote ''The Beginning of the Journey'' (Harcourt Brace, 1993), sometimes a memoir, sometimes an apologia, often a long letter of rebuke to those who thought of her as little more than a sidekick to the scholar with whom she lived for 46 years.         Still, the task of keeping Lionel Trilling's flame while trying to break free of its light sometimes seemed to envelop her. She once told an interviewer that the headline on her obituary would read: ''Diana Trilling Dies at 150. Widow of Distinguished Professor and Literary Critic Lionel Trilling.''         His expertise was acquired; he held a doctorate from Columbia University, taught there in the company of brilliant colleagues and challenged students who went on to produce some of the country's finest literature and criticism. Her expertise, on the other hand, was intuitive; her Radcliffe degree in fine arts, she said, left her ill-prepared for anything except a walk through a gallery or a museum.         ''I graduated from Radcliffe without having read a line of Homer or Dante or Chaucer, without knowing anything of Shakespeare,'' she said. So she learned from her husband, ''casually, unconsciously, by association,'' and along the way discovered that she had a natural acuity for language and an innate sense of what made a good book work.         She suggested in her memoir that Lionel Trilling often used her as an editor and tutor on style. ''What I was trying to bring to his writing was a greater directness and greater fluidity,'' she wrote. Nevertheless, she never doubted ''that, of the two of us, he was the more important writer.'' Her husband ''had more to say than I and a great deal more resonated from what he wrote.''         Her work appeared in some of the best magazines in the country, including The New Yorker, The Atlantic, Harper's and The Saturday Review, but mainly in two journals that were among those at the center of American intellectual life of the period, The Nation, where she wrote book reviews and literary criticism, and The Partisan Review, to which she contributed essays. Her writing bears out her interest in the relationship between esthetics, morality and society and her determination to express moral judgments -- her critics said moralistic judgments -- on literature and the political issues of the day.         She was a fierce anti-Communist, someone who joined some Communist-front groups in the early 1930's but who then became disaffected by the ruthlessness of Stalin, and for the rest of her public life she wore the ideals of Western democracy on her sleeve. Perhaps it was this disaffection that led her to think of herself as a rationalist bent on exposing empty slogans and ideas -- political, literary and cultural. And it was this stance, the immovable anti-Communist who insisted that all ideas be grounded in rationality and morality, that dominated her work.         'An Anxious World' Filled With Fears         A native New Yorker, she was born on July 21, 1905, one of three children of Helene Forbert Rubin and Joseph Rubin, a manufacturer of straw braid. Her parents were immigrant Polish Jews who moved with their children from Westchester to Brooklyn to Manhattan. ''Pleasure was not the principle of our home,'' Mrs. Trilling once wrote. ''I learned early in life that to laugh before breakfast was to cry before dinner.''         She described herself as an ''excessively fearful'' child. First she was afraid of the dark, then of burglars and, as she grew older, eventually of just about everything, especially being alone or leaving the house. ''I regard the whole of my life as having been lived in an anxious world,'' she said.         Her fears, indeed her fear of having so many fears, may have shaped her choice of work, she came to believe, because they made her ''too intent upon reasonableness'' and ''blocked the free play of my imagination.'' Thus she stuck to analytical writing, preferring the logical and cerebral to the fantastic.         In 1927, in a Manhattan speak-easy -- over a drink called a bullfrog (gin, apricot brandy and grenadine) -- she met Lionel Trilling. He was smart and handsome, a graduate student in literature at Columbia. In a short time, they fell in love. Later they slept together. (''Surely going to bed with a man before marriage was the most courageous act of my life,'' she said.) And in 1929, they were married.         ''With marriage I had entered Lionel's world,'' she said. ''It was with his friends that I now chiefly associated. They were not easy companions, these intellectuals. They were overbearing and arrogant, excessively competitive; they lacked magnanimity and often they lacked common courtesy. Ours was a cruelly judgmental society, often malicious and riddled with envy.''         But what a society it was, with Alfred Kazin, Irving Howe, Philip Rahv, William Phillips, Sidney Hook, Delmore Schwartz, Dwight McDonald, Hannah Arendt, Saul Bellow, Mary McCarthy, Clement Greenberg, Irving Kristol and several others striving to set the intellectual agenda of the nation.         In book-cluttered apartments on the Upper West Side, they lived what Mrs. Trilling called ''a life of significant contention.'' In the pages of The Partisan Review, Commentary, The Nation and Dissent, they debated whether America should enter World War II. They quarreled over Trotsky and Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, the Beats and the Columbia riots to such an extent that many of the survivors have not spoken to one another for years.         When these intellectuals were not preoccupied by ideas or pulling apart the culture, they talked incessantly, Mrs. Trilling remembered in her memoir, ''about sex, sex, and more sex, with particular emphasis upon adultery.'' Sex, she continued, ''took up as much conversational space as in later years we would give to politics.''         Wielding Her Pen With Candor         Diana Trilling's career as a critic began in 1941, at the age of 36, when she overheard a telephone conversation between her husband and Margaret Marshall, the literary editor of The Nation, who had called to ask if he could recommend someone to write the magazine's literary notes column. When her husband hung up, Mrs. Trilling looked at him and offered herself for the position.         She held the job for 10 years, often wielding her pen like a Bowie knife: ''A mad, bad, and dangerous book, Allan Seager's 'Equinox' is fiction's most recent attempt to practice psychiatry without a license.'' Or, of Truman Capote's ''Other Voices, Other Rooms'': ''I find myself deeply antipathetic to the whole artistic-moral purpose of Mr. Capote's novel. I would freely trade 80 percent of his technical skill for 20 percent more value in the uses to which it is put.''         She was proud of her reputation as a clear-eyed, uncompromising critic. She liked to tell the story of a Viennese novelist, a refugee from Nazi Austria, who ''was said to have remarked that he had lost his country, his home, his language, but that he had at least one good fortune; he has not been reviewed by me.''         As she approached her 42d birthday, she decided that she and her husband had been squandering their lives. ''We were afraid to be full grown up and to be in command of ourselves and others.'' And so she became pregnant. Their only child, James, was born shortly thereafter, in 1947. James, of Providence, R.I., survives her, as do two grandchildren.         In 1975, Lionel Trilling died of pancreatic cancer at the age of 70, and in the years that followed, she worked hard to assure his legacy, editing a 12-volume uniform edition of his work. But she also strove successfully to establish her own mark, writing essays, publishing two collections of criticism -- ''Reviewing the Forties''  and ''We Must My Darlings'' (Harcourt Brace, 1977) -- and covering the Jean Harris trial. Then, suffering from macular degeneration that left her with eyesight so poor she could no longer type, she dictated her memoir, ''The Beginning of the Journey.''         To the last, she remained contentious, complaining of America's loss of intellectual culture. ''I think the life of significant contention no longer exists,'' she told New York magazine in 1995. ''We have enormous division in our society on sectarian or ideological lines. But we don't have any discourse.'' She said that the best academic minds had drifted into esoteric specialization and she assailed multiculturalism as ''our present-day version of Stalinism -- a culture of moral virtue without thought.''         Earlier this year The New Yorker published her brief memoir of her days at summer camp, and she finished her last book, ''A Visit to Camelot,'' an account of an evening spent at the White House when John F. Kennedy was President.         Three or four times a week in her later years, friends would come to the cluttered apartment to read to her. Among them was the poet Richard Howard, who said that despite her infirmities, she remained ''remarkably autonomous.''         Often the conversation turned to Lionel Trilling. ''Seventeen years have now passed since Lionel's death,'' she wrote at the conclusion of her memoir, ''and hour by hour, minute by minute I still listen for a clock which no longer ticks.''         Correction:  October 31, 1996, Thursday         An obituary of the critic and writer Diana Trilling on Friday omitted part of the title of a collection of her essays. It is ''We Must March My Darlings.''       
         Marion Durham Cuyjet, a pioneering teacher of black dancers, died on Oct. 22 at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital in Philadelphia. Mrs. Cuyjet was 76 and lived in Philadelphia.         She had been suffering from cardiopulmonary disorders, according to her son, Stephen Cuyjet Jr.         Mrs. Cuyjet's most famous pupil was Judith Jamison, artistic director of the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater. Ms. Jamison began training in ballet at the age of 6 with ''Miss Marion,'' as everyone called Mrs. Cuyjet (pronounced soo-zhay).         In addition to teaching classical ballet and other dance techniques,  Mrs. Cuyjet taught her students that ''dancers were not hybrid creatures dropped down from the clouds with no relation to earth,'' as Ms. Jamison noted in her autobiography, ''Dancing Spirit.''         Mrs. Cuyjet also provided subliminal lessons in determination and race relations. ''She looked Caucasian and rented studio space that landlords would not rent to a person they thought was black,'' Ms. Jamison wrote. ''She broke the color barrier and was constantly evicted once black children were discovered on the premises; she had to move her school seven times.''         Born in Cheswold, Del., Mrs. Cuyjet studied ballet in Philadelphia with Essie Marie Dorsey, herself a student of Michel Fokine and Mikhail Mordkin, and opened the Judimar School in 1948. Mrs. Cuyjet created dances for public events in the city, and in the late 1950's was the principal choreographer for the annual Christmas Cotillion sponsored by Heritage House, a leading black cultural organization in Philadelphia.         From 1958 into the 1970's, Mrs. Cuyjet was on the dance faculty at Maryland State College (now the University of Maryland-Eastern Shore) and also taught at Delaware State College in Dover, and Cheney State University in Cheney, Pa. She closed her studio in 1971 and trained as a movement therapist, working at the Philadelphia State Hospital for 11 years. She was also a dance panelist on the Pennsylvania State Arts Council.         Mrs. Cuyjet's husband, Stephen, died in 1980. In addition to her son, Stephen Jr., of San Diego, she is survived by a daughter, Judith Coldvin, of Marlton, N.J.; a son, Mark, of Philadelphia; five grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.       
         Marjorie Shostak, a woman from a traditional family in Flatbush whose book about a bold older woman from the !Kung San tribe in Africa's Kalahari Desert rode an early wave of women's studies and injected new life into techniques of anthropology, died on Sunday at DeKalb Medical Center in Atlanta. She was 51.         The cause was breast cancer, family members said.         Ms. Shostak relayed her findings in a 1981 book, ''Nisa: The Life and Words of a !Kung Woman'' (Harvard University Press), illustrated with her photographs. The book revealed the world of a 50-ish !Kung San woman who says, for example, speaking of sex in old age, ''Then I'll wear the beads and powder and I'll be beautiful again, so beautiful that the men will say, 'Nisa, aren't you a lovely one.' ''         The book, which is frequently used as a text in women's studies and anthropology classes, portrayed Nisa, a name that Ms. Shostak invented to protect the privacy of the subject, as a vibrant, piercing, blunt, frank desert woman who would discuss sex, men, jealousy and women's anatomy as casually as a woman in Flatbush might discuss a grocery list.         The encounter between Nisa and the author took place during Ms. Shostak's initial field work from 1968 to 1971, when she was 21 and had just married her Brooklyn College sweetheart. Nisa was about 30 years older.         Despite the contrast between their social backgrounds, author and subject managed to share emotions and to bridge the gulf of geography and social background, said Ms. Shostak's husband, Dr. Melvin Konner, who is the Samuel Candler Dobbs Professor of Anthropology and an associate professor of psychiatry and neurology at Emory University.         Nisa's life, as described by Ms. Shostak, was one through which readers came to understand that !Kung San were open and direct in ways that amazed Westerners.         ''It was a life that we can recognize emotionally,'' said Brenda Bynum, an associate of Ms. Shostak.         The language of the !Kung San involves a number of click sounds that others find difficult to speak, let alone learn. (The exclamation point, in Western depictions of the language, is used to represent the click sound.) Yet Ms. Shostak was able to learn it by pointing to objects and asking women to talk about them. Learning from women as she sat under trees or in grass huts, Ms. Shostak quickly reached a level of mastery that allowed her to conduct the hours of interviews with Nisa and other women about their lives.         Ms. Shostak wrote the book while she and her husband lived in Cambridge, Mass., where she was an associate of the Peabody Museum of Archeology and Ethnology at Harvard University.         Beginning in 1983, both were associated with Emory University, where she was an adjunct assistant professor of anthropology.         In 1993, Ms. Shostak, part way through an eight-year battle with breast cancer and believing that it would be her last chance to see Nisa, spent weeks searching for her in the deserts and, remarkably, found her. The story was recorded in a second book, ''Nisa Revisited,'' that Ms. Shostak had largely completed before she died, Dr. Konner said.         Ms. Shostak lacked training in anthropology -- she earned a bachelor's degree in literature at Brooklyn College -- but her work was the subject of a number of doctoral studies in that field, and although she wrote few academic works, her field work was often analyzed at academic conferences, her husband said.         She is survived by her husband, two daughters, Susanna B. Konner and Sarah B. Konner, and a son, Adam J. Konner, all of Atlanta; her parents, Jerome and Edna Shostak of Midwood, Brooklyn, and Palm Beach, Fla., and a sister, Lucy Shostak of Baldwin, L.I.       
         Mignon G. Eberhart, a highly prolific author of mystery novels who specialized in stories that combined romance and suspense, died yesterday in the Nathaniel Witherell nursing home in Greenwich, Conn., where she lived. She was 97.         In a 60-year career, Mrs. Eberhardt was one of the most popular mystery writers and one of the most highly paid. She wrote 59 books, including novels and several collections of stories. Her first mystery was published in 1929 and her last, ''Three Days for Emeralds,'' in 1988, when she was in her late 80's.         Her novels have been translated into more than 20 languages, and in the 1930's many of them were turned into movies. Several of her books are still in print, and six of her early novels were recently republished by the University of Nebraska Press.         Reviewing Mrs. Eberhart's ''Next of Kin'' in 1982, Newgate Callendar wrote in The New York Times Book Review that the book ''contains all of the formulas she has so successfully conjured up through the years -- rich families, nice people, romance, something of a locked-room mystery, lots of suspects.''         Mignon Good was born in Lincoln, Neb., on July 6, 1899. She studied for three years at Nebraska Wesleyan University. In 1923, soon after her marriage to Alanson Eberhart, an engineer, she began writing in earnest.         ''The Dark Corridor,'' a novella, was printed in 1925 in Flynn's, a detective magazine. Her first novel,  ''The Patient in Room 18,'' featured Nurse Sarah Keate, an amateur sleuth who worked with a young detective, Lance O'Leary. With or without Detective O'Leary, Nurse Sarah starred in other Eberhart mysteries and was played on the screen by Aline MacMahon, Jane Darwell and Ann Sheridan. Mrs. Eberhart's other detectives included Susan Dare, a mystery writer, and James Wickwire, a banker.         With her penchant for plucky heroines in distress, Mrs. Eberhart was considered a disciple of Mary Roberts Rinehart, but eventually she became known as a writer of romance mysteries with a touch of the gothic. In this area she influenced writers like Mary Higgins Clark.         Her atmospheric stories often took place in exotic locales: Hong Kong, Lisbon, the Caribbean. Among her books are ''While the Patient Slept'' (her second novel, which won the $5,000 Scotland Yard Prize in 1930), ''Never Look Back,'' ''Call After Midnight,'' ''Run Scared,'' ''Speak No Evil'' and ''With This Ring.'' In collaboration with Robert Wallsten, she adapted her novel ''Fair Warning,'' into a play, ''Eight O'Clock Tuesday,'' which ran on Broadway in 1941.         When she was asked to name her favorite writers, she said that she never missed a book by Agatha Christie or Ngaio Marsh. ''They are old friends, of course. But my real love is for the brotherhood and sisterhood of the genre.'' She added, ''I love mystery writers as a breed, and am so glad to belong.''         No immediate family members survive.       
         Dr. Roma Gans, an emeritus professor of education at Teachers College of Columbia University who wrote several classic texts on teaching children to read, died on Oct. 4 at the Springside Nursing Home in Pittsfield, Mass. She was 102.         In books and lectures, Dr. Gans urged teachers to inspire children by  reading to them, and introducing them to reading materials on hobbies and subjects of interest to them. She disagreed with teachers and parents who dismissed the benefits of play, taking the position that it was significant to early development.         Among her books on teaching reading are several texts still in use, including ''Guiding Children's Reaching Through Experience,'' published by Teachers College in 1942, and ''Common Sense in Teaching Reading'' (Bobbs-Merrill, 1963).         Dr. Gans, who was born in St. Cloud, Minn., graduated from Columbia University and in 1929 joined the faculty at Teachers College, from which she received a Ph.D. in 1940. The school estimates that 1,000 students passed through her classes at the college each year.         After retiring from the classroom in 1959, she became a prolific author of children's books in a science series for Crowell Company, ''Let's Read and Find Out,'' many of which remain in print.         Dr. Gans aimed her books at the youngest readers, explaining matters that might fascinate kindergartners. The titles ranged from icebergs and dinosaurs to hummingbirds, crystals and rock collecting, including ''When Birds Change Their Feathers'' (1980) and ''How Do Birds Find Their Way,'' reprinted this year.         She was a past chairman of the Citizens Committee for Children of New York City, an organization of professional and lay experts active in child welfare work.         Dr. Gans is survived by three sisters, Mary Ann Farraro and Elizabeth Nentl of St. Cloud, Minn., and Blanche Frick of Pittsfield, Mass.       
         Virginia Cherrill, a 1930's actress who starred as a beautiful, blind flower girl in the classic Charlie Chaplin silent film ''City Lights'' (1931), died late Thursday in a hospital in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 88 and had settled in Santa Barbara in 1950.         Miss Cherrill was born near Carthage, Ill. and educated at schools in Kenosha, Wis., and Chicago.         After an early marriage to Irving Adler, a Chicago lawyer, ended in divorce, she went to California to recover and met Chaplin there. He has variously been said to have first noticed her on a California beach and when they were both at a boxing match.         David Robinson, film critic for The Times of London, wrote in a 1985 biography of Chaplin that the actor gave Miss Cherrill the part of the flower girl largely because she portrayed a blind person appealingly, in a test, after he advised her to look at him but ''to look inwardly and not to see me.''         In the movie, Chaplin starred opposite her as a little tramp who fell in love with her. Its final scene, with close-ups of Miss Cherrill, has won special praise. The writer and critic James Agee called it ''enough to shrivel the heart to see, the greatest piece of acting and the highest moment in movies.''         Miss Cherrill starred in several other American-made movies in the early 1930's and met Cary Grant at a film premiere. They were married in 1933, and she went on to retire briefly from movie making.         Their divorce came in 1935. Then she resumed her career, again briefly, in Britain, where she acted in two films. Later she said, ''I was no great shakes as an actress.''         She retired from movie making for good when she began her nine-year marriage to the ninth Earl of Jersey, in 1937.         As the Countess of Jersey, she did charity work in Britain during World War II.         She is survived by her husband of 48 years, Florian Martini, a World War II flying ace.       
         Dr. Evelyn Hooker, a psychologist who defied conventional wisdom and greatly emboldened the fledgling gay rights movement in the 1950's by finding there was no measurable psychological difference between homosexual and heterosexual men, died on Monday at her home in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 89.         Dr. Hooker, who spent 30 years teaching at the University of California at Los Angeles, began studying homosexual men in the late 1940's, a period in which they were considered maladjusted -- at best -- and generally ignored or anathematized by the medical and mental health professions.         ''She never treated us like some strange tribe,'' recalled the writer Christopher Isherwood, who knew her at the time, ''so we told her things we never told anyone before.''         Her most significant work was a paper delivered in 1956 to the American Psychological Association in Chicago and published the next year as ''The Adjustment of the Male Overt Homosexual'' in The Journal of Projective Techniques.         Dr. Hooker administered three standard personality tests, including the Rorschach ink-blot test, to two groups of 30 men, one heterosexual, one homosexual, who had been matched in I.Q.'s, age and education levels.         She then asked a panel of expert clinicians to assess the results without knowing the subjects' sexual orientation. To their surprise, the judges were unable to discern between the two groups on the basis of the test.         ''The most striking finding of the three judges,'' Dr. Hooker wrote, ''was that many of the homosexuals were very well adjusted. In fact, the three judges agreed on two-thirds of the group as being average to superior in adjustment. Not only do all homosexuals not have strong feminine identification, nor are they all 'somewhat paranoid,' but, according to the judges, some may not be characterized by any demonstrable pathology.''         Her study was criticized in many quarters, not least because it upended psychological orthodoxy. Among other objections was that she recruited her gay subjects through the assistance of ''homophile'' groups like the Mattachine Society, meaning that the men might be more content with their lives than the average homosexual and eager to prove that they were well adjusted.         Moreover, the study was published in a journal that did not reach a wide public audience. Nonetheless, it was considered a precursor to the decision 17 years later by the American Psychiatric Association to remove homosexuality from its list of disorders in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.         ''Her work in the 1950's really provided the framework within which the American Psychiatric Association could rethink its viewpoint,'' said Dr. Richard A. Isay, clinical professor of psychiatry at the Cornell University Medical College.         And 36 years after Dr. Hooker addressed the American Psychological Association, the organization gave her its award for distinguished contribution to psychology in the public interest, saying, ''This revolutionary study provided empirical evidence that normal homosexuals existed and supported the radical idea then emerging that homosexuality is within the normal range of human behavior.''         Evelyn Gentry was born in North Platte, Neb., in 1907 and grew up in northeastern Colorado. She earned her bachelor's and master's degrees at the University of Colorado and her Ph.D., in 1932, from Johns Hopkins University.         Her exposure to the rise of Nazism while in Berlin on a fellowship in the late 1930's intensified her desire to make ''her life count in helping to correct social injustice,'' said a 1992 article in American Psychologist.         She joined the faculty at U.C.L.A. in 1939 and, outside of one year at Bryn Mawr, remained there until 1970. It was at U.C.L.A. in the 1940's that she befriended a gay student, Sam From, who introduced her in turn to his circle of friends. It was Mr. From who said, ''We have let you see us as we are, and now, it is your scientific duty to make a study of people like us.''         At the peak of the McCarthy period, in 1953, she applied for and received a grant from the National Institute of Mental Health. ''They talk about all this courage I'm supposed to have had,'' she recalled four decades later, in an interview with The Los Angeles Times. ''I don't get that. Curiosity and empathy were what compelled me to do my study.''         In 1967, Dr. Hooker was appointed to head a study group on homosexuality for the National Institute of Mental Health. That panel recommended a repeal of sodomy laws and better public education about homosexuality.         After retiring from U.C.L.A., Dr. Hooker had a private practice until the late 1970's. She reviewed articles for professional journals and helped establish the Placek Fund of the American Psychological Foundation, which provides money for research into homosexuality.         She was also the subject of a 1992 documentary, ''Changing Our Minds: The Story of Dr. Evelyn Hooker,'' by David Haugland and Richard Schmiechen.         Her second husband, Edward Niles Hooker, died in 1957. She is survived by two sisters, Mildred Haugh, of Downey, Calif., and Myrtle Fisher, of Colorado.         In recent years, Dr. Hooker was frequently approached by strangers wanting to express their gratitude, such as a young woman who told her that she had been committed to a psychiatric hospital when her parents learned she was a lesbian.         ''The standard procedure for treating homosexuals in that hospital was electroshock therapy,'' Dr. Hooker recalled in the book ''Making History'' (HarperCollins, 1992) by Eric Marcus.         ''Her psychiatrist was familiar with my work and he was able to keep them from giving it to her. She had tears streaming down her face as she told me this. I know that wherever I go, there are men and women for whom my little bit of work and my caring enough to do it has made an enormous difference in their lives.''       
         Joan Paterson Kerr, a picture editor and author, died yesterday at her home in New Haven. She was 75.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Kerr was a founding picture editor of American Heritage magazine. She was a co-editor of ''American Album,'' published by American Heritage, and ''The Romantic Egoists,'' a pictorial history of F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald. She also was a picture editor at Newsweek Books and for the Book-of-the-Month Club series ''The American Past.''         Mrs. Kerr also compiled ''A Bully Father: Theodore Roosevelt's Letters to His Children'' (1995), for which she wrote the biographical essay and notes.         She is survived by her husband, Chester, former director of the Yale University Press; two daughters, Hilary Mills Loomis of Manhattan and Alley Mills Bean of Los Angeles; a son, Tony Mills of Oakland, Calif., and two grandchildren.       
         Eleanor Lansing Dulles, an economic specialist for the State Department who played a major part in planning the reconstruction of West Berlin in the 1950's, died on Wednesday in the Knollwood military retirement home in Washington. She was 101.         Her death was reported by The Associated Press on Friday.         Mrs. Dulles, who was sometimes called ''the Mother of Berlin'' for her enthusiastic efforts to revitalize the economy and culture of that battered capital as it recovered from World War II, managed to carve for herself a formidable reputation even though her two brothers, John Foster Dulles and Allen Welsh Dulles, held much higher rank in the American Government.         She was offered the State Department's Berlin desk in 1952, just before Foster Dulles was named Secretary of State.         She quickly saw trouble coming, she said in a memoir published in 1980, because Foster had been criticized for using his influence to get Allen the top job in the C.I.A. and wanted to avoid further accusations of nepotism. She was already a career diplomat, and her West Berlin position came through before Mr. Dulles's appointment, yet once he was in office, he tried to force her out. He did not succeed, she noted with some satisfaction.         Mrs. Dulles said it was difficult for a woman to serve in the State Department in that era.         ''This place is a real man's world if ever there was one,'' she said in 1958. ''It's riddled with prejudices. If you are a woman in Government service you just have to work 10 times as hard -- and even then it takes much skill to paddle around the various taboos. But it is fun to see how far you can get in spite of being a woman.''         Mrs. Dulles was born in Watertown, N.Y., one of five children of a Presbyterian minister and his wife. One ancestor, John Welsh, served as envoy to Britain in Rutherford B. Hayes's Administration, and her grandfather John W. Foster and an uncle, Robert Lansing, each served as Secretary of State, under Presidents Benjamin Harrison and Woodrow Wilson, respectively.         She graduated from Bryn Mawr College with a major in social sciences, worked in refugee rehabilitation and reconstruction projects in France after World War I and returned to Bryn Mawr to earn a master's degree in labor and industrial economics.         She took odd jobs in the early 1920's -- running a punch press at the American Tube & Stamping Company in Bridgeport, Conn., and working as payroll clerk for a hair net company in Long Island City, Queens.         She also traveled extensively in Europe, studied at the London School of Economics, investigated industrial methods in 75 British firms and received a master's degree from Radcliffe College and a doctorate in economics from Harvard.         In the 1930's she studied and taught economics and finance in Paris, Geneva, Basel, Boston, the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, and Bryn Mawr. She produced scholarly books including ''The French Franc, 1914-1928,'' ''The Facts and Their Interpretation'' and ''The Bank for International Settlements at Work.'' She wrote more than a dozen books in all.         When she was 30 she met David Simon Blondheim, a philologist who, as an Orthodox Jew, was not regarded by her family as marriage material, she indicated in her memoir. She married him anyway, in 1932. In 1934, not long before the birth of their son, Dr. Blondheim committed suicide.         Mrs. Dulles, who used her maiden surname, entered Government service in 1936 as director of financial research for the Social Security Board. In 1942 she moved on to the State Department. At the Bretton Woods international monetary conference in New Hampshire in 1944, she was a prominent member of the American delegation.         The next year, she went to Vienna as the State Department's financial attache. She demonstrated keen bargaining powers -- helping to feed starving Austrians by arranging the barter of horses for German cabbages and potatoes.         Later, as special assistant to the director of the State Department's office of German affairs, Mrs. Dulles was credited with ''working miracles,'' as one biographer put it. She helped to reduce West German unemployment and increase production.         To hasten those developments, she said, she would ''send requests from Berlin for money and rush back to Washington in time to compose favorable answers.'' She wangled more than $1 billion for West Berlin, adorning it with the now-famous Congress Hall, which Berliners for many years fondly referred to as the ''Dulleseum'' and ''Frau Dulles's Hut,'' as well as a hospital and educational centers.         Beginning in 1959, Mrs. Dulles was assigned to studying foreign aid programs and visited 60 countries on behalf of the State Department's office of intelligence and research.         She left the State Department in 1962, after her brother Allen had been dismissed from the C.I.A. in the wake of the Bay of Pigs catastrophe. Leonard Mosley wrote in his 1978 book ''Dulles'' that early in 1962, during the Kennedy Administration, Secretary of State Dean Rusk summoned her and said, ''The White House has asked me to get rid of you.''         Mrs. Dulles, in her memoirs, ''Eleanor Lansing Dulles: Chances of a Lifetime,'' published in 1980, wrote affectionately of her older brothers but did not hesitate to say that since childhood there were frictions among the siblings. She also admitted that her strong personality won her her share of enemies.         She suffered from poor eyesight since childhood and developed deafness but remained active well into her old age.         Her survivors include her son, David, of Washington, and her daughter, Ann Dulles Joor, of Manlius, N.Y., and six grandchildren.       
         Miriam Levin Goldberg, who studied underachievement by gifted youths and taught at Teachers College of Columbia University, died on  Nov. 21 at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center. She was 80 and lived in the Bronx.         The cause was emphysema, family members said.         As a faculty member at Teachers College for 26 years, Dr. Goldberg ''was very rigorous and galvanized our sense of social consciousness,'' said Dr. Susan Sacks, a former student of Dr. Goldberg's who is on the faculty at Barnard College.         Dr. Goldberg, a professor of psychology and education, was co-author, with A. Harry Passow and Abraham J. Tannenbaum, of ''Planning for Talented Youth'' (1955, Teachers College). She also wrote ''Research on the Talented'' (1965) and ''The Effect of Ability Grouping'' (1966), both published by the college.         Miriam Levin was born in 1916 in Baku in what is now Azerbaijan, and immigrated at age 5. She received her bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees from Teachers College.         Her husband, Carl Goldberg, died in 1972. She is survived by her son, Dr. Daniel Goldberg of Athens, Pa.; two sisters, Hannah Levin of the Bronx and Shulamis Friedman of Brooklyn; and two granddaughters.       
         Somaya Fahmy, a pioneer of clinical psychology in Egypt and a women's rights advocate who developed literacy programs for rural Arab villages, died in Cairo on Nov. 29. She was 86.         Dr. Fahmy, a professor of clinical psychology at the University of Ain Shams in Cairo for many years, was a founder of the Egyptian Psychological Association and its president from 1972 to 1981.         She studied at the University of London and received a doctorate in psychology from Indiana University in 1953. She also practiced psychology in Geneva.         Dr. Fahmy, born in Mansura, Egypt, in 1910 to a family prominent in medicine, was trained as a teacher before turning to psychology. In an early experiment, she began a literacy campaign in the Nile delta and wrote about the improvements in the lives of village women.         Her marriage to Hussein Fawzi ended in divorce. She is survived by two sons, Dr. Hussein Fawzi, a physician in Scotland, and Ahmad Fawzi, deputy spokesman for the Secretary General of the United Nations in New York.       
         At 94, Brooke Astor is giving up giving away money.         After more than 30 years of overseeing a foundation that has donated $175 million in New York City, to world-renowned cultural institutions and tiny neighborhood service programs, Mrs. Astor says she wants more time to travel and write poetry. She has decided to close the Vincent Astor Foundation, and will give away its remaining $25 million by the end of next year.         While there are many larger philanthropic foundations, few have become so entwined in the fabric of the city's life, because of Mrs. Astor's role as a social arbiter and her determination to focus her efforts on New York.         She also set a standard for personal involvement in philanthropy. Determined to know every group that received money, Mrs. Astor personally visited hundreds of organizations, from the New York Public Library to a modest program that gives furniture to formerly homeless families.         That effort began when Mrs. Astor visited two families who had been homeless and had then moved into apartments in Queens with almost no furniture.         ''How can you build a new life if you don't have any furniture?'' Mrs. Astor said. ''To move into a place and just sit there with a bag and not even have a teacup is terrible.''         She mobilized a group of nonprofit agencies and foundations to support a fledgling organization called Furnish a Future, which provides furniture at low cost for such families.         Even her giving to the city's leading institutions, including $20 million to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and an equivalent sum sum to the New York Public Library, has been characterized by a concern for individuals, those who know her say.         Most recently, the foundation gave $250,000 for a room for the staff of the new Science, Business and Industry Library on 34th Street, and just last week she gave her annual Christmas lunch for more than 1,000 employees at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         Vartan Gregorian, president of Brown University, who was president of the New York Public Library from 1980 to 1988, said Mrs. Astor ''has given equal attention to janitors and guards as to librarians and curators and the rich and famous.''         Shelby White, a trustee and a donor at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, said: ''She set the pattern for making philanthropy socially desirable. She was the model that everyone aspired to. But she did not do it to climb social ladders. After all, she was already on top.''         In an interview at the offices of the Vincent Astor Foundation on Park Avenue, Mrs. Astor, dressed in a black Valentino suit, wide-brimmed black hat and strands of pearls, said that during 1997 she would decide how to give away the rest of the money. The recipients will primarily be education oriented, Mrs. Astor said, with existing recipients getting most of the money.         ''But we're not telling anybody what we're doing,'' Mrs. Astor said, smiling mischievously. ''We don't know ourselves yet.''         As to why she chose this moment to close down the foundation, she said simply, ''Age.''         She said she had had a wonderful time running the foundation, but added: ''I don't think I can do as much as I used to, and couldn't do it as well. I would like to have one year, before I dance into my grave, of doing something good for myself.''         Mrs. Astor, who was brought up in China, said that she wanted to make one more trip there. Now that she has taken to writing poetry -- she has had two poems published in The New Yorker -- she said she hopes to spend more time writing.         Mrs. Astor said she had considered keeping the foundation going with someone else at the helm, but decided against it.         ''My son is not an Astor,'' she said, referring to her son, Tony Russell, from an earlier marriage. ''There is no family to leave it to. If you have children, like the Rockefellers did, you leave it to your children. If you have no children, I think it is a nice idea to close it.''         For his part, Mr. Russell said he supported his mother's decision, noting how difficult it would have been to take over an effort so strongly identified with her. ''I would hate to second-guess, 'Is this something that my mother would like to give to?' '' he said.         Mrs. Astor's efforts began in earnest in 1959, when her third husband, Vincent Astor, died, leaving the foundation assets of $67 million.         The decision to focus the foundation's philanthropy on New York was hers. The foundation's only mandate was ''the alleviation of human misery,'' but Mrs. Astor decided that since the Astor family money derived in part from New York City real estate, she wanted to return it to the city.         ''The mandate has been pretty straightforward,'' said Linda Gillies, the foundation's director. ''Housing, literacy, the arts and some planning and landmarks.''         From the beginning, Mrs. Astor was deeply and personally involved.  Marjory Rice, the director of Furnish a Future, said Mrs. Astor has appeared at functions for the organization and helped raise money. ''It creates a wonderful stir of excitement,'' she said. ''It is is sort of like having a wonderful magic wand.''         Another favorite cause has been the Manhattan Comprehensive Night and Day High School, which lets young people who have dropped out of high school and started working  get a high school diploma. Its founder and principal, Howard Friedman, wrote to the Astor foundation in 1989 seeking money for a library. Mrs. Astor spent a day visiting the school, and since then the school has received $50,000.         ''She spent hours there,'' Mr. Friedman said. ''I got worried because it was so hot and she was going up and down the stars from room to room. She started speaking Chinese with the Chinese students. She really bonded with students. From that we developed a relationship.''         Mrs. Astor said she was struck by the students' efforts to help themselves. ''They were the sort of children who wanted to do something but did not have the proper education, and they realized that,'' she said.         The Astor foundation has been known for spreading its wealth over a wide range of causes. Of the $1.58 million the foundation gave away in 1995, 105 of the total of 111 grants were between $1,000 and $50,000.         Mrs. Astor is best known for her affiliation with the New York Public Library. During the 1980's, she resigned from the boards of Rockefeller University and the Bronx Zoo to work more intensely for the library.         Mr. Gregorian said that one approach he and Mrs. Astor settled on to raise money was to convince people that being associated with the library was good for them.         ''People don't add class to the library,'' he said. ''It was the library that added class to them. To serve the library is to service civilization, culture and democracy. It is the only institution that can be populist and elitist.''         Mrs. Astor has been able to meld the worlds of society and accomplishment in an unusually public way. Mr. Gregorian recalled that when Mrs. Astor gave a dinner for the library, she invited virtually the same people she had recently invited to a party for President Reagan.         The library's chairwoman, Elizabeth Rohatyn, said it was hard to imagine the future without Mrs. Astor's involvement. But, she said, ''With the reflection of her vast interest, the library has evolved into a very strong institution.''         The Astor foundation will close down in a year, but Mrs. Astor is unlikely to forsake her role at the center of New York life. ''I adore people,'' she said.         Correction:  December 21, 1996, Saturday         An article on Wednesday about Brooke Astor's plans to close the Vincent Astor Foundation misidentified her son, who expressed support for his mother's decision against leaving it in his hands or someone else's. He is Anthony D. Marshall, not Tony Russell.       
         Joan Hartman-Goldsmith, an art historian and writer known for her expertise in Chinese works, especially jade, died on Tuesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 63.         The cause was colon cancer, her family said.         At her death Mrs. Goldsmith was the director of the Institute for Asian Studies on East 44th Street, which she founded in 1981 as a school for adult education. Its lecture programs cover a wide range of historical and contemporary subjects pertaining to Asia.         She also was a member of the art committee of the China Institute in America, which has its headquarters on East 65th Street. She established the institute's art gallery and helped in its work for nearly three decades.         She contributed numerous articles and book reviews to art publications and also wrote about jade and Chinese art for the general reader. Her most recent book was ''Chinese Jade,'' published in 1986 by Oxford University Press in Hong Kong.         Born Joan Lederman in Malden, Mass., she graduated from George Washington High School in Manhattan. She studied Chinese art on her own for 10 years and started a career at the China Institute and the School for Continuing Education at New York University. In the 1970's she worked as an administrator at the Jewish Museum in Manhattan.         Mrs. Goldsmith made 13 trips to China, most recently in June. She lectured at the Cooper-Hewitt Institute of Design as well as other museums and institutes across the country and abroad.         A marriage to Alan Hartman ended in divorce.         Mrs. Goldsmith is survived by her husband, Robert L. Goldsmith; a daughter, Hedy Hartman of St. George, S.I.; and a sister, Louisa Lubar of Newton Centre, Mass.       
         Carol Robbins, a trained musician, educator and co-director of the Nordoff-Robbins Center for Music Therapy at New York University, died on Dec. 12 at her home in Greenwich Village. She was 54.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, Dr. Clive Robbins.         She started her musical education at 8 and, by the time she finished high school, was an accomplished vocalist, church organist and accompanist. She earned B.S. and M.S. degrees in music education at the Crane School of Music at State University College in Potsdam, N.Y., and was certified as a teacher for youngsters with perceptual handicaps. She started training in music therapy in 1966 with Paul Nordoff and Dr. Robbins, founders of a creative music therapy practiced at schools in this country and Europe. Her own career began at the Little Red School House in Poughkeepsie.         After she and Dr. Robbins were married in 1975, the couple worked as a team. They developed a music curriculum for the New York State School for the Deaf in Rome, N.Y., working with severely hearing-impaired youngsters.         With Prof. Arthur Boothroyd they researched musical perception by such children as a basis for establishing techniques aimed at getting even the most profoundly deaf among them to play music.         Mrs. Robbins's vocal and keyboard skills at improvisation added versatility to their work and freedom to explore. Together, the Robbinses wrote ''Music for the Hearing Impaired and Other Special Groups: A Resource Manual and Curriculum Guide'' (MMB Music, 1980), a standard text in this specialized field.         She taught Nordoff-Robbins music therapy at institutes and schools in London, Germany and Japan and traveled worldwide to lecture and teach. She and Dr. Robbins returned to this country in 1989 to establish and direct the center at N.Y.U. within the Graduate Music Therapy Program, where it provides treatment, training and research.         In addition to her husband, Mrs. Robbins is survived by a daughter, Debra Matteson of Ilion, N.Y.; her mother, Adalyn Matteson, and her siblings, Christine Phinney and David Matteson, all of Oswego.       
         Elizabeth Ege Freudenheim, a freelance writer and author who specialized in writing about crafts, textiles and the arts, died yesterday at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. She was 70.         The cause was ovarian cancer, said her husband, Milt, who is a reporter for The New York Times.         After starting her career in Ohio as a curator at the Akron Art Institute, she began to contribute articles to The Chicago Daily News and The International Herald Tribune in Paris. Later, using Betty Freudenheim as her byline, she regularly contributed columns on crafts to The New York Times and wrote for magazines like American Crafts and Fiber Arts. With Jack Lenor Larsen, she was co-author of ''Interlacing: The Elemental Fabric.''         Besides her husband of 44 years, Mrs. Freudenehim is survived by two daughters, Jo Frisch of Buffalo and Susan Core of Los Angeles; two sons, John M. and Tom, both of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.       
         Magda Denes, a psychoanalyst who had just completed a book recounting her torment as a Jewish child hunted by the Nazis in wartime Budapest, was found dead on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 62.         She apparently had suffered a heart attack or stroke, her family said yesterday through a friend, Geoffrey Weill.         Dr. Denes's second book, ''Castles Burning: A Child's Life in War,'' is to be published in January by W. W. Norton. A book party was set for Jan. 9, after which Dr. Denes was to give readings and interviews around the United States and abroad. Rights to the book, which was selected as a Literary Guild featured alternate, were also recently sold for German, British and Dutch publication.         The book recounts Dr. Denes's ordeal as one of the so-called hidden children, estimated to number from 10,000 to 100,000, who spent World War II in stables and caves and secret rooms like Anne Frank's annex in Amsterdam. Young Madga was 5 in 1939 when her father, Gyula Denes, a wealthy publisher, fled Budapest, abandoning his daughter, son and wife, who sought refuge in houses protected by Swiss diplomats.         For five months in 1944, she and her family lived in a basement, and on occasion, she wrote, she hid in a filthy bathroom and an oven.         In despair, she and her family once debated whether to commit suicide or continue to hide. Magda, then 9, cast the deciding vote for survival.         In December 1944, months before liberation by Soviet forces, her 16-year-old brother, Ivan, who had been a secret courier for the Zionist resistance group Hashomer, was caught and shot. After the war, she and her mother, grandmother and aunt fled  to France and then to Cuba before immigrating to the United States.         She was 12 before she re-encountered her father, who pronounced her a rather unpleasant child. ''I know,'' she said she replied. ''Starving for prolonged periods of time while simultaneously being fed on by packs of lice tends to corrode one's pleasanter side.''         In New York City, Ms. Denes attended City College, and she did postgraduate study in psychotherapy and psychoanalysis at Boston, Yeshiva and New York Universities. Since 1961 she had trained psychologists and psychiatrists.         At her death she was a participant in postdoctoral programs at Adelphi and New York universities. She was also a faculty member and supervisor in the psychiatry department at Mount Sinai Medical Center's School of Medicine and chairwoman of the New York State Psychological Association's Committee on Public Information.         In 1976, Dr. Denes published her first book, ''In Necessity and Sorrow: Life and Death in an Abortion Hospital,'' which a reviewer for The New York Times Book review called ''a highly emotional anti-abortion tract.'' Many other critics praised the book, and it was published in Austria, England, Germany and Japan.         Dr. Denes is survived by her mother, Margit, and two sons, Gregory Radomisli and Timothy Radomisli, both of New York City.         Interviewed along with with other childhood survivors of the Nazis in 1991, Dr. Denes said she had long struggled to break her silence. ''The hidden children are in a curious position,'' she said. ''They were not deported and they were not killed. So they never felt entitled to talk about their own experiences.         ''Holocaust survivors tend to be totally absorbed with that experience, while hidden children have tried to forget what happened to them.''       
         Mary Leakey, matriarch of the famous fossil-hunting family in Africa whose own reputation in paleoanthropology soared with discoveries of bones, stone tools and the footprints of early human ancestors, died yesterday in Nairobi, Kenya. She was 83.         Her family announced her death but did not give the cause, saying only that she died peacefully.         Over half a century, Mary Leakey labored under the hot African sun, scratching in the dirt for clues to early human physical and cultural evolution. Scientists in her field said she set the standards for documentation and excavation in paleolithic archeology. They spoke of hers as a life of enviable achievement.         ''She was one of the world's great originals,'' said Dr. Alan Walker, an anatomist at Pennsylvania State University who has long excavated fossils with the Leakey family. ''Untrained except in art, she developed techniques of excavation and descriptive archeology and did it all on her own in the middle of Africa. It was an extraordinary life.''         In a biography of the Leakey family, ''Ancestral Passions,'' published last year by Simon & Schuster, Virginia Morell characterized Mary Leakey as ''the grande dame of archeology.''         Beginning in the 1930's, Mary Leakey and her late husband, Louis, awakened the world to Africa's primary place in human origins with their spectacular discoveries and increasingly pushed back the time of those origins much earlier than had been thought. Until then, many scientists still believed the human birthplace would be found in Asia.         She discovered the skull of Proconsul africanus, an apelike ancestor of both apes and early humans that lived about 25 million years ago. In 1959, her discovery of a well-preserved skull of a hominid, a member of the extended human ancestral family, brought fame and substantial financial backing to the Leakeys. A few years later, the two Leakeys uncovered the fossils of the first known member of the genus Homo habilis, or ''able man,'' in recognition of the many stone tools found among the bones.         From then on, the name Leakey was synonymous with the study of human origins. The flamboyant Louis seemed to know just where to look to find revealing fossils; the envious spoke of ''Leakey's luck.'' Meanwhile, Mary Leakey worked in her husband's shadow, seeing to the plodding excavations and meticulous documentation of their finds.         ''Louis was always a better publicist than scientist,'' said E. Barton Worthington, a fellow of the Royal Geographical Society in London and former African explorer. ''Mary was the real fossil hunter.''         After Louis Leakey's death in 1972, Mary Leakey overcame some of her natural shyness to assume direction of the family fossil enterprise, which by then one of their sons, Richard, joined as an expedition leader. Her operations centered on Olduvai Gorge and Laetoli, both in Tanzania. On the arid plain of Laetoli, she made her most sensational discovery in 1978: the earliest footprints of a human ancestor.         A Playful Moment, But a Fateful One         As often happens, the discovery of the prints was made by chance -- more Leakey luck. While tossing dried elephant dung in a playful camp fight, one scientist on Mrs. Leakey's expedition fell down and saw in the gray surface some curious indentations. They were imprints of raindrops and animals, now hardened to stone and recently exposed by erosion and weathering.         After further exploration, scientists determined that the tracks were made about 3.7 million years ago. The animals had walked over volcanic ash when it was damp from rain, leaving impressions of their feet. The wet ash set like concrete and was later covered over by more ash and silt. There the tracks remained to be found by dung-throwing scientists.         It was two years before a scientist uncovered a heel print that hinted of an even more significant find. It seemed to belong to a hominid. On Aug. 2, 1978, Mrs. Leakey spent three hours examining one of the clearest of these prints. She cleaned the crevices of the print with a small brush and dental pick. All the important elements were preserved: heel, toes and arch. She appraised the print from every possible angle.         Finally, Mrs. Leakey stood up from her work, lit a cigar and announced, ''Now this really is something to put on the mantelpiece.''         She was at last sure that a hominid had left this print and a trail of prints extending more than 75 feet across the plain. Two and possibly three individuals had walked this way 3.7 million years ago: the larger one, presumably a male; the smaller one, presumably female, and an even smaller individual, perhaps their child, whose prints are sometimes superimposed on the others.         In a Footprint a Clue To Human Behavior         Somewhere along the way, as Mrs. Leakey noted, the female appeared to pause and turn to her left. She might have sensed danger, possibly from a predator or the rumble of a volcanic eruption nearby. Then she resumed her walk to the north.         ''This motion, so intensely human, transcends time,'' Mrs. Leakey wrote in the National Geographic magazine. ''A remote ancestor -- just as you or I -- experienced a moment of doubt.''         These evocative footprints are the earliest known traces of human behavior. At the time, the discovery established that human ancestors had begun walking upright much earlier than previously thought, long before the evolution of larger brains. Whether upright walking preceded the larger brain, or vice versa, was still a much-debated issue among scholars.         With the discovery of a species called Australopithecus afarensis, based on the famous Lucy skeleton, the most likely identity of these prehistoric strollers was established. The species lived between 3.9 million and 3 million years ago, and from the fossils paleontologists have determined that they were as capable of walking upright as modern humans.         ''I think it's the most important find in view of human evolution,'' Mrs. Leakey was quoted by The Associated Press as saying in an interview in September. ''I was really looking for tools, but we never found any at the site.''         In Stone Age Art, Two Interests Merged         She also looked back fondly on what she called another highlight of her career. She was a budding artist before she met and later married Mr. Leakey, when she turned to fossil hunting and archeology. In 1951, her two interests merged briefly.         Mrs. Leakey recorded on drawing paper some 1,600 of the thousands of late Stone Age paintings in the Kondoa-Irangi region of Tanzania. The work gave her ''a great sense of happiness and well-being,'' she wrote in her autobiography, ''Disclosing the Past,'' published in 1984, because the drawings afforded a glimpse of the lives of the hunter-gatherers who painted them. ''No amounts of stone and bone could yield the kinds of information that the paintings gave so freely,'' she said.         One of her last books was a collection of these Stone Age drawings, entitled ''Africa's Vanishing Art: the Rock Paintings of Tanzania'' and published in 1983.         Art and, to some extent, prehistory were part of Mary Leakey's heritage. She was born Mary Douglas Nicol on Feb. 6, 1913 in London. Her father, Erskine Nicol, was a prolific and fairly successful landscape painter, as was his father before him. Her mother, Cecilia Marion Frere, was a descendant of John Frere, a British prehistorian who in 1797 first recognized Stone Age flint implements as primitive tools and weapons.         After World War I, the family spent months each year in Switzerland, France or Italy, where the father painted and took Mary to archeological ruins and the caves painted by Cro-Magnon hunters. As she said, this was the source of her early interest in archeology.         ''Basically, I have been compelled by curiosity,'' she wrote in her autobiography. But formal education was not for her.         Bored by class work and her fellow students, Mary was expelled from two schools and so, with attending a university out of the question, decided to pursue independent studies in drawing and archeology. ''I had never passed a single school exam, and clearly never would,'' she wrote.         At the age of 20, Mary Nicol, a sometime illustrator of stone tools and occasional participant in archeological digs, met Louis Leakey, 10 years her senior, married and an established figure in African archeology with a position at Cambridge University. He asked her to help him with drawings for a book, and she readily agreed. A romance followed, and then scandal.         Scandal in Cambridge Led to Magic of Africa         They would marry as soon as his divorce came through. Meanwhile, they did nothing to conceal the intimacy of their relationship, living together for more than a year in a cottage near Cambridge. This eventually cost him his post at Cambridge, the memory of which was dancing lightly through Mary Leakey's mind years later as she walked up the aisle at Cambridge to receive an honorary doctorate degree.         The two were married in 1936 and set out for Africa, where he had grown up as the son of British missionaries. As Mrs. Leakey wrote later, she was never the same again after ''Africa had cast its spell'' on her. Much of their marriage was spent at dig sites. ''Given the chance, I'd rather be in a tent than in a house,'' she said in a recent interview with Associated Press.         It was a discovery by the Leakeys in 1959 that, according to Dr. F. Clark Howell of the University of California at Berkeley, marked ''the beginnings of paleoanthropology in a modern sense.'' The pace of exploration quickened. Geologists and anatomists joined the quest, a multidisciplinary approach that the Leakeys did much to promote.         On a July day in 1959, as Louis lay ill in camp, Mary stumbled on some teeth and part of a jaw on a slope of Olduvai Gorge. Rushing back to her husband, she exclaimed, ''I've found him -- found our man.''         How the couple celebrated is not recorded. But in her autobiography, Mrs. Leakey wrote that after an earlier major find they ''cast aside care'' and that was how their son Philip ''came to join our family.''         The 1959 discovery turned out to be a 1.8 million-year-old fossil known as the ''nutcracker man'' because of its huge jaws and molar teeth. It was later designated Australopithecus boisei.         As Two Lives Diverged, A New Independence         From 1968 until Louis Leakey's death in 1972, he and Mary Leakey were separated. He spent more and more of his time in the celebrity whirl, raising money and lecturing,  while she stuck to her digging at Olduvai. She was becoming more independent, opposing some of her husband's more sensational interpretations of discoveries.         ''I ended by losing my professional respect for Louis; and it had been very great indeed,'' she wrote. ''Once that was so I was no longer able to offer the concurrence and unquestioning adulation he now seemed to demand.''         Another unsettling episode in her life was the controversy between her and Richard Leakey, on one side, and Dr. Donald C. Johanson, the discoverer of Lucy, on the other. She insisted on the removal of her name from the joint authorship of a paper that made assumptions about the place of the Lucy species human evolution.         Mrs. Leakey retired from fieldwork in 1983, still smoking small Cuban cigars and accompanied by her beloved Dalmatians. Her honors were many for a woman who never finished high school: medals from the National Geographic Society, the Geological Society of London and the Royal Swedish Academy and many honorary degrees.         She is survived by her three sons, Jonathan, Richard and Philip, all of Kenya, and by 10 grandchildren.       
         Amelia Agostino del Rio, a professor, author and longtime head of the Spanish department at Barnard College, died on Wednesday in Spring Lake, N.J., where she lived. She was 100.         Mrs. del Rio wrote more than 45 books of poetry, essays, plays, short stories and art history, and, in collaboration with her husband, Angel del Rio, ''Antologia de la Literatura Espanola,'' which was considered to be the Bible of Spanish literature.         She was born in Yauco in Puerto Rico. In 1918, after teaching in local high schools, she moved to New York. Later she worked her way through Vassar College by teaching Spanish, and graduated as a member of Phi Beta Kappa in 1922. She received a master's degree from Columbia University.         In 1929, she began teaching at Barnard, where she was head of the Spanish department from 1941 to 1962. While at Barnard, she often acted in Spanish plays, playing a leading role in Federico Garcia Lorca's ''House of Bernardo Alba.''         During the 1940's and 50's, she and her husband were known for opening their house to such Spanish intellectuals and writers as Pedro Salinas, Jorge Guillen, Camilo Jose Cela, Gabriel Mistral and Garcia Lorca. Recently she had been writing her recollections of Garcia Lorca's time in New York, including his visit with the del Rios in Shandaken, N.Y., in the summer of 1929.         In the 1970's, she returned to Puerto Rico, where she continued teaching and and where she wrote for local newspapers. She founded the Museo de Reproducciones Artisticas in Bayamon, P.R. The museum opened in 1985.         She was honored by Mayor Robert Wagner with a key to the city of New York and by Juan Carlos I, the King of Spain, with the highest civilian honor in that country. She also received the Citizen of the Year Award from the Institute of Puerto Rico.         She is survived by a daughter, Carmen R. de Pinies of Spring Lake;  six grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.         Correction:  December 17, 1996, Tuesday         An obituary on Saturday about a professor, author and longtime head of the Spanish department at Barnard College misspelled her maiden name. She was Amelia Agostini del Rio, not Agostino.       
         Rebecca Drucker Bernstien, a journalist, critic and feminist who was a fixture in New York City literary circles from 1910 to 1950, died of heart failure on Dec. 28. A resident of Gramercy Park for the last 45 years, she was 105.         Mrs. Bernstien, who emigrated to the city from Russia when she was 3 and who  grew up on the Lower East Side and in Brooklyn, was closely associated with a group of artists and writers who rose to prominence before World War II, including those in the Algonquin Round Table.         Beginning in 1912, when she began working as a secretary and reader at The American Magazine and met such writers as John Reed, Ida Tarbell and Walter Lippmann, she combined literary zeal with political advocacy. And as a reporter  at The New York Tribune and an assistant to the critic Heywood Broun, she wrote  book and theater reviews from 1919 to 1922 under the byline Rebecca Drucker and  the initials "R. D."         During the same years, she became a charter member of the Lucy Stone League,  a group founded by Mr. Broun's wife, Ruth Hale, that encouraged married women to keep their names. Its credo was, "My name is the symbol of my identity and must  not be lost."         During the 1930's, she worked as a press agent for several theatrical producers and companies, including Morris Gest and the Ethiopian Theater Company, and founded the League of Women Shoppers, a consumer advocacy group.         Mrs. Bernstien was married for 63 years to Oscar Bernstien, a founder of the  law firm O'Dwyer & Bernstien, who died in 1974. She is survived by several nieces and nephews.       
         Josephine Patterson Albright, who flew the mail, shot tigers in India, covered Chicago crime in journalism's colorful "Front Page" era, ran an Illinois dairy and pig farm, bred horses in Wyoming, wrote a column about her family and  helped establish a foundation for journalists, died on Monday at her home in Woodstock, Vt. She was 82.         A daughter, Alice Arlen of Manhattan, said the death was caused by complications after a stroke.         Mrs. Albright was a member of one of the most prominent families in American journalism. Her father, Joseph Medill Patterson, founded The Daily News in New York and helped found The Chicago Tribune. Her aunt, Eleanor Medill Patterson, published The Washington Times-Herald, and her older sister, Alicia Patterson, founded, published and edited Newsday.         Like Alicia, who was seven years her senior, Josephine was told by her father that journalism was not for women. Both proved him wrong.         When Josephine earned her spurs in Chicago in the early 1930's, interviewing  killers like George (Baby Face) Nelson and covering murders and the criminal courts, she worked not for her father's newspaper but for a rival paper, The Chicago Daily News, whose staff members served as models for the characters in the classic Ben Hecht-Charles MacArthur comedy "The Front Page."         In "Ladies of the Press" (Harper & Brothers, 1936), Ishbel Ross wrote, "She sailed along successfully under her own steam, in spite of the professional handicap of being born into a noted newspaper family."         Josephine Patterson was born in Libertyville, Ill., on Dec. 2, 1913, and educated at the Foxcroft School in Middleburg, Va. Although her father disapproved of women in journalism, he did approve of women as pilots, and she got her pilot's license at the age of 16. Before her 18th birthday, she was the  youngest pilot flying the mail route between Chicago and St. Louis.         But Josephine's career as a commercial mail pilot lasted only a few months. At 18, in the midst of her debutante party, she decided to fly with Alicia to India to hunt tigers. Without telling their mother, the two young women hopscotched their way across the world, dancing every night.         When they arrived in India, Josephine, who was later to become an ardent animal rights activist and naturalist, quickly bagged a tiger.         Alicia, who was supposed to shoot the tiger, was angry. She told her sister to stay out of the next hunt. So Josephine went on the next hunt carrying only a book. She was sitting in a tree reading when a leopard bounded up behind her. Josephine threw the book and hit the leopard in the nose. Alicia finished it off.         In 1936, Josephine married Jay Frederick Reeve, a Chicago lawyer she met while covering the courts. At that time she operated a dairy and pig farm that became the Hawthorne-Melody Dairy, a major Illinois enterprise.         In the mid-1940's, after a divorce, she moved to Dubois, Wyo., bought a stallion from an Indian reservation and began raising horses.         In 1946, in Red Lodge, Mont., she married Ivan Albright, an artist of the Chicago school who was known for his realistic paintings. The couple traveled extensively, and Mrs. Albright's travels fostered her enthusiasm for geography.  Near the end of her life, she sponsored a statewide geography bee that was held  in every Vermont school district.         In 1949, Mrs. Albright returned to journalism for three years as the author of a weekly Newsday column, "Life With Junior," which chronicled her foibles and successes in rearing her four children.         In 1963, she and her husband moved to Woodstock, where she obtained a bachelor of arts degree from Goddard College in Plainfield, Vt.         Mr. Albright, whose centennial is to be observed next year with retrospectives at the Art Institute of Chicago and the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, died in 1983.         After Alicia Patterson died in 1963, Mrs. Albright helped establish and became a major benefactor of the Alicia Patterson Foundation, which awards fellowships to print journalists and photographers.         Mrs. Albright was also a supporter of the Pentangle Theater in Woodstock, the River City Arts and White River Opera House in White River Junction, Vt., the Hood Museum in Hanover, N.H., and the Art Institute of Chicago. Dartmouth College named her a Lathrop Fellow in honor of her support for its arts collection.         Besides her daughter Alice, Mrs. Albright is survived by another daughter, Dinah Albright Rojek of South Woodstock, Vt.; two sons, Joseph Medill Patterson  Albright of Moscow and Adam Medill Albright of Richmond, Mass., 10 grandchildren and 2 great-grandchildren.       
         Marcia Davenport, a biographer of Mozart and best-selling novelist, died on Tuesday in a hospital in Monterey, Calif. She was 92 and lived in Pebble Beach,  Calif.         Mrs. Davenport's last book was her autobiography, "Too Strong for Fantasy" (1967). In a review in The New York Times Book Review, Ellen Moers called it "a  compelling production" and said "the gift for old-fashioned, unadulterated romance which made several of her novels best sellers (and one a Greer Garson movie) does not fail her now." Mrs. Davenport did little writing after the 1970's.         Her best-known book is her biography "Mozart," which came out in 1932, and has been continuously in print since then, most recently from the University of  Pittsburgh Press.         When it appeared, Herbert Gorman praised it highly in The New York Times Book Review, writing that Mrs. Davenport "gives a vivid and convincing portrait of the child prodigy who developed into the man-genius, a portrait that does not romanticize Mozart too much and leaves the reader convinced of the reality of the figure with whom he has passed through a career of hard work, poverty, neglect and few (but astounding) triumphs."         Mrs. Davenport's best-known work of fiction was her best-selling 1942 novel "Valley of Decision," which covers the years 1873 to 1941 and focuses on Mary Rafferty, who comes into the lives of the Scott family of Pittsburgh, owners of the Scott Iron Works, as a maid. The book also weaves the Scotts' personal lives in with steel-industry and United States history. The book was made into a 1945 film, with the same title, starring Greer Garson and Gregory Peck.         Another of Mrs. Davenport's best-selling novels, "East Side, West Side" (1947), was one of the last works inspired and edited by Maxwell Perkins of Scribner's publishing house. The novel concerned a woman in Manhattan's high society whose marriage is threatened by her husband's infidelities. The 1949 film adaptation starred Barbara Stanwyck, James Mason and Ava Gardner.         Mrs. Davenport's first novel, "Of Lena Geyer" (1936), was recalled by one reviewer in the 1980's as a "a vivid portrayal of a great opera singer." Her last novel was "The Constant Image" (1960), which described an extramarital affair in Milan.         Her autobiography has vivid descriptions of music, even of the acoustics in Carnegie Hall years ago. In that book, she praises one particular box on the second tier at Carnegie Hall, saying "Carnegie Hall is glorious," but "nowhere else in the old house is the sonority so total, the instruments, together or individually, so brilliant and penetrating. The sound comes out of the walls and surrounds one like a cloak."         Marcia Gluck Davenport was a native New Yorker. In various biographical accounts, she refrained from giving her father's name. Her mother, Alma Gluck, rose from humble origins to fame as a soprano.         Mrs. Davenport wrote in her autobiography that her parents, whose marriage ended in divorce, "were part of the tidal wave of emigration from the Russian Pale and Eastern Europe which in a generation swept a million people, fleeing persecutions, pogroms and conscriptions, onto the shores of Manhattan Island."         Her mother later married the violinist Efrem Zimbalist. Young Marcia went to  private schools in Pennsylvania and attended Wellesley College. She was on the staff of The New Yorker from 1928 to 1931 before becoming a freelance lecturer,  music critic and commentator as well as an author.         Mrs. Davenport's first marriage, to Frank D. Clarke, ended in divorce, as did her 1929 marriage to Russell Wheeler Davenport, a novelist who became a prominent editor at Time Inc.         She is survived by a daughter, Cornelia Davenport Schwartz of Harrisville, N.H., six grandchildren and seven great-grandchildren.       
         Pam Conrad, the author of "Prairie Songs," "Stonewords: A Ghost Story" and other works for children and young adults, died on Monday at her home in Rockville Center, L.I. She was 48.         The cause was breast cancer, said a spokeswoman at the Maria Carvainis literary agency.         Ms. Conrad was born in New York City. She graduated from the New School for  Social Research in 1984.         After writing "I Don't Live Here!" (1983), she won critical praise for "Prairie Songs" (1985), about a pioneer woman who goes mad after moving from New York to the plains of Nebraska.         Ms. Conrad explored sometimes disturbing themes for young readers in her fiction. Her novel "Our House: Stories of Levittown," was a finalist for the 1995 Newbery Medal. She wrote one novel for adults, "Pumpkin Moon" (1994).         She is survived by two daughters, Sarah, of Rockville Center, and Johanna, of Melbourne, Fla.; her parents, Robert and Doris Stampf of Lancaster, Pa.; two brothers, David, of Shoreham, L.I., and Jonathan, of North Valley Stream, L.I.,  and a sister, Melissa, of Ronkonkoma, L.I.       
         Karen Machover, a psychologist who developed a method of personality analysis based on an interpretation of drawings of the human figure, died on Monday at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 93.         Like the Rorschach inkblots, the Machover test is intended to serve as a sort of screen on which people project their thoughts, anxieties and conflicts. First, the test taker is told simply to draw a person. Next, the subject draws a figure of the opposite sex. Then a personality description is prepared from an analysis of such features as the figures' size, stance and position on the page.         Mrs. Machover wrote a book on her research that is still in print, "Personality Projection in the Drawing of the Human Figure: A Method of Personality Investigation" (Charles C. Thomas, 1949).         Born in Minsk, Belarus, Mrs. Machover came to the United States in 1910 with  her mother and four sisters. She worked for many years at Bellevue Hospital and  then at Kings County Hospital, retiring in 1970. She also maintained a private practice as a psychotherapist into the mid-80's.         In addition, she taught at Brooklyn College, SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn and New York University, from which she had received her master's degree in psychology. It was at N.Y.U. in the 1930's that she met Solomon Machover, a student who became her husband. He died in 1976.         Mrs. Machover is survived by a son, Robert Machover of Milford, N.J., and a grandson.       
         Suzanne Prou, a French novelist and militant opponent of anti-Semitism, died  in Paris, where she lived, during the night of Dec. 29-30. She was 75.         Le Monde reported her death on Tuesday, without giving its cause, and called  her "a novelist of bittersweet nostalgia."         Mrs. Prou (pronounced proo) wrote two dozen novels. The best known is "La Terrasse des Bernardini," or "The Bernardini Terrace," published in 1973. It won the Prix Renaudot, one of several French literary awards her works received.         Reviewing that book, William Cole wrote in the Saturday Review, "Madame Prou  weaves an incredibly fine net, the strands of which are passion, deceit, sadism, pride, seduction and burning hate." And the New Yorker said that she made "the charged atmosphere of decaying provincial life as fascinating as a drop of pond  water viewed through the lens of a microscope."         Her first novel, "Les Patapharis," which appeared in France in 1966 and was later published in English as "The Patapharis Affair," won the Prix Femina and was praised by Martin Levin in The New York Times Book Review as a "delicately shadowed work of art." Her last book, "L'Album de Famille," came out last year.         Mrs. Prou embraced a variety of causes during her life. During the German occupation of France she took a stand against anti-Semitism, helping to produce  an underground newspaper that denounced it. She was subsequently made a chevalier of the Legion of Honor.         Over the years, she was also an ardent feminist and supporter of human rights. In 1994, in a long program about AIDS that was broadcast on all French television channels, she gave a harrowing account of how her 26-year-old granddaughter, Erica, had died of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome the previous year.         The novelist was born Suzanne Doreau, the daughter of an army officer and a teacher, in a village near St.-Tropez on the French Riviera. She grew up partly  in Algeria and Indochina, pursued university studies in France -- in Marseilles  and Aix-en-Provence -- received a degree in literature in 1942 and was a schoolteacher for a time.         Her husband, Charles Prou, died earlier. They married in 1944 and had a daughter, Anne-Francoise.       
         Jane Miller MacRae, an artist who wrote and illustrated children's books, died on Tuesday at her home in Hobe Sound, Fla. She was 89.         Best known under her maiden name, Jane Miller, she was the author and illustrator of books that often depicted animals in human settings. Her works included "Mogo Mouse" (1932), "Lulu" (1941), "Miss Lizzie" (1943) and "The Ill-Tempered Tiger" (1957).         Among the books she illustrated were "A Dog of His Own" (1941), "A Dance for Susie" (1953), "Andrew the Lion Farmer" (1959) and "Scrappy the Pup" (1960), by  the poet John Ciardi.         She had shows of her oil paintings in New York at the Sagittarius Gallery in  1959 and the Bodley Gallery in 1961.         She is survived by her husband, Cameron; a son, Cameron F. MacRae 3d, of New  York City, and two grandchildren.       
         Liz Williamson, a jazz dance authority, died on Wednesday at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan. She was 76 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a heart attack, said her daughter, Wonza Sinclair.         Ms. Williamson performed with Alvin Ailey's first company in 1958, dancing in the premiere of "Blues Suite," which started Ailey's choreographic career in  New York. She also danced with Donald McKayle and the Merry-Go-Rounders, and performed as a solo artist. She appeared on television, in films and in musicals, including City Center revivals of "Finian's Rainbow" and "Carmen Jones."         Ms. Williamson was born in Winston-Salem, N.C.She received a bachelor's degree in romance languages from Radcliffe College and a master's degree in dance from New York University. She wrote about the history of jazz dancing and  taught around the world, at schools and festivals that included the International Ballet Competition in Jackson, Miss., in 1986 and 1990. In 1973, she was the first artist-in-residence at the Jacob's Pillow Dance Festival, where she choreographed "The Many Faces of Jazz," a piece with a cast of 65 dancers. She continued to teach up until her death.         Ms. Williamson's husband, William Elliott Williamson, died in 1991.         In addition to her daughter, of Brooklyn, she is survived by a grandson.       
         Barbara Skelton, a writer whose best subject was her own life of passionate abandon, died on Saturday in Worcestershire in western England from a brain tumor, The Times of London reported on Monday. She was 79.         Her two volumes of memoirs -- "Tears Before Bedtime" (1987) and "Weep No More" (1989) -- were savored for their malicious descriptions of her three husbands and many lovers, including King Farouk of Egypt and a police officer who came to investigate a burglary at her home.         She was married three times: to the literary critic Cyril Connolly from 1950 to 1956; to the publisher George Weidenfeld from 1956 to 1961, and briefly to Derek Jackson, a newspaper heir, in 1966.         She wrote two novels, "A Young Girl's Touch" (1956) and "A Love Match" (1969), though the latter was withdrawn because of threats of legal action by a  former friend. Her two memoirs became the basis for a 1995 film.       
         Felice N. Schwartz, who was active for more than three decades in the advancement of women in the workplace, and whose writing focused debate over the career model known as the "mommy track," died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 71.         She died of heart failure after a long illness, said her son Tony.         Mrs. Schwartz was the founder of Catalyst, a national organization that was  dedicated to helping women choose and advance careers and that later promoted the participation of women in corporations and their recruitment on corporate boards. She remained its president for 30 years, retiring in 1993.         She prompted a national debate in 1989 with an article in the Harvard Business Review that asserted it cost companies more to employ women than men. She noted that women's careers were often interrupted, or ended, when they had children and suggested that employers create policies to help mothers balance career and family responsibilities by giving them more flexibility in work hours and providing high-quality day care.         An uproar began almost immediately. Her proposed alternative career track came to be called the "mommy track." Detractors voiced the fear that by raising  the higher cost issue, women would not be hired and promoted and that all women  would be left with the primary responsibility for child care. Mrs. Schwartz said her views were widely misinterpreted.         "I violated the politically correct thing by saying that women are not just like men, " Mrs. Schwartz maintained in an interview in The Boston Globe in 1992. "What I said then and still say is that women face many, many obstacles in the workplace that men do not face. I was saying to that group of men at the top, 'Rather than let women's talents go to waste, do something about it.' "         She believed, she said, that there should be a parent track. "When a woman is faced with doing all the housework, all the child care and then full-time work in the corporate area, she is stunted. The same applies to men."         The daughter of Albert and Rose Nierenberg of New York, she first became involved in social causes while an undergraduate at Smith College. In 1945, she  founded the National Scholarship Service and Fund for Negro Students. The organization lobbied colleges and universities to open their doors to minorities and provided financial aid for college bound African-American students.         Catalyst, founded in 1962 after Mrs. Schwartz had spent a decade at home raising her children, focused in its early years on lobbying employers to allow  women to combine family and part-time work. The organization pioneered several job-sharing pilot projects in which two women shared a full-time job. It also undertook studies on family issues in the workplace.         In 1968, Mrs. Schwartz wrote "How to Go to Work When Your Husband Is Against  It, Your Children Aren't Old Enough and There's Nothing You Can Do Anyhow." A second book, "Breaking With Tradition: Women and Work, the New Facts of Life," was published in 1992. Last month, she finished writing "The Armchair Activist:  Simple Yet Powerful Ways to Fight the Radical Right." It will be published this  fall.         She was married in 1946 to Irving L. Schwartz, a scientist, educator and physician.         During the early years of her marriage, Mrs. Schwartz and her husband had what might have been one of the early commuter marriages. The family moved to Cincinnati where Dr. Schwartz had been offered a post at a medical school. Mrs.  Schwartz, who was planning the organization that later became Catalyst, believed that it had to be launched in New York. She returned with her three children and Dr. Schwartz spent the next two years flying back and forth on weekends.         She is survived by her husband; a daughter, Cassie Arnold of Washington; two  sons, Tony Schwartz of New York City and James Schwartz of Boston; a brother, Theodore Nierenberg of Armonk, N.Y., and five grandchildren.       
         Judith Kaplan Eisenstein, an author, musicologist and composer, died yesterday of a heart attack in Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Md., where she was being treated for a broken hip. She was 86 and lived in Silver Spring, Md.         The oldest daughter of Rabbi Mordecai Kaplan, the founder of the Reconstructionist branch of Judaism, Dr. Eisenstein was the first woman to have  a bat mitzvah, in 1922.         No thunder sounded," she said in 1992, recalling the ceremony. "No lightning struck."         But opening to women the bar mitzvah rite that had long marked the passage of Jewish males into religious adulthood proved to be the first of many changes broadening the role of women in Judaism, including in recent years their ordination as rabbis.         Today the bat mitzvah ceremony, usually carried out when girls are 12, is an  established practice within the Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist branches of Judaism, and parallel celebrations are common in some quarters of Orthodox Judaism as well.         From 1929 to 1954, Dr. Eisenstein taught music education and the history of Jewish music at Jewish Theological Seminary's Teacher's Institute, now known as  the Albert A. List College of Jewish Studies in Manhattan.         While there she published a Jewish songbook for children, "Gateway to Jewish  Song," which was followed by other books of Jewish music and musical history for young people.  From 1942 to 1974, she wrote seven cantatas on Jewish themes, among them the frequently performed, "What Is Torah," which she wrote with her husband, Rabbi Ira Eisenstein.         In 1959, at the age of 50, Dr. Eisenstein, who had earned a master's degree in music education at Columbia University's Teachers College, began work for her Ph.D. at the School of Sacred Music of Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of  Religion in New York. After receiving her degree, she taught there from 1966 to  1979, teaching as well at the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College in Philadelphia.         The smallest branch of Judaism, Reconstructionism views Judaism as what Dr. Eisenstein's father, Rabbi Kaplan, called the "evolving religious civilization of the Jewish people," emphasizing the cultural and moral heritage of the Jewish people but not traditional supernatural and theistic beliefs.         Dr. Eisenstein, who was born on Sept. 10, 1909, studied at the Institute of Musical Art, now the Juilliard School. An early marriage ended in divorce and in 1934 she married Rabbi Eisenstein, the assistant rabbi at the Society for the Advancement of Judaism, the Manhattan synagogue that her father headed.         She collaborated with her husband on five of her cantatas. In February 1952,  on the eve of a Jewish Music Festival in New York, Dr. Eisenstein defended the idea of a distinctive Jewish music. While Jews had borrowed much musically from  the nations and peoples they had lived among, she wrote in The New York Times, the music of Jews "bears the unmistakable stamp of their own peculiar wistfulness, puritanism, or wry humor."         When she was 82, 12 years past the biblical life span of 70, Dr. Eisenstein had a second bat mitzvah, at which she was also honored by feminist and Jewish leaders, including Betty Friedan, Letty Cottin Pogrebin, Ruth W. Messinger, Elizabeth Holtzman, Rabbi Rachel Cowan and Blu Greenberg.         At that time, Dr. Eistenstein expressed disappointment that bat mitzvah ceremonies, like bar mitzvahs, were often overshadowed by lavish parties. "Bat mitzvah began not just as a statement of feminism," she said, "but as a statement of dedication to something larger than oneself."         In addition to her husband, Dr. Eisenstein is survived by two daughters, Miriam Eisenstein of Gaithersburg, Md., and Ann Eisenstein of Manhattan; three sisters, Hadassah Musher and Selma Goldman, both of Manhattan, and Naomi Wenner  of Chevy Chase, Md., and one grandchild.       
         Lady Caroline Blackwood, a writer of wry, macabre novels and essays, and a beguiling Anglo-Irish aristocrat who married the painter Lucian Freud and the poet Robert Lowell, died yesterday in the Mayfair Hotel in Manhattan, where she  stayed the last few weeks while she was ill. She was 64.         The cause was cancer, said her daughter Ivana Lowell.         She published nine books and was best known and much admired in Britain. Among her works was "The Stepdaughter," a short epistolary novel about an abusive woman abandoned by her husband and left with his hideous daughter. Another novel, "The Fate of Mary Rose," was about an increasingly deranged mother's fatal obsession with her daughter's safety.         Her most recent book, "The Last of the Duchess," was an eccentric, Kafkaesque account of her vain attempt to visit the ailing Duchess of Windsor. It revolved  mostly around the Duchess's powerful lawyer, Suzanne Blum, portrayed in the book as obsessed with her client to the point of erotic fantasy.         British critics noted the "brilliant irony" and "rather brilliant bitchiness" of her writing, comparing it with the work of Muriel Spark and Iris Murdoch, among others. In her prose and in person, she exhibited a razor-sharp wit and offbeat sensibility. A dramatic woman, delicately built, intense and vulnerable, she was a famous beauty in her youth, and in later years remained striking for her extraordinary eyes, which Mr. Freud made into giant spheres in his hypnotic  portraits.         One portrait played a curious role in her life, as she related in an interview last year. During the 1950's, when she and Mr. Freud were living in Paris, "Lucian got a call out of nowhere from a mistress of Picasso's who asked  him if he could come round and paint her," she said. "The woman wanted to make Picasso jealous. Lucian very politely said maybe he could paint her portrait later, but not now because he happened to be in the midst of doing his wife's portrait."         That picture, she said, was "Girl in Bed," a work that years later also figured in the death of Robert Lowell, her third husband. Their marriage was in  tatters when, the story goes, Lowell left her in Ireland and flew to New York City. When his taxi arrived at his apartment on West 67th Street, the driver found Lowell slumped over. A doorman summoned Elizabeth Hardwick, the writer and editor, whom Lowell had left to marry Lady Caroline; she happened to live in the same apartment house. Ms. Hardwick opened the taxi door to be confronted with her former husband's corpse. He was clutching "Girl in Bed."         Lady Caroli'e moved amo'g several worlds: from the insular Anglo-Irish upper  classes, which she largely rejected for the smart set of postwar England and then for the liberal intelligentsia of New York City in the 1960's and 70's. During much of the last 35 years, she lived in the United States, splitting her time in recent years between an apartment in Manhattan and a house in Sag Harbor, L.I., that once belonged to President Chester A. Arthur.         Lady Caroline Hamilton Temple Blackwood was born in London on July 16, 1931.  She was descended on her father's side from the great 18th-century dramatist Richard Brinsley Sheridan and was a Guinness on her mother's side. (She liked to joke that she found stout undrinkable.) She grew up in the ancestral stone mansion, Clandeboye, in County Down in Northern Ireland.         Her great-grandfather, Lord Dufferin, was an eminent Victorian rumored to have been Disraeli's illegitimate son. Queen Victoria made him Viceroy of India, where he used to sit on his throne, fanned by peacock feathers. "Kipling loved my great-grandfather and wrote lots of very bad poems to him," Lady Caroline said. "He had a fatal effect on poets."         Her mother, Maureen, the Marchioness of Dufferin and Ava, is a flamboyant figure in London who, according to one newspaper account, gave a black eye to Sir Oswald Mosley, the English Fascist, after he made a pass at her in Antibes.  Her father, Basil, the Marquess, was a friend of Evelyn Waugh and part of the circle described in "Brideshead Revisited." He was killed in Burma during World  War II, when Caroline was 12.         Like other women of her class, she skipped college; she moved to London and worked for Claud Cockburn, the influential left-wing journalist. She recalled meeting Mr. Freud at that time at a party memorable because the painter Francis  Bacon caused a row when he hooted down Princess Margaret, who had just started singing "Let's Do It." She and Mr. Freud then became part of the group that included Bacon, Cyril Connolly and the other artists and writers who gathered nightly to drink at the Gargoyle and Colony Clubs.         When her marriage to Mr. Freud ended in 1956, she installed herself at the Chateau Marmont in Los Angeles. She got a tiny part in the television series "Have Gun Will Travel." Stephen Spender asked her to write an article for Encounter magazine about California beatniks, and it was ' sendup that launched  her writing career.         She next moved to New York and married Israel Citkowitz, an American composer and pianist, and a student of Aaron Copland, 20 years her senior. They were divorced in 1972, when she married Lowell, but they remained close.         During the next years she endured a series of Job-like catastrophes: the death of Citkowitz; Lowell's crippling manic depression and early death; the death from AIDS of her brother, Sheridan, to whom she was very close; the death of her eldest daughter, Natalya, after a drug overdose, and her own bout with cervical cancer, for which she had an operation that left her in constant pain.         Throughout, she maintained her dark humor and creatively transformed her experiences into her novels and essays. "I think it's partly Irish," she once explained. "Irish people are very funny but have this tragic sense.         "As Cal wrote," she added, referring to Lowell, "if there's light at the end  of the tunnel, it's the light of the oncoming train."         In addition to her daughter Ivana, of Manhattan, she is survived by her mother, of London; a sister, Lady Perdita Blackwood, of Ulster; another daughter, Evgenia Citkowitz of Los Angeles, and a son, Sheridan Lowell of Manhattan.       
         Ann Barry, who pursued a freelance writing career while working as an editor  at The New York Times and at The New Yorker, died of cancer on Saturday at the Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 53 and lived in Brooklyn.         Miss Barry, who was born in St. Louis and graduated from St. Louis University, started as an editorial assistant at the The New Yorker in 1967 before moving down the street to The Times in 1975.         While designing and editing the Sunday Arts and Leisure Guide, editing art and dance reviews and designing the daily cultural pages, she began contributing articles to The Times, a career she continued and expanded after she returned to The New Yorker in 1990 as managing editor of the Goings On About Town section.         Although she wrote on a variety of subjects, Miss Barry, who left The New Yorker in 1994, particularly enjoyed writing about the Dordogne region of southwestern France, where, not coincidentally, she owned a vacation home.         Although she could spend only two or three weeks there a year, Miss Barry kept such meticulous track of her intense short-term experiences that she turned them into a book, "At Home in France: Tales of an American and Her House Abroad." It is being published by Ballantine next month.         She is survived by a brother, Gene, of Palm Harbor, Fla.       
         Eleanor Clark, an author best known for the evocative range of her accounts of oystering in Brittany and of the streets of Rome, died on Friday at a retirement home in Boston. She was 82.         Miss Clark, the widow of Robert Penn Warren, was a master stylist whose works won critical acclaim and inspired a devoted private following. Her writings included reviews, essays, children's books and novels.         In a review in The New York Times, Anatole Broyard called a 1975 reissue of  her 1952 book "Rome and the Villa" "perhaps the finest book ever to be written about a city."         But the most telling tributes came from the generations of American and other tourists who followed her steps -- page by dogeared page -- through the city, marveling at each architectural feature that triggered her soaring ruminations on everything from ancient history and early Roman poetry to modern social conditions.         Although she was sometimes described as a travel writer, "Rome and a Villa" is not a traditional travel book. Nor is "The Oysters of Locmariaquer," a somewhat similar book that used oystering in Brittany as a springboard to an excursion through history and culture, and won the 1964 National Book Award for  arts and letters. Each reflected deep scholarship and a lively intuition.         Both in those books and in her norels, including "Baldur's Gate" (1970) and "Camping Out" (1986), Miss Clark seemed especially moved by landscape, an interest that was grounded in her childhood amid the rolling hills around Roxbury, Conn., her daughter, the poet Rosanna Clark, said yesterday.         Born in Los Angeles, Miss Clark was a descendant of early New England settlers. Her father was a mining engineer, and she seems to have inherited her  literary and scholarly bent from her mother, a Vassar graduate steeped in comparative literature.         Miss Clark also attended Vassar and spent much of her time during her college years on visits to Manhattan. She later became a conspicuous part of the city's  intellectual left, writing for The Partisan Review, The New Republic and The Nation. She was viewed as independent-minded with a youthful social conscience and regarded herself for a time as "a Trotskyite sympathizer."         During a trip to Mexico in 1937 she became a translator for Trotsky and was married to one of his secretaries for a brief time.         During World War II she worked for the Office of Strategic Services in Washington, interviewing French and Italian diplomats. It was at a party at Katherine Anne Porter's home in the spring of 1944 that she met Mr. Warren, then in the last stages of an unhappy first marriage.         Although she recounted later that she had pursued him, once confiding that it had taken all her guile to get a simple good-night kiss, at the first meeting he seems to have been more taken with her than she with him.  She left the party with one of his friends, the poet Denis Devlin, and, as Mr. Warren later railed  in recounting the meeting to his children, "a bunch of other drunken Irishmen."         After their marriage in 1952, they traveled widely and found a formula for pursuing their separate literary careers. Working in different studies of the converted 17th-century barn that served as their home in Fairfield, Conn., they  wrote from 9 A.M. to 2 P.M. daily, she using the typewriter in the companionship of their cat, he writing in longhand accompanied by their dog.         When Miss Clark was stricken with macular degeneration and almost totally lost her eyesight (a setback described in "Eyes, Etc.," her 1977 memoir), her husband began reading to her at night. He died in 1989.         In addition to her daughter, of Needham, Mass., she is survived by a son, Gabriel, a sculptor, of Wood River Junction, R.I., and four grandchildren.
