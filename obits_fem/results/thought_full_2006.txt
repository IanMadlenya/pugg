         Candy Barr, an exotic dancer whose hardscrabble life became Texas legend as she befriended Jack Ruby (who killed President John F. Kennedy's assassin), dated a mobster, shot her husband went to prison for drug possession, and starred -- unwillingly, she insisted -- in a famous stag film, died on Friday in Victoria, Tex. She was 70.         The Slavik Funeral Home in Edna, Tex., confirmed the death, but provided no details. The Associated Press said she died of pneumonia.         Miss Barr said she was forced in 1951 at 16 to play the lead in a grainy black-and-white erotic movie titled ''Smart Aleck.'' The plot, such as it is, begins with a traveling salesman luring the teenager from the swimming pool into his motel room.         Al Di Lauro and Gerald Rabkin, in their 1976 book, ''Dirty Movies: An Illustrated History of the Stag Film,'' called it ''the single most popular film of the genre.'' They refer to Miss Barr as ''the first pornographic star'' and liken her to Lenny Bruce as a subverter of official morality. The film was not shown in theaters, but was a hit on the bachelor party and smoker circuit.         Many decades after the film and her subsequent fame as a striptease artist, Miss Barr was listed by Playboy magazine in 1999 as one of the 20th century's most desirable women.         For students of the Kennedy assassination, it is her friendship with Mr. Ruby, a nightclub owner, that is most provocative. They were friends over the years, and seven months before the assassination, he visited Miss Barr after her release from prison and gave her two dachshund puppies. He thought she should breed them.         Miss Barr coached Joan Collins on how to portray an exotic dancer in the 1960 film ''Seven Thieves,'' getting credit as technical adviser. Farrah Fawcett conferred with Miss Barr about playing her in a biographical film but never did.         She was born Juanita Dale Slusher on July 6, 1935, in Edna, Tex. Though she told Inside Detective magazine in 1959 that she was fed up with notoriety and hated being called Candy Barr, she went back and forth and never really relinquished the name. At her last public appearance in 1998, to open the Ruby Room at a Dallas club, she was Candy.         As a young child, she said in an interview with Oui magazine in 1976, she was molested by a male babysitter. When she was 9, her mother died. Her father remarried, and she said the harsh discipline of her stepmother impelled her to run away when she was in the ninth grade. A marriage at 14 to a safecracker ended in divorce.         She said a man she met at a club forced her to do the blue movie, sometimes saying he drugged her.         ''I was taken, done and that was it,'' she told Oui.         She dyed her hair blond and progressed from cigarette girl to an exotic dancer well known enough to require a flashy name. She loved chocolate, hence Candy Barr.         She shot her second of four husbands in the stomach in January 1956 after he came home drunk and threatened her. He said that he deserved it, and a grand jury dismissed charges. She soon got a booking to strip in Las Vegas, and, in 1957, played a comedy role in a legitimate theater in Dallas.         Later that year she was arrested for possession of marijuana in a case that drew wide attention because of Texas's tough new drug laws and questions about the legality of wiretapping by the Dallas police. During her appeal, she made $2,000 a week stripping in Las Vegas and Los Angeles to music specially composed for her. Around this time, she dated Mickey Cohen, an infamous mobster in the West.         After the Texas Supreme Court upheld her conviction, she served three years of a 15-year sentence. She wrote a poetry book in prison and emerged in a somber black outfit, quoting Bible verses. Around 1970, she largely disappeared from public view, with the notable exception of a nude pictorial feature in Oui, done when she was 41.         ''Let the world find someone else to talk about,'' she said in an interview with Texas Monthly in 2001. ''I like being left alone.''         Ms. Barr is survived by a daughter and a sister.       
         Wendy Wasserstein, who spoke for a generation of smart, driven but sometimes unsatisfied women in a series of popular plays that included the long-running Pulitzer Prize winner ''The Heidi Chronicles,'' died yesterday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 55 and lived in New York.         The cause was complications of lymphoma, said Andr√© Bishop, the artistic director of Lincoln Center Theater.         Starting in 1977 with her breakthrough work, ''Uncommon Women and Others,'' Ms. Wasserstein's plays struck a profound chord with women struggling to reconcile a desire for romance and companionship, drummed into baby boomers by the seductive fantasies of Hollywood movies, with the need for intellectual independence and achievement separate from the personal sphere.         ''She was known for being a popular, funny playwright, but she was also a woman and a writer of deep conviction and political activism,'' Mr. Bishop said. ''In Wendy's plays women saw themselves portrayed in a way they hadn't been onstage before -- wittily, intelligently and seriously at the same time. We take that for granted now, but it was not the case 25 years ago. She was a real pioneer.''         The lights on Broadway are to be dimmed tonight in her honor.         Her heroines -- intelligent and successful but also riddled with self-doubt -- sought enduring love a little ambivalently, but they didn't always find it, and their hard-earned sense of self-worth was often shadowed by the frustrating knowledge that American women's lives continued to be measured by their success at capturing the right man. Ms. Wasserstein drew on her own experience as a smart, well-educated, funny Manhattanite who wasn't particularly lucky in romance to create heroines in a similar mold, women who embraced the essential tenets of the feminist movement but didn't have the stomach for stridency.         For Ms. Wasserstein, as for many of her characters and fans, humor was a necessary bulwark against the disappointments of life, and a useful release valve for anger at cultural and social inequities. Her work, which included three books of nonfiction and a forthcoming novel as well as about a dozen plays, had a significant influence on depictions of American women in the media landscape over the years: Heidi Holland, the steadily single, uncompromising heroine of ''The Heidi Chronicles,'' can be seen as the cultural progenitor of ''Sex and the City's'' Carrie Bradshaw. (Coincidentally, Sarah Jessica Parker, who starred in that HBO series, played a series of small roles in the original production of ''The Heidi Chronicles.'')         Ms. Wasserstein, who grew up in New York, recalled attending Broadway plays as a young woman and being struck by the absence of people like herself onstage: ''I remember going to them and thinking, I really like this, but where are the girls?'' she once said. Ms. Wasserstein would fill the stage with ''girls'' -- a term she used with a wink despite taking flak for it -- in a series of plays that pleased loyal audiences even when the critics did not always embrace them.         ''The Heidi Chronicles,'' her most celebrated and popular play, opened on Broadway in 1989 after receiving critical acclaim Off Broadway. It ran for 622 performances and collected the Tony and New York Drama Critics Circle awards for best play as well as the Pulitzer Prize. Joan Allen created the title role in the play, which toured nationally and was later filmed for television with Jamie Lee Curtis.         Reviewing the play in Newsday, Linda Winer called it ''a wonderful and important play.'' She continued, ''Smart, compassionate, witty, courageous, this one not only dares to ask the hard questions  but asks them with humor, exquisite clarity and great fullness of heart.''         Ranging across more than two decades, ''The Heidi Chronicles'' was an episodic, seriocomic biography of an art historian seeking to establish a fixed and fulfilling sense of identity amid the social convolutions of the 1960's and 70's, a period when the rulebook on relationships between men and women was being rewritten. Heidi's allegiance to her ideals and her unwillingness to compromise them for the sake of winning a man's attentions caused conflict with friends who chose easier or different paths. Looking around at her materialistic, married, self-obsessed peers two decades after the exhilarating birth of feminism, Heidi observes: ''We're all concerned, intelligent, good women. It's just that I feel stranded. And I thought the whole point was that we wouldn't feel stranded. I thought the point was that we were all in this together.''         In the play's bittersweet final scene, Heidi has become a single mother to a new infant -- a path Ms. Wasserstein would herself pursue many years later, ultimately at great physical cost, when she gave birth, at age 48, to her daughter, Lucy Jane, in 1999.         Her next play, ''The Sisters Rosensweig,'' brought the issues of ethnicity and religion into her continuing conversation about the making and remaking of women's identities as it focused on three sisters with different relationships to their Jewish roots. It opened on Broadway in 1993, ran for 556 performances and was nominated for a Tony Award for best play. Less successful was her 1997 play, ''An American Daughter,'' inspired by the harsh attacks on women in politics, which lasted only 89 performances on Broadway, though Ms. Wasserstein later adapted it for television.         Ms. Wasserstein's other plays were produced Off Broadway, and included ''Isn't It Romantic'' (originally produced, to mixed notices, in 1981 and revised in 1983, when it was largely acclaimed) and ''Old Money'' (2000), a time-traveling comedy about the well heeled. Her most recent play, ''Third,'' about a female professor who is forced to question her staunchly held ideas about politics and ethics, opened in the fall at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater at Lincoln Center.         Ms. Wasserstein's abundant gift for comedy and her plays' popularity disguised the more serious ambitions underpinning her writing. ''My work is often thought of as lightweight commercial comedy,'' she told The Paris Review in 1997, ''and I have always thought, No, you don't understand: this is in fact a political act. 'The Sisters Rosensweig' had the largest advance in Broadway history,'' for a play (not a musical). Therefore, she continued, ''nobody is going to turn down a play on Broadway because a woman wrote it or because it's about women.'' When Ms. Wasserstein won the best-play Tony for ''Heidi Chronicles,'' it was the first time a woman had won the prize solo.         Ms. Wasserstein was born in Brooklyn on Oct. 18, 1950, the youngest of five siblings. Her father was a textile manufacturer, her mother an amateur dancer. In addition to her daughter, Ms. Wasserstein is survived by her mother, Lola Wasserstein; her brothers, Abner and Bruce, the chairman of the investment banking giant Lazard and the owner of New York magazine; and her sister Georgette Levis of Vermont. The family moved to Manhattan when Ms. Wasserstein was 12. After earning her undergraduate degree from Mount Holyoke College in 1971, she studied creative writing at City College with Joseph Heller and Israel Horovitz. Her first play, ''Any Woman Can't,'' found its way to Playwrights Horizons, then a small Off Broadway company, and was produced in 1973, shortly before she began to study playwriting in earnest at the Yale University School of Drama. (''My parents only let me go to drama school because it was Yale,'' she said in an interview for the magazine Bomb. ''They thought I'd marry a lawyer.'')         Ms. Wasserstein's career would be closely linked both with Playwrights Horizons, which under its artistic director, Mr. Bishop, would first produce ''The Heidi Chronicles,'' and with many of the artists she met at Yale, including the designer Heidi Ettinger and the director James Lapine, who remained lifelong friends. (Mr. Bishop left Playwrights Horizons to move to Lincoln Center Theater, which has produced all her subsequent plays.) Ms. Wasserstein's classmate, the playwright Christopher Durang, was a particular friend; she used his introductory icebreaker -- ''You look so bored, you must be very bright'' -- directly in ''The Heidi Chronicles,'' and they collaborated on a revue for the school's cabaret group.         After receiving a master's degree in fine arts in 1976, Ms. Wasserstein returned to Manhattan, and essentially never left. Her first major success came quickly, with ''Uncommon Women'' in 1977, produced by the Phoenix Theater. Depicting an informal reunion of a group of Mount Holyoke graduates that dissolves into scenes of their college days, it was described as ''funny, ironic and affectionate'' by Edith Oliver in The New Yorker, who added, ''Under the laughter there is  a feeling of bewilderment and disappointment over the world outside college, which promised so much, and with their own dreams, which seem to have stalled.'' The play, which was filmed and telecast on PBS's ''Great Performances,'' was also an important breakthrough in the careers of the actresses Glenn Close, Swoosie Kurtz and Meryl Streep, who played Ms. Close's role in the television version.         Ms. Wasserstein's other writing included a spoof of self-help literature, ''Sloth'' (Oxford University Press, 2005), and two books of essays, ''Bachelor Girls'' (Knopf, 1990) and ''Shiksa Goddess'' (Knopf, 2001), eclectic collections that embraced such disparate topics as Chekhov, her sister's battle with breast cancer, and the life and career of Mrs. Entenmann, creator of a bakery empire and fosterer of much guilt. Included in ''Shiksa Goddess'' was an essay Ms. Wasserstein wrote for The New Yorker, as poignant as it was hilarious, in which she discussed the medical complications of her late-life pregnancy and her newborn daughter's early struggles. ''Although I remain a religious skeptic,'' she wrote, referring to the disorienting days following Lucy Jane's premature birth, ''I had a kind of blind faith. I believed in the collaboration between the firm will of my one-pound-twelve-ounce daughter and the expertise of modern medicine. Of course, there was more than a bit of random luck involved, too.''         Lucy Jane will live with Ms. Wasserstein's brother Bruce.         Ms. Wasserstein also wrote a children's book, ''Pamela's First Musical,'' which she adapted for the stage in collaboration with Cy Coleman and David Zippel, and wrote the libretto for ''The Festival of Regrets,'' one of three one-act operas presented under the collective title ''Central Park'' at the New York City Opera. She had also completed a libretto for another opera with music by Deborah Drattell.         Ms. Wasserstein worked intermittently for Hollywood, although her sole produced screenplay credit was for ''The Object of My Affection,'' a 1998 romantic comedy that starred Jennifer Aniston. Her first novel, ''Elements of Style,'' is to be published by Knopf in April.         But the object of Ms. Wasserstein's deepest affection was always the stage, and her relationship with the theater permeated all aspects of her life. Her friendships in the theatrical community (and out of it) were wide and deep, and she generously gave of her time and resources to benefits of all kinds. A recipient of a Guggenheim Fellowship, she later served on the Guggenheim Foundation board, and she also taught playwriting at several universities.         In 1998, seeking to help instill her love for theater in a new generation of New Yorkers, she personally instigated a program to bring smart, underprivileged students from New York's public high schools to the theater. In an essay about the program for The New York Times, she wrote: ''As far as I'm concerned, every New Yorker is born with the inalienable right to ride the D train, shout 'Hey, lady!' with indignation and grow up going regularly to the theater. After all, if a city is fortunate enough to house an entire theater district, shouldn't access to the stage life within it be what makes coming of age in New York different from any other American city?''         The program, administered by the Theater Development Fund, has steadily expanded since Ms. Wasserstein first held a pizza party for eight students from DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx after a matinee of ''On the Town.'' Now officially called Open Doors, it consists of 17 groups (more than 100 students), chaperoned to a season's worth of theater offerings by interested mentors.         Of course Ms. Wasserstein's devotion to theater took its purest and most enduring form in her writing for the stage, which allowed her the freedom to explore the evolving lives of American women with a fluidity and frankness that befitted the complex experience she was writing about. Although it was always laced with comedy, her work was also imbued with an abiding sadness, a cleareyed understanding that independence can beget loneliness, that rigorous ideals and raised consciousnesses are not always good company at the dinner table. But she shared her compassion among a wide array of characters, those who settled and those who continued to search.         ''No matter how lonely you get or how many birth announcements you receive,'' a character says in ''Isn't It Romantic,'' ''the trick is not to get frightened. There's nothing wrong with being alone.'' The popularity of her work speaks for her ability to salve a little of that feeling of aloneness in her audiences with her deeply felt portraits of women -- and occasionally men -- seeking solidarity in their individuality, finding comfort in the knowledge that everybody else is sometimes uncomfortable with the choices they've made, too.       
         Birgit Nilsson, the Swedish soprano with a voice of impeccable trueness and impregnable stamina, died on Dec. 25 in Vastra Karup, the village where she was born, the Stockholm newspaper Svenska Dagbladet reported yesterday. She was 87.         A funeral was held yesterday at a church in her town, the presiding vicar, Fredrik Westerlund, told The Associated Press.         Ms. Nilsson made so strong an imprint on a number of roles that her name came to be identified with a repertory, the ''Nilsson repertory,'' and it was a broad one. She sang the operas of Richard Strauss and made a specialty of Puccini's ''Turandot,'' but it was Wagner who served her career and whom she served as no other soprano since the days of Kirsten Flagstad.         A big, blunt woman with a wicked sense of humor, Ms. Nilsson brooked no interference from Wagner's powerful and eventful orchestra writing. When she sang Isolde or Br√ºnnhilde, her voice pierced through and climbed above it. Her performances took on more pathos as the years went by, but one remembers her sound more for its muscularity, accuracy and sheer joy of singing under the most trying circumstances.         Her long career at the Bayreuth Festival and her immersion in Wagner in general, began in the mid-1950's. No dramatic soprano truly approached her stature thereafter, and in the roles of Isolde, Br√ºnnhilde and Sieglinde, she began her stately 30-year procession around the opera houses of the world. Her United States debut was in San Francisco in 1956. Three years later she made her debut at the Metropolitan Opera, singing Isolde under Karl B√∂hm, and some listeners treasure the memory of that performance as much as they do her live recording of the role from Bayreuth in 1966, also under B√∂hm. The exuberant review of her first Met performance appeared on the front page of The New York Times on Dec. 19, 1959, under the headline, ''Birgit Nilsson as Isolde Flashes Like New Star in 'Met' Heavens.''         Playing opposite Karl Liebl as Tristan, Howard Taubman wrote, ''she dominated the stage and the performance.''         When she appeared at the end of the first act to take a solo bow, he wrote, the audience ''roared like the Stadium fans when Conerly throws a winning touchdown pass.''         Like so many distinctive artists, Ms. Nilsson considered herself self-taught. ''The best teacher is the stage,'' she told an interviewer in 1981. ''You walk out onto it, and you have to learn to project.'' She deplored her early instruction and attributed her survival to native talent. ''My first voice teacher almost killed me,'' she said. ''The second was almost as bad.''         Birgit Nilsson was born in 1918. Her mother, evidently a talented singer, began Ms. Nilsson's musical education at 3, buying her a toy piano. She began picking out melodies on it.         She once told an interviewer that she could sing before she could walk. ''I even sang in my dreams,'' she added. A choirmaster near her home heard her sing and advised her to study. She entered the Royal Academy of Music in Stockholm in 1941.         Ms. Nilsson made her debut at the Royal Opera in Stockholm in 1946, replacing the scheduled Agathe in Weber's ''Freisch√ºtz,'' who was too ill to go on. The next year she claimed attention there as Verdi's Lady Macbeth under Fritz Busch. A wealth of parts followed, from Strauss and Verdi to Wagner, Puccini and Tchaikovsky.         Her first splash abroad was 1951, as Elettra in Mozart's ''Idomeneo'' at the Glyndebourne Festival in England. From there, it was a short hop to the Vienna State Opera and then to Bayreuth. She took the title role of ''Turandot,'' which is brief but in need of an unusually big sound, to Milan in 1958 and then to the rest of Italy.         Ms. Nilsson was suspicious of opera's recent youth culture and often remarked on the premature destruction of young voices brought on by overambitious career planning. ''Directors and managers don't care about their futures,'' she once said. ''They will just get another young person when this one goes bad.''         In today's opera culture, the best managed voices tend to mature in the singer's 40's and begin to deteriorate during the 50's. (Singers like Pl√°cido Domingo, flourishing in his 60's, might dispute such generalizations.) Yet at 66, when most singers hang onto whatever career remains through less taxing recitals with piano and discreet downward transpositions of key, Ms. Nilsson sang a New York concert performance of Strauss and Wagner that met both composers head-on.         ''Ms. Nilsson did not sound young,'' Will Crutchfield wrote in The Times. ''Soft and low notes were often precarious; sustained tones were not always steady.'' He continued: ''The wonderful thing is that she doesn't let this bother her. There was never a sense of distress or worry.''         The conductor Erich Leinsdorf thought that her longevity, like Flagstad's, had something to do with her Scandinavian heritage, remarking that Wagner required ''thoughtful, patient and methodical people.'' Ms. Nilsson attributed her long career to no particular lifestyle or regimen. ''I do nothing special,'' she once said. ''I don't smoke. I drink a little wine and beer. I was born with the right set of parents.''         In sheer power, Ms. Nilsson's high notes were sometimes compared to those of the Broadway belter Ethel Merman. One high C rendered in a ''Turandot'' performance in the outdoor Arena di Verona in Italy led citizenry beyond the walls to think that a fire alarm had been set off. Once urged to follow Ms. Nilsson in the same role at the Met, the eminent soprano Leonie Rysanek refused.         Ms. Nilsson was known for her one-liner humor. The secret to singing Isolde, she said, was ''comfortable shoes.'' After a disagreement with the Australian soprano Joan Sutherland, Ms. Nilsson was asked if she thought Ms. Sutherland's famous bouffant hairdo was real. She answered: ''I don't know. I haven't pulled it yet.'' After the tenor Franco Corelli was said to have bitten her neck in an onstage quarrel over held notes, Ms. Nilsson canceled performances complaining that she had rabies.         Ms. Nilsson was also a shrewd businesswoman and negotiated much of her own career. She never ranted or engaged in tantrums. She was also too proud to make outright demands. She would begin contract talks by refusing every offer and being evasive about her availability in general. This tack would continue until the impresario offered something she wanted. Ms. Nilsson's reply would be ''maybe.'' Now in control, she would be begged to accept what she desired in the first place.         She could stand up to intensely wired conductors like Georg Solti as well. When Solti, in ''Tristan und Isolde,'' insisted on tempos too slow for her taste, she made the first performance even slower, inducing a conductorial change of heart.         Partly because Ms. Nilsson was on the scene, Decca Records undertook the audacious and mammothly expensive project of making the first studio recording of Wagner's four-opera ''Ring'' cycle conducted by Solti and produced by John Culshaw. The effort took seven years, from 1958 to 1965. A film of the proceedings made her a familiar image for arts-conscious television viewers.         Ms. Nilsson's American career was derailed in the mid-70's by a squabble with the Internal Revenue Service, which had filed claims for back taxes. Several years later, cooler heads intervened: a schedule of payments was worked out, and Ms. Nilsson's ill-tempered hiatus from the United States ended. When she returned, Donal Henahan wrote in The Times, ''The famous shining trumpet of a voice is still far from sounding like a cornet.''         Ms. Nilsson appeared at the Met 223 times in 16 roles. She sang two complete ''Ring'' cycles in the 1961-62 season, and another in 1974-75. She was Isolde 33 times, and Turandot 52. The big soprano parts were all hers: Aida, Tosca, the Dyer's Wife in Strauss's ''Frau Ohne Schatten,'' Salome, Elektra, Lady Macbeth, Leonore in Beethoven's ''Fidelio,'' and both Venus and Elisabeth in Wagner's ''Tannh√§user.'' For much of this time, the Met's general manager was Rudolf Bing. Ms. Nilsson, when signing a contract, was asked to name a dependent. She wrote in Bing's name.         James Levine, who conducted her in Wagner and Strauss at the Met, said yesterday: ''Birgit was unique. Her voice, the dedication of her artistry, her wonderfully wicked sense of humor and her loyal friendship were in a class by themselves. I miss her already, as does the entire Met family.'' At Mr. Levine's 25th-anniversary gala at the Met in 1996, she spoke briefly and wittily, throwing in a brief and wholly professional Valkyrie hoot at the end.         Ms. Nilsson had by then retired to her childhood home in the Skane province of southern Sweden. Here her father had been a sixth-generation farmer, and here she had worked to grow beets and potatoes until she was 23. A decade ago an interviewer for The Times found her there: happy, serene and as unpretentious as ever. ''I've always tried to remember what my mother used to tell me,'' she said. ''Stay close to the earth. Then when you fall down, it won't hurt so much.''       
         Coretta Scott King, known first as the wife of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., then as his widow, then as an avid proselytizer for his vision of racial peace and nonviolent social change, died Monday at a hospital in Mexico. She was 78.         The primary cause of death was ''insufficient cardio-respiratory,'' which simply means her heart and breathing stopped, said Dr. Carlos Guerrero Tejada, who certified her death. The underlying causes were cerebral vascular disease and ovarian cancer, according to the death certificate.         Mrs. King died at Hospital Santa M√≥nica in Rosarito, Mexico, about 16 miles south of San Diego. She was admitted to the hospital last Thursday, said her sister, Edythe Scott Bagley. Mrs. Bagley said Mrs. King's body would be returned to her home, Atlanta, for entombment next to her husband, whose crypt is at the Martin Luther King Jr. Center there.         Mrs. King had been in failing health after a stroke and a heart attack last August. She appeared at a dinner honoring her husband on Jan. 14 but did not speak.         Andrew Young, a former United Nations ambassador and longtime family friend, said at a news conference yesterday morning that Mrs. King died in her sleep.         ''She was a woman born to struggle,'' Mr. Young said, ''and she has struggled and she has overcome.'' Mrs. King rose from rural poverty in Heiberger, Ala., and became an international symbol of the civil rights movement of the 1960's. She was an advocate for women's rights, the struggle against apartheid in South Africa, and other social and political issues.         In 1952, she was studying music at the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston when she met a young graduate student in philosophy, who, on their first date, told her: ''The four things that I look for in a wife are character, personality, intelligence and beauty. And you have them all.'' A year later she and Dr. King, then a young minister from a prominent Atlanta family, were married, beginning a remarkable partnership that ended with Dr. King's assassination in Memphis on April 4, 1968.         Mrs. King did not hesitate to pick up his mantle, marching before her husband was even buried at the head of the striking garbage workers he had gone to Memphis to champion. She went on to lead the effort for a national holiday in his honor and to found the Martin Luther King Jr. Center for Non-Violent Social Change in Atlanta, dedicated both to scholarship and to activism.         In addition to dealing with her husband's death, which left her with four young children, Mrs. King faced other trials and controversies. She was at times viewed as chilly and aloof by others in the civil rights movement. The King Center was criticized as competing for funds and siphoning energy from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which Dr. King had helped found. In recent years, the center had been widely viewed as adrift, characterized by squabbling within the family and a focus more on Dr. King's legacy than on continuing his work. Many allies were baffled and hurt by her campaign to exonerate James Earl Ray, who in 1969 pleaded guilty to her husband's murder, and her contention that Ray did not commit the crime.         More often, however, Mrs. King has been seen as an inspirational figure, a woman of enormous spiritual depth who came to personify the ideals Dr. King fought for.         ''She'll be remembered as a strong woman whose grace and dignity held up the image of her husband as a man of peace, of racial justice, of fairness,'' said the Rev. Joseph Lowery, who helped found the Southern Christian Leadership Conference with Dr. King and then served as its president for 20 years. ''I don't know that she was a civil rights leader in the truest sense, but she became a civil rights figure and a civil rights icon because of what she came to represent.''         Coretta Scott was born April 27, 1927, the second of three children born to Obadiah and Bernice Scott. She grew up in a two-room house that her father had built on land that had been owned by the family for three generations.         The family was poor, and she grew up picking cotton in the hot fields of the segregated South or doing housework. But Mr. Scott hauled timber, owned a country store and worked as a barber. His wife drove a school bus, and the whole family helped raise hogs, cows, chickens and vegetables. So, by the standards of blacks in Alabama at the time, the family had both resources and ambitions beyond the reach of most others.         Some of Coretta Scott's earliest insights into the injustice of segregation came as she walked to her one-room schoolhouse each day, watching buses of white children stir up dust as they passed. She got her first sense of the world beyond rural Alabama when she attended the Lincoln School, a private missionary institution in nearby Marion, where she studied piano and voice and had her first encounters with college-educated teachers, and where she resolved to flee to a world far beyond rural, segregated Alabama.         She graduated first in her high school class of 17 in 1945 and attended Antioch College in Yellow Springs, Ohio, where, two years earlier, her older sister, Edythe, had been the first black to enroll. She studied education and music, and went on to the New England Conservatory of Music, hoping to become a classical singer. She worked as a mail order clerk and cleaned houses to augment a fellowship that barely paid her tuition.         A First Encounter         Her first encounter with the man who would become her husband did not begin auspiciously, as recounted in ''Parting the Waters,'' by Taylor Branch. Dr. King, in the market for a wife, called her after getting her name from a friend and announced: ''You know every Napoleon has his Waterloo. I'm like Napoleon. I'm at my Waterloo, and I'm on my knees.''         Ms. Scott, two years his elder, replied: ''That's absurd. You don't even know me.''         Still, she agreed to meet for lunch the next day, only to be put off initially that he was not taller. But she was impressed by his erudition and confidence, and he saw in her the refined, intelligent woman he was looking for to be the wife of a preacher from one of Atlanta's most prominent ministerial families.         When he proposed, she deliberated for six months before saying yes, and they were married in the garden of her parents' house on June 18, 1953. The 350 guests, big-city folks from Atlanta and rural neighbors from Alabama, made it the biggest wedding, white or black, the area had ever seen.         Even before the wedding she made it clear she intended to remain her own woman. She stunned Dr. King's father, who presided over the wedding, by demanding that the promise to obey her husband be removed from the wedding vows. Reluctantly, he went along. After the wedding, the bridegroom fell asleep in the car while the new Mrs. King drove back to Atlanta.         Mrs. King thought she was signing on for the ministry, not ground zero in the seismic cultural struggle that would soon shake the South. Her husband became minister of the Dexter Avenue Baptist Church in Montgomery in 1954, but about a year later, the Montgomery Bus Boycott brought Dr. King to national attention. Then, like riders on a runaway freight train, the minister and his young wife found themselves in the middle of a movement that would transform the South and ripple through the nation.         In 1960, the family moved back to Atlanta, where Dr. King shared the pulpit of the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church with his father.         With four young children to raise -- Yolanda, born in 1955; Martin III, in 1957; Dexter, in 1961; and Bernice, in 1963 -- and a movement dominated by men, Mrs. King mostly remained away from the front lines of the movement. But the danger was always there, including a brush with death when Dr. King was stabbed while autographing books in Harlem in 1958.         An Active Role         What role Mrs. King would play was a source of some tension. Wanting to be there for their children, she also wanted to be active in the movement. Dr. King was, she had said, traditional in his view of women and balked at the notion that she should be more conspicuous.         ''Martin was a very strong person, and in many ways had very traditional ideas about women,'' she told The New York Times Magazine in 1972.         She added: ''He'd say, 'I have no choice, I have to do this, but you haven't been called.' And I said, 'Can't you understand? You know I have an urge to serve just like you have.' ''         Still, he always described her as a partner in his mission, not just a supportive spouse. ''I wish I could say, to satisfy my masculine ego, that I led her down this path,'' he said in a 1967 interview. ''But I must say we went down together, because she was as actively involved and concerned when we met as she is now.''         She largely carved out her own niche, most prominently through more than 30 Freedom Concerts, at which she lectured, read poetry and sang to raise awareness of and money for the civil rights movement.         The division disappeared with Dr. King's assassination. Suddenly, she was not just a symbol of the nation's grief, but a woman devoted to carrying on her husband's work. How to do that was something that evolved over time.         Marching in Memphis was a dramatic statement, but Ralph Abernathy, one of Dr. King's lieutenants, was chosen to take over.         In stepping in for her husband after his death, Mrs. King at first used his own words as much as possible, as if her goal were simply to maintain his presence. But soon she developed her own language and her own causes. So, when she stood in for her husband at the Poor People's Campaign at the Lincoln Memorial on June 19, 1968, she spoke not just of his vision, but of hers, of gender as well as race. She called upon American women ''to unite and form a solid block of women power to fight the three great evils of racism, poverty and war.''         She joined the board of directors of the National Organization for Women and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and she became widely identified with a broad array of international human rights issues, rather than focusing primarily on race.         That broad view, she would argue, was completely in keeping with Dr. King's vision. To carry on that legacy, she focused on two tasks. The first was to have a national holiday established in Dr. King's honor, and the second was to build the center in Atlanta to honor his memory, continue his work and provide a research facility for scholars of his work and the civil rights era.         The first goal was achieved, despite much opposition, in 1983, when Congress approved a measure designating the third Monday in January as a federal holiday in honor of Dr. King, who was born in Atlanta on Jan. 15, 1929. President Ronald Reagan, who had long opposed the King Holiday as too expensive and inappropriate, signed the bill, but pointedly refrained from criticizing fellow Republicans like Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina, who had opposed Dr. King, saying he had consorted with Communists.         The holiday was first observed on Jan. 20, 1986.         The second goal, much more expensive, time consuming and elusive, remains a work in progress -- and a troubled one at that. When Mrs. King announced plans for a memorial in 1969, she envisioned a Lincolnesque tomb, an exhibition hall, the restoration of her husband's childhood home, institutes on nonviolent social change and Afro-American studies, a library building, an archives building and a museum of African-American life and culture. She envisioned a center that would be a haven for scholars and a training ground for advocates of nonviolent social change.         An Ambitious Struggle         Even friends say it may have been too ambitious a goal. Building the center was a major achievement, but many of Dr. King's allies, particularly the leaders of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, said it was draining scarce resources.         The center also struggled to find its mission. Critics worried that it had become a family enterprise, Dexter and Martin III vying for leadership. The problems became particularly acute after Mrs. King suffered a stroke and heart attack in August 2005. The brothers struggled for control over the center while she was recuperating.         Many supporters were saddened and baffled by the family's campaign on behalf of Mr. Ray, who confessed to killing Dr. King and then recanted. Mr. Ray was seeking a new trial when he died in 1998.         After Mr. Ray's death, Mrs. King issued a statement calling his death a tragedy for his family and for the nation and saying that a trial would have ''produced new revelations about the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. as well as establish the facts concerning Mr. Ray's innocence.''         Besides her four children and her sister, Edythe, of Cheyney, Pa., survivors include her brother, Obie Leonard Scott of Greensboro, Ala.         Mrs. King remained a beloved figure, often compared to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis as a woman who overcame tragedy, held her family together and became an inspirational presence around the world.         Admirers said she bore her special burden -- being expected to carry on her husband's work and teachings -- with a sense of spirit and purpose that made her more than a symbol.         If picking up Dr. King's mantle was an impossible task, the relationship she shared with him was truly a partnership. ''I think on many points she educated me,'' Dr. King once said, and she never veered from the conviction, expressed throughout her life, that his dream was also hers.         ''I didn't learn my commitment from Martin,'' she told an interviewer. ''We just converged at a certain time.''         Correction:  February 17, 2006, Friday  An obituary of Coretta Scott King on Feb. 1 misstated the precedent set by her older sister, Edythe, at Antioch College, from which Mrs. King graduated. Her sister was the first to receive a scholarship under a program set up in 1945 to recruit minority students, not the first black to enroll.       
         Edna Lewis, the granddaughter of a former slave whose cookbooks revived the nearly forgotten genre of refined Southern cooking while offering a glimpse into African-American farm life in the early 20th century, died yesterday. She was 89.         Miss Lewis, as she was always called, died in her sleep in her home in Decatur, Ga., said Scott Peacock, her friend and caretaker. Mr. Peacock, a chef, had lived with Miss Lewis for more than six years, taking care of her as she grew frail.         Despite a quiet demeanor, Miss Lewis had a reach that extended from her family farm in Virginia, to left-wing politics in Manhattan to the birthplace of California cuisine.         Edna Lewis was born in a small settlement called Freetown in 1916, one of eight children. The farm had been granted to her grandfather, a freed slave. Growing, gathering and preparing food was more than just sustenance for the family; it was a form of entertainment. Without fancy cooking equipment, the family improvised, measuring baking powder on coins and cooking everything over wood.         In 1976, Miss Lewis turned the focused, close-to-nature cooking of her childhood into the first of her four books, ''The Taste of Country Cooking'' (Knopf). The book, considered a classic study of Southern cooking and one that sits on the shelves of America's best chefs, helped put an end to the knee-slapping, cornpone image of Southern food among many American cooks.         John T. Edge, the author and director of the Southern Foodways Alliance, said that because of her devotion to educating a nation about the nuances of Southern cooking, there was no question that the group's first lifetime achievement award, in 1999, would go to Miss Lewis.         He pointed to her recipe for shrimp and grits, a Southern classic. ''It's just butter and shrimp, but it requires great butter and great shrimp, and a puddle of that over stone-ground grits,'' he said. ''This pays homage to the frugal South, but it's also worthy of damask dinner cloth.''         Throughout her life, the politics of race and the swirl of New York drew Miss Lewis with a pull as strong as her Southern roots. She took a bus to New York when she was in her early 30's, eager for work but restricted by the racial attitudes of the times. An acquaintance found her a job in a laundry in Brooklyn, where she was assigned to an ironing board. She had never ironed and lasted three hours before a manager showed her to the door.         She sewed better than she ironed and was soon copying Dior dresses for Dorcas Avedon, then the wife of Richard Avedon. She made a dress for Marilyn Monroe, Mr. Peacock said, as well as the African-inspired dresses that became her signature.         In New York, she married Steve Kingston, a retired merchant seaman and a Communist. Shortly afterward, she became acquainted with John Nicholson, an antiques dealer who in 1949 decided to open a restaurant on the East Side of Manhattan. She became the cook, preparing cheese souffl√©s and roast chicken. Caf√© Nicholson became an instant success among fashionistas, bohemians and artists.         She remained at the restaurant until the late 1950's, during which she and her husband would argue over its bourgeois character.         ''He used to always say, 'This restaurant should be for ordinary people on the street. You're catering to capitalists,' '' Mr. Nicholson said in an interview with The New York Times in 2004. ''It was such a bore.'' Miss Lewis left Caf√© Nicolson in 1954, and the couple tried a number of ventures, including running a pheasant farm.         In the mid-1970's, while sidelined by a broken leg, Miss Lewis began writing a cookbook. With encouragement from Judith Jones, the cookbook editor at Knopf who also edited Julia Childs, Miss Lewis turned her handwritten pages into ''The Taste of Country Cooking.'' In 1979, Craig Claiborne of The Times said the book ''may well be the most entertaining regional cookbook in America.''         In a 1989 interview with The Times, Miss Lewis said: ''As a child in Virginia, I thought all food tasted delicious. After growing up, I didn't think food tasted the same, so it has been my lifelong effort to try and recapture those good flavors of the past.''         That dedication to purity of ingredients, taste and authenticity endeared her to Alice Waters and many other chefs. Ms. Waters, whose restaurant, Chez Panisse, in Berkeley defined California cuisine in the 1980's, said Miss Lewis was uncompromising but subtle in her approach to food and politics alike.         ''She just had a very quiet way of speaking, and it really engaged you because she was so soft-spoken; you have to listen carefully,'' Ms. Waters said. ''There was a kind of intimacy that you immediately had.''         Ms. Jones, who edited three books by Miss Lewis, recalled her yesterday as a lover of Jack Daniel's, Bessie Smith and understated conversation. ''She had a tremendous sense of dignity in the face of often difficult treatment,'' Ms. Jones said.         After ''The Taste of Country Cooking'' raised her profile, Miss Lewis returned to restaurants, most notably to Gage & Tollner in Brooklyn. She remained there for almost 20 years, retiring in 1995. Her husband had died as she completed her first book, Ms. Jones said.         Along with friends, she founded the Society for the Revival and Preservation of Southern Food, dedicated in part to seeing that people did not forget how to cook with lard.         One member of the group was Mr. Peacock, whom Miss Lewis met in 1990 while he was cooking at the Georgia governor's mansion. The two developed a deep friendship, collaborating on the book ''The Gift of Southern Cooking'' (Knopf) and teaching cooking classes. Their long association -- between a young, white, gay Southern chef and a widowed African-American doyenne -- earned them the nickname The Odd Couple of Southern Cooking.         As Miss Lewis aged, Mr. Peacock became her caretaker, causing a split with her surviving brothers and sisters, who waged an unsuccessful legal battle to move her to the family home in Unionville, Va., a town about 70 miles southwest of Washington.         Miss Lewis's dispute with her siblings became well known in the food world, most of whose members supported her and Mr. Peacock, seeing him as an eager student to a master of Southern cooking.         ''One of the biggest goals they had was that they didn't want to lose the classic Southern dishes, and this was the binding factor,'' Marion Cunningham, the grande dame of home cooking, said in an interview with The Times in 2004. ''They preached about it, and they wanted to let the country know what the South stood for.''         One sister, Ruth Lewis Smith, and a brother, George Lewis, both of Unionville, survive Miss Lewis, as does a stepsister, Bessie Jones of Philadelphia. She is also survived by Dr. Afeworki Paulos, a lecturer at the University of Michigan, whom she adopted as a young adult in 1986 shortly after he had arrived from Eritrea to study in the United States.         Dr. Paulos said his mother possessed a clear-headed sense of equality and fairness. ''I always say, yeah, the cooking is there,'' he said yesterday, ''but the way I remember her is as a woman who was very deeply involved in social issues.''         Mr. Peacock plans to hold a private memorial service for Miss Lewis in the Atlanta area. She will be buried in a family plot in Unionville.         Correction:  February 16, 2006, Thursday  An obituary on Tuesday about Edna Lewis, the chef and author who wrote about refined Southern cuisine, misstated the order of her cookbooks. Her most famous one, ''The Taste of Country Cooking'' (Knopf, 1976), was her second, not her first. ''The Edna Lewis Cookbook'' (Bobbs-Merrill, 1972) was her first.         Because of an editing error, the obituary misstated Miss Lewis's tenure as chef at Gage & Tollner in Brooklyn. It was 5 years, not 20. In some copies, also because of an editing error, the obituary misstated the surname of the cookbook author who, like Miss Lewis, had been edited by Judith Jones at Knopf. She was Julia Child, not Childs.       
         Peggy Appiah, who as a daughter of a British chancellor of the exchequer defied the conventions of her time by marrying an Ashanti political leader and who went on to become an author and a revered figure in her adopted homeland, Ghana, died Saturday in Kumasi, Ghana. She was 84.         The cause was a heart attack at Akomfo Anokye Hospital, according to her son, the philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah.         Reared in upper-crust Britain, the youngest of four children of Sir Stafford Cripps, a Labor party leader and cabinet officer in the Clement Attlee government (1945-51), Peggy Cripps caused an international sensation when she announced plans to marry in July 1953. Her fianc√© was Joseph Emmanuel Appiah, who was in London as a law student and representative of Kwame Nkrumah, prime minister of the Gold Coast, the British colony that became Ghana in 1957.         Nkrumah was Ghana's first president, and Mr. Appiah was a close associate and his choice for vice president, until political differences led Nkrumah to imprison him several times.         The Appiahs are said to have been the inspiration, along with another African-British couple, Seretse Khama and Ruth Williams, for the 1967 film ''Guess Who's Coming to Dinner,'' which dealt with a California couple's reaction to their daughter's engagement to a black doctor.         That view was lent support by Henry Louis Gates Jr., chairman of the department of African and African-American studies at Harvard, and a friend of Mr. Appiah's since their student days, who noted that it was a marriage of equals at the highest levels of their societies.         ''She was to the manner born and he was an aristocrat related to the king of the Ashanti,'' Mr. Gates said in a telephone interview on Tuesday. ''He was the John Adams of his country; its founding father with Kwame Nkrumah.''         The couple met at a gathering of the West African Students Union, of which Mr. Appiah was president. From the start, Miss Cripps made it clear that she would not be intimidated by the firestorm of criticism the couple endured.         ''If we experience any difficulties in mixing with Europeans, I shall throw in my lot with the colored people,'' she told The Sunday Express of London.         The marriage came to symbolize far more than the union of two individuals. Richard Weight, a British historian who is making a documentary about interracial marriage, said: ''For a lot of people, it drew the line between those who thought Britain had an integrated postcolonial future and those who didn't. And it became an international story with particular resonance because it involved the daughter of a former chancellor.''         Born in 1921, Enid Margaret Cripps, who used the name Peggy, was the youngest of four children of Sir Stafford and Lady Isobel Swithenbank Cripps. On her father's side she could trace her lineage back to William the Conqueror. She was reared at a rambling country house, Goodfellows, and spent much of World War II in Moscow, where her father served as ambassador. After the war, she went to Iran, where she worked for the British Army, which ran the railways.         She is survived by her son, the Laurance Rockefeller professor of philosophy at Princeton, who lives in Manhattan and Princeton, N.J., and three daughters, Isabel Endresen, an economist, of Windhoek, Namibia, Adwo Edun, a landscape gardener, of Lagos, Nigeria, and Abena Appiah of Kumasi; and eight grandchildren. Settling in Kumasi, the capital of the Ashanti people, shortly after her wedding, she shunned the traditional British -- and Ghanaian-- role of homemaker, even as she reared her children, served as helpmate to her husband, kept the family going when he was in prison and established several philanthropies.         ''At one time there was an effort to deport her,'' said Henry Finder, editorial director of The New Yorker, who is Professor Appiah's companion. ''She said the airport was a long way away and she would kick and scream every inch of the way. Fearful of the publicity that would engender, they backed down.''         Known to many in Ghana as Auntie Peggy, Mrs. Appiah was a prolific writer of children's books, many of them based on the Ghanaian folk tales her husband told their children, as well as of novels, poetry and most recently a collection of 7,000 Ashanti proverbs, on which she collaborated with her son.         The book, published in English and Ashanti, had its origins in her collection of gold weights.         ''She collected weights used for weighing gold but made of brass,'' Professor Appiah said. ''Many of them had figurative art that came from proverbs. When a dealer came to the house, she would ask, 'What is the proverb?' and if he didn't know, she would eventually travel to the village to find out.''         Though she had a house in Brighton, England, Mrs. Appiah considered Ghana her home.         ''When my father died 15 years ago, people asked her, 'When are you going home?' '' her son said. ''She kept saying, 'I am home.' Finally she bought herself a plot of ground to be buried in, so when people said, 'When are you going home?,' she could answer: 'I am not going home. I have my burial plot here.' ''       
         Moira Shearer, a luminous star in the galaxy of British ballerinas who brought the Royal Ballet to international attention and whose dramatic portrayal as the doomed heroine of the 1948 film ''The Red Shoes'' was searingly impressed on generations of moviegoers, died in Oxford, England, on Tuesday. She was 80.         Her death was announced by her husband, the writer and broadcaster Ludovic Kennedy. He said Ms. Shearer had been weak since her birthday last month and died in John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, The Associated Press reported.         ''The Red Shoes,'' often called the most popular film about ballet, threatened to overshadow Ms. Shearer's reputation as a classical dancer. A Scottish beauty with flaming red hair, she created a sensation with her performance as a London debutante who aspires to be a ballerina but is driven to suicide by leaping in front of a train in Monte Carlo.         As Ms. Shearer said in later years, ''The Red Shoes'' was very different from the world of ballet that she knew. The image created by the film's directors, Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger, was of a Russian √©migr√© ballet troupe filled with clashing temperaments. Dominated by a tyrannical impresario inspired in part by Serge Diaghilev, the troupe's backstage life had the ring of overwrought truth. But unlike the film's heroine, Victoria Page, Ms. Shearer did not face a seemingly impossible choice between a career and a marriage. During her dancing career, she acted in films and on the stage. In later years, she wrote two books, including ''Balletmaster: A Dancer's View of George Balanchine'' (1986), and wrote a column for The Daily Telegraph.         She also had four children, who, with her husband, survive her. They include a son, Alastair, and three daughters, Ailsa, Rachel and Fiona.         The recently established British ballet groups that Ms. Shearer joined in the 1940's were identified with hard work and struggle, devoid of the surface glamour of the √©migr√© companies that succeeded Diaghilev's Ballets Russes. After dancing with Mona Inglesby's Ballet International in 1941, Ms. Shearer joined Sadler's Wells Ballet, which changed its name to the Royal Ballet in 1956. Rising from the ranks to ballerina from 1942 to 1952, Ms. Shearer was identified both with leading roles in the 19th-century classics and works created by the great British choreographer Frederick Ashton. She danced the title role in the premiere of his ''Cinderella'' in 1948 and along with Margot Fonteyn and Pamela May, led his seminal neoclassical ballet ''Symphonic Variations'' in 1946.         Ms. Shearer, however, was never considered the reigning ballerina in Sadler's Wells. That position was clearly held by Ms. Fonteyn, who was promoted from the start by Ninette de Valois, the company's founder. At least two generations of stellar dancers, including Ms. May, Ms. Shearer, Beryl Grey, Violetta Elvin and Nadia Nerina all shared roles with Ms. Fonteyn but not her status in the company.         Born Moira Shearer King on Jan. 17, 1926, in Dumferline, Scotland, she trained with the Russian teacher Nicholas Legat and at the Sadler's Wells School. Ashton brought her to the public's attention with a major role as Pride in his ballet ''The Quest'' in 1943. She was reluctant to appear in ''The Red Shoes'' but did so at de Valois's prodding. When the Sadler's Wells Ballet made its sensational United States debut at the Metropolitan Opera House in September 1949, ticket buyers knew Ms. Shearer from ''The Red Shoes'' and thought she would be seen in ''The Sleeping Beauty'' on opening night. De Valois, however, cast her in the fourth act in the ''Bluebird'' pas de deux.         Shortly afterward (1950) she appeared in a film version of ''The Tales of Hoffmann,'' making several other films later with and without dancing. She also appeared as a guest artist with Sadler's Wells and with Roland Petit's company. In 1954, she toured the United States as Titania in the Old Vic stage production of ''A Midsummer's Night's Dream.'' Among her other films were ''Peeping Tom,'' ''The Man Who Loved Redheads,'' ''The Story of Three Loves'' and ''Black Tights.''         Multitalented, she was seen by John Martin of The New York Times in Ashton's ''Wedding Bouquet'' in 1949 as exhibiting ''her roguish gift for comedy in a brilliant performance.''         Correction:  March 23, 2006, Thursday  An obituary on Feb. 2 about the ballerina and movie actress Moira Shearer misspelled the name of the city where she was born. As a reader pointed out to The Times this week, it is Dunfermline, Scotland, not Dumferline.       
         Betty Friedan, the feminist crusader and author whose searing first book, ''The Feminine Mystique,'' ignited the contemporary women's movement in 1963 and as a result permanently transformed the social fabric of the United States and countries around the world, died Saturday, her 85th birthday, at her home in Washington.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said Emily Bazelon, a family spokeswoman.         With its impassioned yet clear-eyed analysis of the issues that affected women's lives in the decades after World War II -- including enforced domesticity, limited career prospects and, as chronicled in later editions, the campaign for legalized abortion -- ''The Feminine Mystique'' is widely regarded as one of the most influential nonfiction books of the 20th century. Published by W. W. Norton & Company, the book had sold more than three million copies by the year 2000 and has been translated into many languages.         ''The Feminine Mystique'' made Ms. Friedan world famous. It also made her one of the chief architects of the women's liberation movement of the late 1960's and afterward, a sweeping social upheaval that harked back to the suffrage campaigns of the turn of the century and would be called feminism's second wave.         In 1966, Ms. Friedan helped found the National Organization for Women, serving as its first president. In 1969, she was a founder of the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws, now known as Naral Pro-Choice America. With Gloria Steinem, Bella Abzug and others, she founded the National Women's Political Caucus in 1971.         Though in later years, some feminists dismissed Ms. Friedan's work as outmoded, a great many aspects of modern life that seem routine today -- from unisex Help Wanted ads to women in politics, medicine, the clergy and the military -- are the direct result of the hard-won advances she helped women attain.         For decades a familiar presence on television and the lecture circuit, Ms. Friedan, with her short stature and deeply hooded eyes, looked for much of her adult life like a ''combination of Hermione Gingold and Bette Davis,'' as Judy Klemesrud wrote in The New York Times Magazine in 1970.         A brilliant student who graduated summa cum laude from Smith College in 1942, Ms. Friedan trained as a psychologist but never pursued a career in the field. When she wrote ''The Feminine Mystique,'' she was a suburban housewife and mother who supplemented her husband's income by writing freelance articles for women's magazines.         Though Ms. Friedan was not generally considered a lyrical stylist, ''The Feminine Mystique,'' read today, is as mesmerizing as it was more than four decades ago:         ''Gradually, without seeing it clearly for quite a while, I came to realize that something is very wrong with the way American women are trying to live their lives today,'' Ms. Friedan wrote in the opening line of the preface. ''I sensed it first as a question mark in my own life, as a wife and mother of three small children, half-guiltily, and therefore half-heartedly, almost in spite of myself, using my abilities and education in work that took me away from home.''         The words have the hypnotic pull of a fairy tale, and for the next 400 pages, Ms. Friedan identifies, dissects and damningly indicts one of the most pervasive folk beliefs of postwar American life: the myth of suburban women's domestic fulfillment she came to call the feminine mystique.         Drawing on history, psychology, sociology and economics, as well as on interviews she conducted with women across the country, Ms. Friedan charted a gradual metamorphosis of the American woman from the independent, career-minded New Woman of the 1920's and 30's into the vacant, aproned housewife of the postwar years.         The portrait she painted was chilling. For a typical woman of the 1950's, even a college-educated one, life centered almost exclusively on chores and children. She cooked and baked and bandaged and chauffeured and laundered and sewed. She did the mopping and the marketing and took her husband's gray flannel suit to the cleaners. She was happy to keep his dinner warm till he came wearily home from downtown.         The life she led, if educators, psychologists and the mass media were to be believed, was the fulfillment of every women's most ardent dream. Yet she was unaccountably tired, impatient with the children, craving something that neither marital sex nor extramarital affairs could satisfy. Her thoughts sometimes turned to suicide. She consulted a spate of doctors and psychiatrists, who prescribed charity work, bowling and bridge. If those failed, there were always tranquilizers to get her through her busy day.         A Nebraska housewife with a Ph.D. in anthropology whom Ms. Friedan interviewed told her:         ''A film made of any typical morning in my house would look like an old Marx Brothers comedy. I wash the dishes, rush the older children off to school, dash out in the yard to cultivate the chrysanthemums, run back in to make a phone call about a committee meeting, help the youngest child build a blockhouse, spend fifteen minutes skimming the newspapers so I can be well-informed, then scamper down to the washing machines where my thrice-weekly laundry includes enough clothes to keep a primitive village going for an entire year. By noon I'm ready for a padded cell. Very little of what I've done has been really necessary or important. Outside pressures lash me though the day. Yet I look upon myself as one of the more relaxed housewives in the neighborhood.''         ''The Feminine Mystique'' began as a survey Ms. Friedan conducted in 1957 for the 15th reunion of her graduating class at Smith. It was intended to refute a prevailing postwar myth: that higher education kept women from adapting to their roles as wives and mothers. Judging from her own capable life, Ms. Friedan expected her classmates to describe theirs as similarly well adjusted. But what she discovered in the women's responses was something far more complex, and more troubling -- a ''nameless, aching dissatisfaction'' that she would famously call ''the problem that has no name.''         When Ms. Friedan sent the same questionnaire to graduates of Radcliffe and other colleges, and later interviewed scores of women personally, the results were the same. The women's answers gave her the seeds of her book. They also forced her to confront the painful limitations of her own suburban idyll.         Bettye Naomi Goldstein was born on Feb. 4, 1921, in Peoria, Ill. Her father, Harry, was an immigrant from Russia who parlayed a street-corner collar-button business into a prosperous downtown jewelry store. Her gifted, imperious mother, Miriam, had been the editor of the women's page of the local newspaper before giving up her job for marriage and children. Only years later, when she was writing ''The Feminine Mystique,'' did Ms. Friedan come to see her mother's cold, critical demeanor as masking a deep bitterness at giving up the work she loved.         Growing up brainy, Jewish, outspoken and, by the standards of the time, unlovely, Bettye was ostracized. She was barred from the fashionable sororities at her Peoria high school and rarely asked on dates. It was an experience, she would later say, that made her identify with people on the margins of society.         At Smith, she blossomed. For the first time, she could be as smart as she wanted, as impassioned as she wanted and as loud as she wanted, and for four happy years she was all those things. Betty received her bachelor's degree in 1942 -- by that time she had dropped the final ''e,'' which she considered an affectation of her mother's -- and accepted a fellowship to the University of California, Berkeley, for graduate work in psychology.         At Berkeley, she studied with the renowned psychologist Erik Erikson, among others. She won a second fellowship, even more prestigious than the first, that would allow her to continue for a doctorate. But she was dating a young physicist who felt threatened by her success. He pressed her to turn down the fellowship, and she did, an experience she would later recount frequently in interviews. She also turned down the physicist, returning home to Peoria before moving to Greenwich Village in New York.         There, Ms. Friedan worked as an editor at The Federated Press, a small news service that provided stories to labor newspapers nationwide. In 1946, she took a job as a reporter with U. E. News, the weekly publication of the United Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers of America.         In 1947, she married Carl Friedan, a theater director who later became an advertising executive. They started a family and moved to a rambling Victorian house in suburban Rockland County, N.Y.         Ms. Friedan, whose marriage would end in divorce in 1969, is survived by their three children, Daniel Friedan of Princeton, N.J.; Emily Friedan of Buffalo; and Jonathan Friedan of Philadelphia; a brother, Harry Goldstein, of Palm Springs, Calif., and Purchase, N.Y.; a sister, Amy Adams, of New York City; and nine grandchildren.         ''The Feminine Mystique'' had the misfortune to appear during a newspaper printers' strike. The reviews that appeared afterward ran the gamut from bewildered to outraged to cautiously laudatory. Some critics also felt that Ms. Friedan had insufficiently acknowledged her debt to Simone de Beauvoir, whose 1949 book, ''The Second Sex,'' dealt with many of the same issues.         Writing in The New York Times Book Review in April 1963, Lucy Freeman called ''The Feminine Mystique'' a ''highly readable, provocative book,'' but went on to question its basic premise, writing, of Ms. Friedan:         ''Sweeping generalities, in which this book necessarily abounds, may hold a certain amount of truth but often obscure the deeper issues. It is superficial to blame the 'culture' and its handmaidens, the women's magazines, as she does. What is to stop a woman who is interested in national and international affairs from reading magazines that deal with those subjects? To paraphrase a famous line, 'The fault, dear Mrs. Friedan, is not in our culture, but in ourselves.' ''         Among readers, however, the response to the book was so overwhelming that Ms. Friedan realized she needed more than words to address the condition of women's lives. After moving back to Manhattan with her family, she determined to start a progressive organization that would be the equivalent, as she often said, of an N.A.A.C.P. for women.         In 1966, Ms. Friedan and a group of colleagues founded the National Organization for Women. She was its president until 1970.         One of NOW's most visible public actions was the Women's Strike for Equality, held on Aug. 26, 1970, in New York and in cities around the country. In New York, tens of thousands of woman marched down Fifth Avenue, with Ms. Friedan in the lead. (Before the march, she made a point of lunching at Whyte's, a downtown restaurant formerly open to men only.)         Carrying signs and banners (''Don't Cook Dinner -- Starve a Rat Tonight!'' ''Don't Iron While the Strike Is Hot''), women of all ages, along with a number of sympathetic men, marched joyfully down the street to cheering crowds. The march ended with a rally in Bryant Park, behind the New York Public Library, with passionate speeches by Ms. Friedan, Ms. Steinem, Ms. Abzug and Kate Millett.         Not all of Ms. Friedan's ventures were as successful. The First Women's Bank and Trust Company, which she helped found in 1973, is no longer in business. Nor were even her indomitable presence and relentless energy enough to secure passage of the Equal Rights Amendment.         Though widely respected as a modern-day heroine, Ms. Friedan was by no means universally beloved, even -- or perhaps especially -- by members of the women's movement. She was famously abrasive. She could be thin-skinned and imperious, subject to screaming fits of temperament.         In the 1970's and afterward, some feminists criticized Ms. Friedan for focusing almost exclusively on the concerns of middle-class married white women and ignoring those of minorities, lesbians and the poor. Some called her retrograde for insisting that women could, and should, live in collaborative partnership with men.         Ms. Friedan's private life was also famously stormy. In her recent memoir, ''Life So Far'' (Simon & Schuster, 2000), she accused her husband of being physically abusive during their marriage, writing that he sometimes gave her black eyes, which she concealed with make-up at public events and on television.         Mr. Friedan, who died in December, repeatedly denied the accusations. In an interview with Time magazine in 2000, shortly after the memoir's publication, he called Ms. Friedan's account a ''complete fabrication.'' He added: ''I am the innocent victim of a drive-by shooting by a reckless driver savagely aiming at the whole male gender.''         Ms. Friedan's other books include ''It Changed My Life: Writings on the Women's Movement'' (Random House, 1976); ''The Second Stage'' (Summit, 1981); and ''The Fountain of Age'' (Simon & Schuster, 1993).         The recipient of many awards and honorary degrees, she was a visiting professor at universities around the country, among them Columbia, Temple and the University of Southern California. In recent years, Ms. Friedan was associated with the Institute for Women and Work at Cornell University.         Despite all of her later achievements, Ms. Friedan would be forever known as the suburban housewife who started a revolution with ''The Feminine Mystique.'' Rarely has a single book been responsible for such sweeping, tumultuous and continuing social transformation.         The new society Ms. Friedan proposed, founded on the notion that men and women were created equal, represented such a drastic upending of the prevailing social norms that over the years to come, she would be forced to explain her position again and again.         ''Some people think I'm saying, 'Women of the world unite -- you have nothing to lose but your men,' '' she told Life magazine in 1963. ''It's not true. You have nothing to lose but your vacuum cleaners.''         'The Problem That Has No Name'         Following is an excerpt from ''The Feminine Mystique,'' by Betty Friedan.         The problem lay buried, unspoken, for many years in the minds of American women. It was a strange stirring, a sense of dissatisfaction, a yearning that women suffered in the middle of the twentieth century in the United States. Each suburban wife struggled with it alone. As she made the beds, shopped for groceries, matched slipcover material, ate peanut butter sandwiches with her children, chauffeured Cub Scouts and Brownies, lay beside her husband at night -- she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question -- ''Is this all?''         For over fifteen years there was no word of this yearning in the millions of words written about women, for women, in all the columns, books and articles by experts telling women their role was to seek fulfillment as wives and mothers. Over and over women heard in voices of tradition and of Freudian sophistication that they could desire no greater destiny than to glory in their own femininity. Experts told them how to catch a man and keep him, how to breastfeed children and handle their toilet training, how to cope with sibling rivalry and adolescent rebellion; how to buy a dishwasher, bake bread, cook gourmet snails, and build a swimming pool with their own hands; how to dress, look, and act more feminineand make marriage more exciting; how to keep their husbands from dying young and their sons from growing into delinquents.         In the fifteen years after World War II, this mystique of feminine fulfillment became the cherished and self-perpetuating core of contemporary American culture. Millions of women lived their lives in the image of those pretty pictures of the American suburban housewife, kissing their husbands goodbye in front of the picture window, depositing their stationwagonsful of children at school, and smiling as they ran the new electric waxer over the spotless kitchen floor. They baked their own bread, sewed their own and their children's clothes, kept their new washing machines and dryers running all day. They changed the sheets on the beds twice a week instead of once, took the rug-hooking class in adult education, and pitied their poor frustrated mothers, who had dreamed of having a career. Their only dream was to be perfect wives and mothers; their highest ambition to have five children and a beautiful house, their only fight to get and keep their husbands. They had no thought for the unfeminine problems of the world outside the home; they wanted the men to make the major decisions. They gloried in their role as women, and wrote proudly on the census blank: ''Occupation: housewife.''         Reprinted from yesterday's late editions.         Correction:  February 8, 2006, Wednesday  An obituary on Monday and in some copies on Sunday about Betty Friedan, the pioneering feminist who wrote ''The Feminine Mystique,'' misstated the residence of her sister, Amy Adams. It is Chapel Hill, N.C., not New York City.       
         Sarah Caldwell, one of America's best known and most adventurous conductors and opera directors and the founding director of the Opera Company of Boston, died Thursday at the Maine Medical Center in Portland. She was 82.         She died of heart failure, said James Morgan, a former manager of the Boston company and a close associate.         Ms. Caldwell, who was also the first woman to conduct at the Metropolitan Opera, lived in Freeport, Me.         In 1990, 32 years after its founding, facing debt and disarray, the Opera Company of Boston went out of business. But in its glory years, Ms. Caldwell's company was a model of bold, imaginative programming, offering musically insightful productions with distinguished casts.         ''Some of the most creative work that many of us artists have done has been with Sarah,'' Beverly Sills, the soprano and former chairwoman of the Metropolitan Opera, said yesterday. ''Some of the most aggravating, as well. She had a million different ways to do one thing and was never satisfied until she had tried them all.''         Ms. Caldwell often took on difficult 20th-century operas that bigger companies shirked. Her productions included the American premieres of Prokofiev's ''War and Peace,'' Schoenberg's ''Moses und Aron,'' Roger Sessions's ''Montezuma,'' Peter Maxwell Davies's ''Taverner'' and Rodion Shchedrin's ''Dead Souls,'' as well as the world premieres of Gunther Schuller's ''Fisherman and His Wife'' and Robert Di Domenica's ''Balcony.''         Her company seldom presented more than four productions a season. But from the start, Ms. Caldwell attracted world-class artists, notably Ms. Sills and Dame Joan Sutherland. She was both director and conductor for most of her productions -- a double role that often imbued them with a strong vision. But her split duties just as often seemed to divide her attention, resulting in weakened execution onstage and in the orchestra pit.         Ms. Caldwell's longest period of success came in the 1970's, when the company was thriving and her visibility as a conductor was growing. In 1974, she became only the second woman to conduct the New York Philharmonic. (Nadia Boulanger had been the first in 1939 and again in 1962.) For the program, partly sponsored by Ms. magazine, Ms. Caldwell offered only works by women, among them Ruth Crawford Seeger, Lili Boulanger and Thea Musgrave.         A Time magazine cover story on Nov. 10, 1975, called her ''Music's Wonder Woman.'' Two months later, on Jan. 13, 1976, she became the first woman to conduct at the Met. The opera was ''La Traviata,'' starring Ms. Sills, who had cajoled the company into engaging Ms. Caldwell. She conducted 11 total performances.         As a company director, Ms. Caldwell was notoriously disorganized and loath to delegate authority. Only 5 feet 3 inches tall and, for most of her life, overweight, she was an indomitable but chaotic force. Rehearsal periods were typically fraught with crisis. Ms. Caldwell, sleepless and disheveled, would keep stage crews working all night and fight off creditors all day. Stories abounded of staff members' finding their boss napping in a stairwell or atop a pile of costumes backstage.         Yet, even on a shoestring budget, she managed to present challenging repertory in inventive productions. One, in 1965, was Rossini's ''Semiramide,'' a rarely performed work at the time, with Dame Joan and Marilyn Horne. Ms. Caldwell also staged the United States premiere of ''Boris Godunov'' with Mussorgsky's original orchestration nine years before the Metropolitan Opera did. And hers was the first complete American staging of Berlioz's ''Troyens.''         Ms. Caldwell faced formidable obstacles in running her company. Financial support from the Boston civic and cultural worlds was inconsistent, and the company lacked an adequate theater. The year her company began, 1958, the long-neglected 50-year-old Boston Opera House was torn down, and the new company was forced into a nomadic existence, performing at the Donnelly Theater (razed in 1968), then the downtown Shubert Theater and then a series of unlikely places, like a university gym and a South End cyclorama.         The company finally settled at the Orpheum Theater, staying for five years. But the stage was only 26 feet deep, and there was no orchestra pit. Ms. Caldwell's solution was to remove several rows of seats from the orchestra section to make room for her players. She conducted sitting in a director's chair, usually in slippers.         In 1978, the company bought the B. F. Keith Memorial Theater on Washington Street in downtown Boston, and it finally had a home -- a run-down but potentially excellent 2,500-seat theater with good acoustics and palatial lobbies. But the stage was just 35 feet deep, and the only way to expand would have been to claim a small street that bordered the back of the building, an idea that neighborhood residents and businesses opposed. A complete renovation would have cost only $13 million, Ms. Caldwell estimated. But by 1990, with back taxes looming, she sold the theater to a Texas developer, and her company essentially ceased to exist.         Sarah Caldwell was born on March 6, 1924, in Maryville, Mo. Her parents divorced when she was an infant. During her childhood, she and her brother frequently lived with relatives while her mother, Margaret, was off pursuing graduate studies in music. Ms. Caldwell began taking violin lessons early, and by 6 was giving concerts out of state. When her mother married Henry Alexander, a political scientist at the University of Arkansas, the family moved to Fayetteville.         Discouraged by her stepfather from pursuing a career in music, Ms. Caldwell entered the University of Arkansas as a psychology major. Within a year she was a violin major at Hendrix College in Arkansas. She later earned a scholarship from the New England Conservatory of Music in Boston.         It was her summers in the Berkshires at the Tanglewood Music Institute that shifted her toward opera. There, in 1947, she staged Vaughan Williams's ''Riders to the Sea.'' Her idol, the conductor Serge Koussevitzky, who directed the institute, was so impressed, he invited her to join the faculty the next year. During this period she became an assistant to the conductor Boris Goldovsky, who ran an opera program at the New England Conservatory. By 1952, Ms. Caldwell was running one herself, at Boston University, which she kept going for eight years.         She started her own company, initially called the Opera Group, in 1958 with just $5,000 in seed money. By 1965, renamed the Opera Company of Boston, it had won an important place in American opera. She tried to be everything: administrator, fund-raiser, proselytizer. But her assumption of both the director and conductor roles in her productions cost the company time and money. During rehearsals, the orchestra would often sit idly in the pit, collecting union-scale pay, while Ms. Caldwell dealt with a directorial detail onstage.         When everything came together, however, the productions had the kind of cohesiveness usually achievable only in festival conditions. There was, for example, a critically hailed production of Berlioz's ''Benvenuto Cellini'' in 1975 with Jon Vickers in the title role; another vibrant production was of Verdi's ''Macbeth'' with Shirley Verrett, a frequent Caldwell collaborator who became Boston's favorite diva, as Lady Macbeth.         Ms. Caldwell was generally thought to be more gifted as a director. Her ideas were usually backed by enormous amounts of historical research. But her conducting, while technically idiosyncratic and often untidy, was musical and sensitive. And she was a pioneer of colorblind casting in opera.         Ms. Caldwell's constant search for financial support led her into a political quagmire in 1982. She agreed to develop an opera program in the Philippines, signing a contract with Imelda Marcos, the wife of the country's repressive president, Ferdinand E. Marcos. Ms. Caldwell insisted that the contract was with the Cultural Center of the Philippines, not the government. But in reality Mrs. Marcos was financing the center to help build her political power base. A year later, facing protests at home from human-rights groups and outraged company patrons, Ms. Caldwell pulled out of the deal.         In 1988, she organized an ambitious three-week festival called Making Music Together, which took 250 Soviet dancers, musicians, composers and other artists to Boston for some 80 events. The festival was budgeted at $2.4 million. But when corporate support and ticket sales did not meet expectations, Gov. Michael S. Dukakis, with the intervention of Secretary of State George P. Shultz, bailed Ms. Caldwell out with more state support, averting a diplomatic embarrassment.         For many years Ms. Caldwell lived with her mother in Weston, a Boston suburb. She leaves no immediate survivors.         In 1999, Ms. Caldwell accepted a post as distinguished professor of music at the University of Arkansas, Fayetteville, but left within several years because of poor health. Missing New England, she moved to Freeport in 2003.         Ms. Caldwell never gave up hope that she could raise funds and re-start her company. It was not to be. But for a while, as the British critic Andrew Porter wrote in The New Yorker, she was ''the single best thing about opera in America.''       
         Doris Muscatine, a pioneering chronicler of California's wine and food culture, died Saturday at her home in Berkeley, Calif. She was 80.         Her family said she died as a result of injuries suffered in a fall this month.         Mrs. Muscatine began writing about food and wine in the 1960's, before anyone knew a pinot noir from a merlot or had ever heard of Alice Waters, Chez Panisse and the new American cooking. Her writing helped introduce California cooking, with its emphasis on fresh, locally grown ingredients, to the rest of the country.         ''Doris was a good kind of critic, looking for the positive things,'' said Ms. Waters, the executive chef and owner of Chez Panisse, in Berkeley. ''She was able to sort them out. She was never into the kind of superficial things about food and wine. She wanted to know about the person who ran the restaurant, its history, not just recipes. And that connects to her interest in history.''         As a friend of Ms. Waters, she peeled garlic every year for Chez Panisse's annual garlic festival.         She was an accomplished cook who thought that good ingredients could speak for themselves.         ''Food for her was really a form of cultural and aesthetic expression, one that gave comfort and meaning to peoples' daily lives,'' said her daughter, Lissa Muscatine.         Her food and wine books, which won many awards, include ''A Cook's Tour of Rome,'' ''A Cook's Tour of San Francisco'' and ''The University of California/Sotheby Book of California Wine.''         Mrs. Muscatine was also co-author, with the East Bay restaurateur Narsai David, of ''Monday Night at Narsai's.'' Narsai's was one of the area's most popular restaurants in the 1970's and early 80's.         Until a few weeks ago, Mrs. Muscatine was appearing at book signings to promote her new book, ''The Vinegar of Spilamberto and Other Italian Adventures with Food, Places and People,'' which was published last year by Shoemaker & Hoard.         The book recounts her many visits to Italy, the first in 1958, when her husband, Charles, began studying there on a Fulbright scholarship. With their young children, they explored the country and began a lifelong love of Italian culture, especially its food.         As a historian, Mrs. Muscatine wrote ''Old San Francisco: the Biography of a City From Early Days to the Earthquake'' and was a consultant for the PBS series ''California Dream,'' a history of the state first broadcast in 1981.         She recently completed a culinary oral history and film for the Bancroft Library at the University of California.         Born Doris Corn in New York City, she was reared in Trenton and graduated from Bennington College in Vermont. She studied cooking at the Cordon Bleu in Paris in 1962. She moved to the Bay Area in 1948, when her husband joined the faculty of the University of California, Berkeley.         In addition to her husband and daughter, of Bethesda, Md., she is survived by a son, Jeff, of Palo Alto, Calif., and six grandchildren.       
         Maureen Stapleton, who created a gallery of pugnacious, sometimes profane but always vulnerable heroines on Broadway, in films and on television and who won an Academy Award for her fiery performance as the anarchist Emma Goldman in ''Reds,'' died yesterday at her home in Lenox, Mass. She was 80.         The cause was chronic pulmonary disease, said her son, Daniel Allentuck.         Ms. Stapleton had one of the most honored acting careers of her generation. Her Academy Award for ''Reds,'' Warren Beatty's 1981 epic about the Russian Revolution, came on her fourth Oscar nomination. She also won two Tony Awards and an Emmy among many nominations.         Ms. Stapleton's story embodied the classic theatrical clich√©. A small-town girl nurtured on long afternoons at the movies, she came to New York in 1943 with dreams of becoming a star in the theater. She worked at a variety of jobs -- salesgirl, hotel clerk, artists' model -- while attending acting school. Then, not long after her theatrical baptism in summer stock and a few small roles on Broadway, fortune smiled.         It was 1950. Tennessee Williams had written a play called ''The Rose Tattoo,'' and he wanted the renowned Italian actress Anna Magnani to play the lead role, that of Serafina Delle Rose, an earthy Sicilian-American widow looking for love. But Magnani declined, fearing that her English was inadequate for Broadway. Other actresses were auditioned, without success. Harold Clurman, who had directed Ms. Stapleton earlier that year in Arthur Laurents's ''Bird Cage,'' suggested that the producers audition her. After repeated callbacks, she was told she had the part.         A friend from acting school, Eli Wallach, was cast opposite her as Alvaro Mangiacavallo, the simple but loving truck driver who revives the widow's spirits in a tumultuous courtship.         ''The Rose Tattoo'' opened at the Martin Beck Theater in February 1951. Brooks Atkinson, writing in The New York Times, called the performance ''triumphant'' and praised her ability to convey not only the coarseness of the plainspoken Serafina but also her moments of exaltation. The play ran for 300 performances then toured for six months.         ''The Rose Tattoo'' fulfilled Ms. Stapleton's childhood dream of becoming a star and also earned her a Tony Award. But the stress of her first major role also introduced the demons that would pursue her throughout her career. She began to drink, though she always maintained that she drank only after a performance. (She routinely vomited before curtain time.) She also became convinced that someday, someone in the audience was going to kill her.         Ms. Stapleton's growing paranoia led her to seek out a psychotherapist after the show ended its tour, but a cure for her ills -- she also had a lifelong fear of elevators and airplanes -- proved elusive. One therapist was to treat her for 14 years.         Despite her problems with alcohol and bouts of anxiety, her life seemed to be on a positive track. She married Max Allentuck, general manager for the producer Kermit Bloomgarden. They had a son, Daniel, and a daughter, Katherine. When word came that Williams was ready with a new play, ''Orpheus Descending,'' she was told once again that he wanted Magnani to play the heroine, a frustrated Italian-American storekeeper in a small Southern town whose world is torn apart by the arrival of a handsome newcomer. Magnani declined again, and the role went to Ms. Stapleton.         The play opened on Broadway in March 1957 and drew mixed reviews, but Ms. Stapleton won raves in the lead role of Lady Torrance, Williams's gritty, sex-starved heroine. Cliff Robertson played Val Xavier, the handsome interloper.         The following year she had audiences laughing in the S. N. Behrman comedy ''The Cold Wind and the Warm,'' in which she played a freewheeling matchmaker. She also received her first Emmy nomination for her work in a television adaptation of ''All the King's Men.'' Then Hollywood beckoned, and in her very first film, an adaptation of Nathaniel West's ''Miss Lonelyhearts'' (1959), she was nominated for an Academy Award for best supporting actress, playing a deceitful man-eater.         In 1959 she and Mr. Allentuck were divorced, and she began a relationship with the playwright David Rayfiel, whom she eventually married. But guilt and anxiety over her divorce, she said, drove her further into alcoholism and indulgence. Her weight ballooned. Liquor was a fixture in her dressing room. ''The curtain came down and I went into the vodka,'' she told an interviewer. She later said that in many ways she had been reliving a painful childhood.         Lois Maureen Stapleton was born on June 21, 1925, in Troy, N.Y. She remembered her father, John, as ''a prodigious drinker'' who had endless battles with her mother, Irene, until they separated when Maureen was a child. She was an unhappy, overweight girl who spent hours at the movies, where, she said, she would ''dream myself right onto the screen.'' She fantasized about someday becoming a Jean Harlow or a Barbara Stanwyck.         When she was old enough to work, her goal was to save $100 to move to New York City and become an actress; in 1943, she left Troy for Manhattan, where she and a friend shared a $45-a-month apartment.         ''I was 17 years old, I weighed 180 pounds and I had a hundred bucks in my pocket,'' she recalled. ''I was invincible.''         She enrolled at the New School, where she studied acting with Herbert Berghof, and in 1947 joined the Actors Studio. But she eventually grew impatient with some of the excesses of Lee Strasberg's Method approach to acting. Even so, she remembered the Studio as ''a special working place.'' Her colleagues included Montgomery Clift, Julie Harris, Marlon Brando, Anne Jackson and Mr. Wallach, and her apartment became an actors' hangout. It was among the happiest times of her life.         Once established on Broadway and in films and television, she was rarely idle. She appeared on Broadway with Jason Robards in Lillian Hellman's ''Toys in the Attic'' in 1960 and in the film version of ''Orpheus,'' retitled ''The Fugitive Kind.'' Williams got his wish, though, and Anna Magnani played Lady Torrance onscreen while Ms. Stapleton settled for a lesser role. Ms. Stapleton had an earlier disappointment when Magnani won an Academy Award for best actress as Serafina in the 1955 film version of ''The Rose Tattoo.''         By this time, she was married again, to Mr. Rayfiel, but her drinking was out of control. She was hospitalized for detoxification, after which she voluntarily entered a psychiatric facility. Her second marriage lasted three years. A few months after her divorce, she returned to the role that had made her a star, appearing as Serafina opposite Harry Guardino in a revival of ''The Rose Tattoo'' at the City Center.         In 1967 she won an Emmy for her television work in ''Among the Paths to Eden,'' an adaptation of a Truman Capote story about a spinster and a widower. (When an interviewer asked her if she minded being regularly cast as an older woman -- something that began early in her career -- she merely shrugged and said, ''I was born old.'')         A year later she was cast opposite George C. Scott in Neil Simon's comedy ''Plaza Suite,'' staged by Mike Nichols. She and Mr. Scott played three different warring couples to hilarious effect, and her performance won her another Tony nomination.         The awards and nominations kept coming. She was nominated for an Oscar as best supporting actress for ''Airport'' (1970); she won a best-actress Tony that same year for her portrayal of an alcoholic down-and-out singer in Mr. Simon's laughing-through-tears drama ''The Gingerbread Lady''; she and her co-star, Charles Durning, received Emmy nominations for ''Queen of the Stardust Ballroom'' (1975), playing a couple who warm to romance when they meet at a dance hall.         Another Oscar nomination, for supporting actress, followed her work in Woody Allen's 1978 drama, ''Interiors.'' In 1981, she was nominated for a Tony for ''The Little Foxes,'' in which she played the battered Aunt Birdie opposite Elizabeth Taylor in the lead role, Regina. In his review in The Times, Frank Rich called her ''a wonder'' and added, ''such is this actress's talent that she can conjure abject terror out of silence and thin air.'' It turned out to be her last appearance on Broadway.         But her movie career continued, perhaps most memorably as the revolutionary Goldman in ''Reds.'' The performance won her the Oscar for best supporting actress. Her film credits also included ''Cocoon'' (1985) and its sequel, as one of a group of Florida retirees rejuvenated by extraterrestrials, and ''Nuts'' (1987), in which she played the mother of a high-priced call girl (Barbra Streisand).         When her grandchildren were born, Ms. Stapleton moved to Lenox to be near family, namely her daughter, Katharine Allentuck Bambery, her grandson Max and her granddaughter Alexandra, all of whom survive her, along with her son, Daniel, of Manhattan, and a brother, John, of Troy. (She was not related to the actress Jean Stapleton, as many people have thought.)         In Lenox she doted on her grandchildren and continued to accept the occasional role, playing a woman dying of ovarian cancer in the television drama ''Last Wish'' (1992) and appearing opposite Armin Mueller-Stahl in the 1994 film ''The Last Good Time.''         She also wrote her autobiography, ''A Hell of a Life,'' with Jane Scovell in 1995, in which she looked back on a life in the theater with a few regrets but a lot of satisfaction. When the curtain went up or the camera rolled, she said, ''I did the best I could.''         But what she loved most, she wrote, was ''the challenge and the opportunity to leave reality behind and become someone else.''         Correction:  March 20, 2006, Monday  An obituary of the actress Maureen Stapleton on Tuesday misspelled the given name of the author of the novel that inspired her first film, ''Miss Lonelyhearts.'' He was Nathanael West, not Nathaniel.       
         Madeleine Pelner Cosman, a prominent writer, scholar and lecturer whose passion for what she called the ''glorious order'' of the past led her first to a career in medieval and Renaissance studies and more recently to wide public advocacy of tougher immigration laws, died on March 2 in Escondido, Calif. She was 68.         The cause was complications of scleroderma, a chronic disease of the connective tissue, her family said. Ms. Cosman, who moved to California in the late 1990's, was for decades a resident of Tenafly, N.J.         A longtime faculty member at the City College of New York, Ms. Cosman founded the Institute for Medieval and Renaissance Studies there in 1968 and was its director for many years. The institute closed in 1993, when Ms. Cosman retired. In the 1970's and afterward, she helped organize the annual medieval festival at the Cloisters in Upper Manhattan and spoke frequently at the Metropolitan Museum of Art and elsewhere about daily life in the Middle Ages.         The author of nearly a dozen books, Ms. Cosman was best known to popular audiences for ''Fabulous Feasts: Medieval Cookery and Ceremony'' (George Braziller, 1976). An illustrated study of culinary practice in the Middle Ages, it also included recipes for dishes like roseye (fried fish in a rose-petal sauce), mulled wine and peppermint rice.         Ms. Cosman took her work seriously. She could sing madrigals, play the lute and eat with her fingers off a trencher in the proper medieval style. Her house in suburban New Jersey was appointed with ornately carved period furniture. Arms and armor lay about, the walls were hung with Flemish tapestries, and the cellar was stocked with mead.         On special occasions, visitors might find Ms. Cosman, wearing a flowing velvet gown, presiding over an elegant table that could include blankmangere en doucette (chicken cooked with cumin and cream, served in pastry) and lentil mawmenye (a lamb and lentil stew). Utensils were not supplied.         Apart from medieval food and birthday cake, the only thing Ms. Cosman knew how to cook was hamburger, a dish that took her nearly 15 years to master. Her family was fond of hamburger, which was always served by candlelight.         Ms. Cosman could also play the piano, fly an airplane and shoot a gun. In the 1980's and early 90's, she made her living buying and selling medical practices, and in the mid-90's, when she was in her late 50's, she became a lawyer. In recent years, she worked as a health-care policy analyst and was a volunteer patrolwoman with the San Diego County Sheriff's Department.         At her death, Ms. Cosman was a member of the board of the California Rifle and Pistol Association. She was also on the board of the Wake Up America Foundation, which opposes illegal immigration, and was frequently heard discussing the issue on talk radio.         Madeleine Pelner was born in Brooklyn on Dec. 4, 1937, the oldest of three daughters of Louis Pelner and the former Lillian Rosen. She received a bachelor's degree from Barnard in 1959, a master's from Hunter in 1960 and a Ph.D. in English and comparative literature from Columbia in 1964. In 1995, she earned a law degree from the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University.         As a Jewish child growing up during World War II, Madeleine was acutely conscious of the need for self-protection, something she later discussed in interviews. As a young woman, she learned to shoot. If the knock on the door were to come, Madeleine Pelner would be ready. By the time she was in college, her devotion to the concept of personal responsibility had led her to the writings of Ayn Rand, whose libertarian ideas she embraced.         Ms. Cosman's diverse work was united by her interest in the history of medicine. As a scholar of medieval medicine, she found that early medical treatises often included descriptions of food thought to be curative. This led to ''Fabulous Feasts.'' She was later the founder and president of Medical Equity, a brokerage of medical and surgical practices.         Most recently, Ms. Cosman's interest in health care policy led her to study the effects of illegal immigration on the United States health-care system. Her article ''Illegal Aliens and American Medicine,'' published last year in The Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons, has been widely reproduced on anti-immigration and other conservative Web sites.         Ms. Cosman's husband, Bard, a plastic surgeon whom she married in 1958, died in 1983. Survivors include a daughter, Marin, of Scarsdale, N.Y.; a son, Bard, of La Jolla, Calif.; and four grandchildren. Information on other survivors could not be confirmed.         Ms. Cosman also leaves behind a vast library of illuminated manuscripts and a large collection of handguns.       
         Jane Jacobs, the writer and thinker who brought penetrating eyes and ingenious insight to the sidewalk ballet of her own Greenwich Village street and came up with a book that challenged and changed the way people view cities, died yesterday in Toronto, where she moved in 1968. She was 89.         She died at a Toronto hospital, said a distant cousin, Lucia Jacobs, who gave no specific cause of death.         In her book ''The Death and Life of Great American Cities,'' written in 1961, Ms. Jacobs's enormous achievement was to transcend her own withering critique of 20th-century urban planning and propose radically new principles for rebuilding cities.         At a time when both common and inspired wisdom called for bulldozing slums and opening up city space, Ms. Jacobs's prescription was ever more diversity, density and dynamism -- in effect, to crowd people and activities together in a joyous urban jumble.         Her critique of the nation's cities is often grouped with the work of writers who in the 1960's shook the foundations of American society: Paul Goodman's attack on schooling; Michael Harrington's stark portrait of poverty; Ralph Nader's barrage against the auto industry; and Malcolm X's grim tour of America's racial divide, among others. And it continues to influence a third generation of students.         ''Death and Life'' made four basic recommendations for creating municipal diversity: 1. A street or district must serve several primary functions. 2. Blocks must be short. 3. Buildings must vary in age, condition and use. 4. Population must be dense.         Ms. Jacobs's thesis was enlarged by her deep, eclectic reading. But most compelling was her description of the everyday life she witnessed from her home above a candy store at 555 Hudson Street, near 11th Street.         In that description, she puts out her garbage, children go to school, the dry cleaner and the barber open their shops, women come out to chat, longshoremen visit the local bar, teenagers return from school and change to go out on dates, and another day is played out. Sometimes, odd things happen: a bagpiper shows up on a February night, and delighted listeners gather around. Whether neighbors or strangers, people are safer because they are almost never alone.         ''People who know well such animated city streets will know how it is,'' Ms. Jacobs wrote. ''I am afraid people who do not will always have it a little wrong in their heads, like the old prints of rhinoceroses made from travelers' descriptions of rhinoceroses.''         Robert Caro, the historian, said in an interview yesterday that Ms. Jacobs was far from the first urban theorist to stress the importance of neighborhood and community. ''But no one had ever said it so brilliantly before,'' he said. ''She gave voice to something that needed a voice.''         Some critics used adjectives like ''triumphant'' and ''seminal'' to describe ''Death and Life.'' Others, not a few of whom with an ax to grind, were less kind. Lewis Mumford, the critic and social historian whom Ms. Jacobs eviscerated in the book, suggested in a review in The New Yorker that she had displayed ''aesthetic philistinism with a vengeance.''         The battles she ignited are still being fought, and the criticism was perhaps inevitable, given that such an ambitious work was produced by somebody who had not finished college, much less become an established professional in the field.         Indisputably, the book was as radically challenging to conventional thinking as Rachel Carson's ''Silent Spring,'' which helped engender the environmental movement, would be the next year, and Betty Friedan's ''The Feminine Mystique,'' which deeply affected perceptions of relations between the sexes, would be in 1963.         Like those two writers, Ms. Jacobs was able to summon a freshness of perspective. Some dismissed it as amateurism, but to many others it was a point of view that made new ideas not only thinkable but suddenly and eminently reasonable.         ''When an entire field is headed in the wrong direction, when the routine application of mainstream thinking has produced disastrous results as I think was true of planning and urban policy in the 1950's, then it probably took someone from outside to point out the obvious,'' Alan Ehrenhalt wrote in 2001 in Planning, the magazine of the American Planning Association.         ''That is what Jane Jacobs did 40 years ago,'' he said.         Action, Not Just Words         Ms. Jacobs did not limit her impact to words. In 1961, she and other protestors were removed from a City Planning Commission hearing on an urban renewal plan for Greenwich Village that they opposed, after they leapt from their seats and rushed the podium.         In 1968, she was arrested on riot and criminal mischief charges for disrupting a public meeting on the construction of an expressway that would have sliced across Lower Manhattan and displaced hundreds of families and businesses. The police said she had tried to tear up the stenographer's transcript tape.         The battle against that highway pitted Ms. Jacobs in an uphill fight against Robert Moses, the autocratic and immensely powerful master builder of that era. The expressway's opponents won.         Ms. Jacobs moved to Toronto in 1968 out of opposition to the Vietnam War and to shield her two draft-age sons from military duty, and quickly enlisted in Toronto's urban battles. No sooner had she arrived than she led a battle to stop a freeway there.         She became a beloved intellectual pioneer characterized by a dumpling face, an impish smile, sneakers, bangs and owlish glasses. But Roger Starr, a former New York City housing administrator and sometime opponent of Ms. Jacobs, keenly noted the steel just beneath her folksiness.         ''What a dear, sweet character she isn't,'' he said.         After she was removed from the Planning Commission hearing in 1961, her own words underlined her feistiness. ''We had been ladies and gentlemen and only got pushed around,'' she said.         But fighting with government, even being arrested with Susan Sontag and Allen Ginsberg in an antidraft protest, was something she said she had repeatedly been forced into by ''outrageous'' governmental actions.         What she hated most about those actions was that they took time away from her writing, which she said was her way of thinking. And in at least five fields of inquiry, she thought deeply and innovatively: urban design, urban history, regional economics, the morality of the economy and the nature of economic growth.         Each of her major books led naturally to the next. From writing about how people functioned within cities, she analyzed how cities function within nations, how nations function with one another, how everyone functions in a world of conflicting moral principles and, finally, how economies grow like biological organisms.         A small book in 1980 arguing for Quebec separatism created a stir in Canada, while a 1996 memoir of her great-aunt's experience as a schoolteacher in rural Alaska, which she edited, impressed reviewers with its homespun wisdom.         But it is ''Death and Life,'' published by Random House, that rocked the planning and architectural establishment.         On one level, it represented the first liberal attack on the liberal idea of urban renewal. At the same time, the New York Times critic Brooks Atkinson saw an old-fashioned vision of community that he compared to Thornton Wilder's fictional Grover's Corners. Ms. Jacobs herself thought the book's continuing appeal was that it plumbed the depths of human nature like a good novel.         In 2003, Herbert Muschamp, the Times's chief architecture critic, wrote that Ms. Jacobs's book was ''one of 20th-century architecture's most traumatic events,'' in part because Ms. Jacobs was dismissive about the importance of design.         In recent years, she became an inspiration to architects and planners who espouse what they call the New Urbanism, an effort to promote social interaction by incorporating such Jacobean features as ground-floor stores in suburban developments.         Patrick Pinnell, an architect associated with this school, said ''Death and Life'' represented almost the last expression of optimism about American cities. As early as 1974, John E. Zuccotti, then chairman of the New York City Planning Commission, called Ms. Jacobs a prophet and himself a ''neo-Jacobean'' when he announced a smaller-scale, more sensitive urban planning approach. Ms. Jacobs was born Jane Butzner on May 4, 1916, in Scranton, Pa. Her father was a physician and her mother a schoolteacher. She remembered being something of a troublemaker in school, engaging in pranks like exploding inflated paper bags in the lunchroom. She preferred reading books surreptitiously to listening to the teacher.         In an interview in Azure magazine in 1997, Ms. Jacobs recounted her habit of carrying on imaginary conversations with Thomas Jefferson while running errands. When she could think of nothing more to tell Jefferson, she replaced him with Benjamin Franklin.         ''Like Jefferson, he was interested in lofty things, but also in nitty-gritty, down-to-earth details,'' she said, ''such as why the alley we were walking through wasn't paved, and who would pave it if it were paved. He was interested in everything, so he was a very satisfying companion.''         Years later, she realized that she had developed her talent of working through difficult ideas in simple terms by practicing them on her imaginary Franklin. She also acquired another inner companion through Alfred Duggan, an English historical novelist. He was Cerdic, a Saxon chieftain. Years later, she continued to chat with him while doing housework.         ''There were only two things in the entire house that were familiar to him,'' she wrote; ''the fire (although he didn't understand the chimney) and the sword,'' a Civil War souvenir. ''Everything else had to be explained to him.''         Not wanting to go to college, she took an unpaid position as assistant to the women's editor at The Scranton Tribune. In 1934, she moved to New York to join her sister, who was six years older and had a job in the home furnishings department of Abraham & Straus, the Brooklyn department store. The sisters lived on the top floor of a six-story walkup in Brooklyn Heights.         Subways Lead to Jobs         Each day, Ms. Jacobs got on the subway and arbitrarily chose a stop at which to get off and look for a job. Because she liked the sound of Christopher Street, she got off there and found an apartment in Greenwich Village and soon after, a job as a secretary in a candy manufacturing company.         She worked as a secretary for five years. The sisters did not have much money and sometimes lived on Pablum and bananas, Ms. Jacobs said in an interview with Metropolis Magazine in 2001.         She began writing articles then, first for a metals-trade paper. She sold a series of articles about different areas of the city, like the fur district, to Vogue, earning $40 for each at a time when she was making $12 a week as a secretary. She wrote Sunday features for The New York Herald Tribune and articles for Q Magazine on manhole covers, among other things.         While working full time, she attended Columbia University's School of General Studies for two years and took courses in geology, zoology, law, political science and economics. In 1944, Ms. Jacobs, who was then working for the Office of War Information, and her two roommates had a party in their apartment. One guest was Robert Hyde Jacobs Jr., an architect who specialized in hospital design. They met in April and married in May.         Ms. Jacobs told Azure that she would not have written any books without her husband's encouragement. It was he who decided that the family should move to Toronto in 1968 after their sons said they would go to jail rather than serve in Vietnam. Mr. Jacobs died in 1996. Ms. Jacobs is survived by her sons, James, of Toronto, and Ned, of Vancouver; her daughter, Burgin Jacobs, of New Denver, British Columbia, and one granddaughter.         Suspicions Aroused         In 1952, Ms. Jacobs got a job as an editor at Architectural Forum, where she stayed for 10 years. That gave her a perch from which to observe urban renewal projects. On a visit to Philadelphia, she noticed that the streets of a project were deserted while an older, nearby street was crowded.         ''So, I got very suspicious of this whole thing,'' she told The Toronto Star in 1997. ''I pointed that out to the designer, but it was absolutely uninteresting to him. How things worked didn't interest him.         ''He wasn't concerned about its attractiveness to people. His notion was totally aesthetic, divorced from everything else.''         Her doubts increased after William Kirk, the director of the Union Settlement in East Harlem, taught her new ways of seeing neighborhoods. She came to see the prevalent planning notions, which involved bulldozing low-rise housing in poor neighborhoods and replacing it with tall apartment buildings surrounded by open space, as a superstition akin to early 19th-century physicians' belief in bloodletting.         ''There is a quality even meaner than outright ugliness or disorder,'' she wrote in ''Death and Life,'' ''and this meaner quality is the dishonest mask of pretended order, achieved by ignoring or suppressing the real order that is struggling to exist and to be served.''         William H. Whyte, the editor of Fortune magazine and the author of books about urban life as well as his celebrated ''Organization Man,'' asked Ms. Jacobs to write an article for Fortune on urban downtowns in 1958. Her essay, which was reprinted in ''The Exploding Metropolis'' (Doubleday, 1958), turned out to be a trial run for her book.         ''Designing a dream city is easy,'' she concluded. ''Rebuilding a living one takes imagination.''         The Fortune article caught the attention of the Rockefeller Foundation, which offered her a grant in 1958 to write about cities. Two grants and three years later, she produced her manuscript for ''Death and Life'' on the Remington typewriter that she used until her death.         Her seemingly simple prescriptions for neighborhood diversity, short blocks, dense populations and a mix of buildings represented a major rethinking of modern planning. They were coupled with fierce condemnations of the writings of the planners Sir Patrick Geddes and Ebenezer Howard, as well as those of the architect Le Corbusier and Lewis Mumford, who championed the ideal of graceful towers rising over exquisite open spaces. Mr. Mumford held his fire for a year before replying in a New Yorker article, sardonically titled ''Home Remedies for Urban Cancer.''         ''Like a construction gang bulldozing a site clean of all habitations, good or bad,'' Mr. Mumford wrote, ''she bulldozes out of existence every desirable innovation in urban planning during the last century, and every competing idea, without even a pretense of critical evaluation.''         Form Over Substance?         Even the architecture critic Paul Goldberger, while expressing profound admiration for Ms. Jacobs in a New York Times article in 1996, suggested that she may have overstated the importance of the physical form of cities.         ''Sometimes big, ugly high-rise towers work just fine,'' he wrote.         Ms. Jacobs next book, ''The Economy of Cities'' (Random House, 1969), challenged the ideas that cities were established on a rural economic base; rather, she suggested, rural economies have been built directly through city economies. After that came ''The Question of Separatism: Quebec and the Struggle for Sovereignty'' (Random House, 1980). It argued that Canada and Quebec would be better off without each other, on the general grounds that smaller is better.         She delved more deeply into economics and cities with ''Cities and the Wealth of Nations: Principles of Economic Life'' (Random House, 1984), in which she contended that national governments undermine the economy of cities, which she saw as the natural engines of economic growth.         Her ''Systems of Survival: A Dialogue on the Moral Foundations of Commerce and Politics'' (Vintage, 1994) looks at the moral underpinnings of work by examining different value systems. ''The Nature of Economies'' (Modern Library, 2000) likens economic activity to an ecosystem. Her last book, ''Dark Age Ahead'' (Random House, 2004), argues that North American culture is collapsing, then suggests ways to reverse the trend.         During her last years, Canadians held conferences to honor Ms. Jacobs. For New Yorkers, she lived on in the famous photo of her with a beer and a cigarette in the White Horse Tavern in Greenwich Village, as well as memories of her plotting municipal mischief at another Village hangout. To generations of planners, architects and students of cities, Ms. Jacobs remains a seminal influence.         She perhaps perceived herself as an intellectual adventurer ready and able to follow her quixotic, often brilliant instincts into ever more fascinating terrain.         In ''Systems of Survival,'' one of her characters worried that he was not qualified.         ''Why not us?'' replied the man who had invited the group together. ''If more qualified people are up to the same thing, more power to them. But we don't know that, do we?''       
         Muriel Spark, known for her finely polished, darkly comic prose and for the unforgettable Miss Jean Brodie, one of the funniest and most sinister characters in modern fiction, died Friday at a hospital in Florence, Italy. She was 88.         Ms. Spark's death was announced yesterday, The Associated Press reported, by Massimiliano Dindalini, the mayor of the Tuscan village of Civitella della Chiana, where she had lived for almost 30 years.         Her work, unlocked from her innermost memories of her experiences before and after her conversion to Roman Catholicism in 1954, built a canon of short, sometimes macabre, sometimes humorous novels that sought to pare away the absurdities of human behavior.         Ms. Spark's first novel was published when she was 39, and after that she supplied a stream of slender novels and enigmatic short stories peopled with such curiosities as narrators from beyond the grave, flying saucers, grandmotherly smugglers with bread bins full of diamond-studded loaves and individuals of so little substance that they disappear when the door closes.         In her writing, evil is never far away, violence is a regular visitor and death is a constant companion. Her themes were generally serious but nearly always handled with a feather-light touch.         It is this lightness, and a contrived detachment toward her characters, that became the target of the harshest criticism of her work, which at her death included more than 20 novels, several collections of short stories, poetry, criticism, biography, plays and a handful of children's books.         Some accused her of coolness and even cruelty toward the characters she invented and then sent -- sometimes quite merrily -- to terrible deaths.         ''People say my novels are cruel because cruel things happen and I keep this even tone,'' she said in an interview in The New Yorker. ''I'm often very deadpan, but there's a moral statement too, and what it's saying is that there's a life beyond this, and these events are not the most important things. They're not important in the long run.''         She was born Muriel Sarah Camberg in Edinburgh on Feb. 1, 1918, the daughter of Bernard Camberg, an engineer whose Jewish family had settled earlier in Scotland, and his wife, the former Sarah Elizabeth Maud Uezzell, a Protestant from a country village near London.         When she was 5 she began attending James Gillespie's High School for Girls, where she became one of the cr√®me de la cr√®me of students selected for a specialized and somewhat unorthodox curriculum by Christina Kay, the teacher who would become the model for the protagonist in ''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie'' (1961), which was later adapted for the stage and film.         Muriel Camberg acquired her Spark from her brief, and as she had put it, ''disastrous,'' marriage at the age of 19 to Sydney Oswald Spark, 13 years her senior, who was about to leave Scotland to teach in Africa.         He was known as S. O. S., a fitting nickname, it turned out, when his mental instability and violence led her to end the marriage after seven miserable years. ''He became a borderline case, and I didn't like what I found on either side of the border,'' she wrote in her 1992 autobiography, ''Curriculum Vitae.''         They lived in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), and their union produced her only child, a son, Robin.         She kept the name Spark, partly for her son's sake and partly because she thought it had ''some ingredient of life and of fun.''         She longed to return to Britain, but she was trapped in Rhodesia for most of World War II because of wartime restrictions on travel. She finally succeeded in returning aboard a troopship in 1944, leaving her son, then 6, in the care of convent nuns in Central Africa until the war was over.         Once home, she went to London in search of work, taking up residence at the Helena Club, which later became the model for the May of Teck Club, the setting for her 1963 novel, ''The Girls of Slender Means.''         Propaganda and Poetry         In London she landed a job with the Foreign Office in a secret division that disseminated black propaganda, a brand of disinformation she described as ''detailed truth with believable lies.'' The reports, broadcast on what masqueraded as a German radio station, used real names and addresses to lend veracity to invented stories, and the announcers were German prisoners of war. Although the fabricated news items were aimed at undermining the Nazis, there were times when they worked too well and surfaced as news in the British press.         After the war she worked at a jewelry trade publication, Argentor, in London, joined the Poetry Society and later became editor of its Poetry Review, a job that lasted for two tempestuous years before she was dismissed. Her innovations there included paying for worthy submissions and ending the practice of accepting payments from poets, a change that drastically altered the content of the review and outraged its establishment.         She founded a short-lived literary magazine, then went to work for a publishing house, devoting the remainder of her time to writing poetry, doing book reviews and writing and editing scholarly works, including the letters of John Henry Cardinal Newman.         Ms. Spark said she discovered through the writings of Cardinal Newman that the foundations of the Roman Catholic church corresponded with her personal convictions. She described her conversion to Catholicism as a natural step in her life. ''There was no blinding revelation in my case,'' she wrote in her autobiography.         Her first novel, ''The Comforters'' (1957), was born of religion and delusions. Newly converted and living in London in 1954, during the period of postwar food rationing, Ms. Spark ate little and chased away her hunger with Dexedrine, a combination that led to a period of hallucinations. The words she had once manipulated turned on her, trapping her in a fog of anagrams and crosswords and convincing her that a code ran through the literature she read.         After a few months, she sought medical help and stopped taking the amphetamines, but remained weak and ill. It was at this troubled time in Ms. Spark's life that Graham Greene stepped in, and for a while she was sustained by the money he sent, along with bottles of red wine, which, she wrote, ''took the edge off cold charity.''         In ''The Comforters,'' a young woman recovering from a breakdown finds that she is a character in a novel that is being written on a phantom typewriter that only she can hear.         Religion is present in Ms. Spark's work in a variety of guises, from the unseen and unforgiving hand in ''Memento Mori'' (1959) to the hypocrisy of self-righteously pious characters like the couple in the short story ''The Black Madonna.'' Later in her life, the issue of her religious heritage became a persistent irritant.         She traced the seeds of ''Memento Mori,'' her third novel, to her childhood, when she learned about old age and human frailty at close range, caring for her dying grandmother. Although the novel is steeped in death and deception it is at times unabashedly hilarious. In the book, one elderly person after another in a close circle gets a mysterious phone call with a simple message: ''Remember, you must die.'' This slim novel about confronting mortality, packed with sex, blackmail and mystery, was adapted for the stage.         While Ms. Spark's books cover a broad territory of plot and character, some central similarities can be found in many of the novels and short stories.         Michiko Kakutani, in a review of Ms. Spark's novel ''Reality and Dreams'' in The New York Times in 1997, described the author's approach as a recipe: ''Take a self-enclosed community (of writers, schoolgirls, nuns, rich people, etc.) that is full of incestuous liaisons and fraternal intrigue; toss in a bombshell (like murder, suicide or betrayal) that will ricochet dangerously around this little world; and add some allusions to the supernatural to ground these melodramatics in an old-fashioned context of good and evil. Serve up with crisp, authoritative prose and present with 'a light and heartless hand.' ''         Delving Into School Secrets         This recipe appears with variations in novels including ''The Ballad of Peckham Rye'' (1960) , in which a truly devilish young man who calls himself an industrial analyst insinuates himself into the life of a community and goes about creating suspicion among neighbors, delving into personal secrets and destroying lives.         It reappears in ''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,'' which provides a memorable example of a small and controlled community -- a girls school in Edinburgh in the 1930's -- in which the imperious teacher molds lives in a way few educators can.         ''Give me a girl at an impressionable age and she will be mine for life,'' intones the elegant Miss Brodie, who does not care whether her charges know their history or arithmetic as long as they have an appreciation of the finer things: art, Mussolini, proper care of the complexion, Franco.         She captivates her students and enriches their lives while exerting unnatural control, grooming them to serve her will, whether in the bed of one of her lovers, as her personal spy or as a martyr to one of her political causes. Her single-mindedness in devoting her ''prime'' to her students has consequences for every life she touches, from the men who love her to the student who is the author of her undoing.         Jay Presson Allen's adaptation for the stage became a vehicle in London in 1964 for Vanessa Redgrave, on Broadway in 1968 for Zoe Caldwell, who won a Tony for her performance, and in Hollywood in 1969 for Maggie Smith, who won an Oscar for best actress in the role.         No other book by Ms. Spark has received the widespread popular acclaim and exposure of ''The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie,'' but in subsequent interviews, the author expressed a firm preference for dwelling on the future rather than the past.         In 1965 she published ''The Mandelbaum Gate,'' a heftier book and one that seems overstuffed by her standards. Set in Jerusalem against the backdrop of the war-crimes trial of Adolf Eichmann, ''The Mandelbaum Gate'' tackles questions of religion, memory and history superimposed on a torturous plot. The book won the James Tait Black Memorial prize.         In ''The Driver's Seat,'' published in 1970, a woman embarks on a wild search through Europe for the man who will kill her. With ''Hothouse on the East River'' in 1973, she moved the locale to New York, and the next year she responded to the Watergate scandal with ''The Abbess of Crewe,'' her own tale of burglars and stolen secrets set in yet another type of institution -- a convent. ''The Only Problem,'' in 1984, returns to the book of Job for inspiration.         Divine retribution of a sort neatly ties up her book ''Aiding and Abetting'' (2000), a fictional tale of a real man, Lord Lucan, known as Lucky, who killed his children's nanny, whom he apparently mistook for his wife in the dark, severely battered his wife, then disappeared, with the help of his friends. In the novel, two men claim to be the aging Lord Lucan, and both present themselves to a very high-priced Paris therapist who is fleeing her own past -- that of a fraudulent stigmatic.         Her last book, ''The Finishing School'' (2004), revisits the themes of boarding schools and envy.         Ms. Spark was awarded the Order of the British Empire in 1967, became a Dame of the British Empire in 1993 and in 1997 won the David Cohen Literature Prize for lifetime achievement.         She took issue, however, with the label ''British writer.'' She told one interviewer, ''I am Scottish by formation.'' She pointed out repeatedly that the bulk of her life had been spent in other countries. After London, she lived briefly in New York in the 1960's, then abandoned the crush of the literary world for Rome, where she had a rich social life and entertained lavishly.         Alliance and Estrangement         In Rome, she met the painter and sculptor Penelope Jardine, who became her secretary and later her companion. The two women traveled together, lived together, and over the years their lives grew deeply intertwined.         Interviewers repeatedly asked about the nature of the relationship of the two women who spent so many years together. Ms. Spark brushed aside the idea that their involvement was romantic; it was characterized as an ''old-fashioned friendship.''         Ms. Jardine purchased a sprawling medieval church compound in Tuscany, and they ultimately settled there. There Ms. Spark settled into her routine of writing in her favorite composition books, in longhand, using only pens untouched by other human hands, and rarely rewriting or revising what flowed from those pens. Ms. Jardine handled the business of everyday life, down to the typing of Ms. Spark's work.         When asked in an interview what she contributed to the household, Ms. Spark said she made her own bed, took morning tea to Ms. Jardine and took her out to meals. ''I think I pull my weight somehow or other,'' she said.         She saw her craft, she said in a 2004 interview, as driven by inspiration from an ''outside force'' unlocking memory in a manner derived from her reading of Marcel Proust.         ''It inspired me more than anything,'' she said at the time. ''I wouldn't have wanted to write like Proust, but I could see what you could do with memory. I could see what you could do with incidents. It was after reading Proust that I found I rather liked writing prose.''         In her later years it became clear that she and her son, Robin, a painter who lives in Edinburgh, were irreconcilably estranged over various issues, including what he referred to as her abandonment of him, as well as her opinions about his ability as an artist and his public statements about their heritage.         Ms. Spark was harsh in her public criticism of his work and open about their estrangement. She told a newspaper: ''He can't sell his lousy paintings, and I have had a lot of success. He keeps sending them to me and I don't know what to do with them. I can't put them on my wall. He's never done anything for me, except for being one big bore.''         Their public feud extended to their religions and spilled into letters to newspapers and became a part of Ms. Spark's literary history when she donated letters from her son to the National Library of Scotland. Mr. Spark, who embraced Judaism about the same time his mother converted to Roman Catholicism, insisted that her mother had been Jewish, which by matrilineal inheritance would make him Jewish by birth; Ms. Spark, who considered herself only half-Jewish, maintained that though her father was Jewish, her mother was not.         Critics have disagreed on how to classify her work, which is alternately bleak and side-splitting. John Updike spoke of ''fun-house plots, full of trapdoors, abrupt apparitions and smartly clicking secret panels.'' Barbara Grizzuti Harrison called her a ''profoundly serious comic writer whose wit advances, never undermines or diminishes, her ideas.''         Taking the opposite view, Robert Maurer questioned the emotional underpinnings of her fiction, writing, ''One wonders how vast a reserve of sympathy lies beneath the iceberg of her consciousness, and how far beyond trickery her work would go if she let it show through.''         Ms. Spark said in several interviews that she would rather not fit neatly into any literary category. ''I have a comic strain, but my novels are serious,'' she said in 1993. ''Sometimes one makes one's own category, you know.''         Correction:  July 18, 2006, Tuesday  An obituary on April 16 about the novelist Muriel Spark misstated the date of her death. It was April 13, not April 14. The error was pointed out by a reader last week; the correction was further delayed for research.       
         Flora Gill Jacobs, an internationally recognized authority on dollhouses who spent her adult life blissfully awash in minutiae, including tiny, lavishly appointed mansions and an ornate Mexican villa that came with its own chapel (very small priest included), died on May 31 in Washington. She was 87 and lived in Chevy Chase, Md.         The cause was congestive heart failure, her family said.         For many years, Ms. Jacobs presided over the Washington Dolls' House and Toy Museum, which she founded in 1975 and ran for nearly three decades, usually at a loss. Her work there, and her writings, were credited with creating interest in dollhouse collecting in the United States in the second half of the 20th century.         While there are many museums of dolls in this country, Ms. Jacobs's, a result of six decades of ardent collecting, was believed to be the first here devoted primarily to dolls' homes. In its heyday, it attracted more than 20,000 visitors annually, most of them adults.         Six days a week, Ms. Jacobs went to the museum to fuss, dust and instruct. As she told The Washington Post in 1988, ''I hardly ever go out into the life-size world.''         She closed the museum in 2004, citing rising costs and advancing age.         A newspaperwoman by training, Ms. Jacobs wrote many highly regarded books on dollhouses, among them ''A History of Dolls' Houses: Four Centuries of the Domestic World in Miniature'' (Scribner, 1953); ''Dolls' Houses in America: Historic Preservation in Miniature'' (Scribner, 1974); and, most recently, ''The Small World of Antique Dolls' Houses'' (Lake Isle Press, 2005).         The first known dollhouse was made in the mid-16th century, and since then dolls' houses have inflamed the acquisitive passions of generations of collectors. A dollhouse lets its owner preside over a miniature cosmos. It affords control, or at least the illusion of it, in a disorderly world. One can make all the aesthetic decisions, and do all the wiring, without ever having to argue with contractors.         The finest dollhouses have electric lights that turn on; running water (cold, usually); libraries with tiny printed books that can be taken down and read; and kitchen stoves that can be fired up. They can contain ornate chandeliers; scaled-down fine furniture; minute sterling tea sets; and little household pets, often made from fur-coat scraps.         For Ms. Jacobs, the attraction went beyond even these things. To her, an antique dollhouse was social history in microcosm, offering a meticulous record of the architecture and decorative arts of its era. And today, with many real historic buildings falling to the wrecker's ball, dollhouses, as she often said, offer a small way of preserving the past.         Flora Gill was born in Washington on Dec. 22, 1918. Growing up, she did not have a dollhouse, but the girl next door did -- a magnificent one that her father, a soldier in World War I, had brought back from Germany.         While Flora was still a student at George Washington University, she wrote film reviews for the old Washington Times-Herald. She left college for a job on the paper, eventually becoming the fashion editor. She later went to work as a reporter for The Washington Post, where she was assigned to the women's page.         In 1940, she married Ephraim Jacobs. He survives her, along with their daughter, Amanda, of Centreville, Md.         Leaving The Post after several years, Ms. Jacobs decided to write a book about dollhouses and, not long afterward, decided she had better own one. She bought her first from a New Jersey antiques shop in 1945. A derelict post-Civil War sandstone with a mansard roof, it cost $35.         At the time, dollhouses were unfashionable things in the world of collectibles. ''Most antiques dealers didn't even know what I was talking about,'' Ms. Jacobs told The Washington Times in 1999. ''One thought I was looking for doghouses.''         As her collection grew, friends clamored to see it. So did friends of friends. Brownie troops trooped through. Eventually, Ms. Jacobs's houses outgrew Ms. Jacobs's house. She rented a small building in northwest Washington, and the museum was born.         Comprising about 40 dollhouses from the 18th to the early 20th centuries, the museum's collection focused on Victoriana. The star attraction was the multistory Mexican villa, built circa 1890. Besides the chapel, it had roof gardens, an aviary, a working elevator and a gated driveway with a vintage Paige touring car.         Among the other miniature buildings on display were a dentist's office, a milliner's shop and a seaside hotel. There was a tiny circus and a tableau of Teddy Roosevelt on safari in Africa that featured porters, a naturalist and a menagerie that, somewhat incongruously, included a kangaroo.         Ms. Jacobs, who lectured throughout the world on dollhouse history, also wrote several children's books inspired by her work, among them ''The Doll House Mystery'' (Coward-McCann, 1958) and ''The Toy Shop Mystery'' (Coward-McCann, 1960).         In May 2004, the contents of the museum were sold at auction for about $1.4 million. The Mexican villa alone brought $231,000, said Noel Barrett, a dealer in antique toys who handled the sale.         It was hard for Ms. Jacobs to see her dollhouses go, but she had ample consolation at home. There, she had a collection as big as -- by some accounts bigger than -- the one at the museum.       
         Dorothea Towles Church, the first successful black model in Paris, who discovered personal liberation on the runways of Christian Dior and Elsa Schiaparelli in the 1950's, died on July 7 in Manhattan. She was 83.         Her death was confirmed by Michael Henry Adams, a curator at the Museum of the City of New York, where she is among those to be featured in an exhibition called ''Black Style Now,'' opening on Sept. 7.         Ms. Church's success was a historic achievement in an industry that had been especially resistant to using any but white models to represent beauty on magazine covers, advertisements and runways. Ms. Church was responsible for breaking down some of those barriers and was revered in France during the five years she modeled there.         ''If you're beautiful, they don't care what color you are,'' she said of the French, describing her days in the couture salons and nights in postwar Paris.         ''I got invited out all the time,'' she said in Barbara Summers's 1998 book ''Black and Beautiful.'' ''I was the only black model in Europe and I just thought I was an international person.''         Her easy acceptance in Paris was reported back home in black publications, in articles about the designers she knew and how she once dyed her hair platinum at Dior's request.         But her growing fame did not eliminate prejudice on the part of some designers. At Schiaparelli, she once overheard someone describe her as Tahitian. While working for Pierre Balmain, she recalled, he would not allow her to borrow dresses for a photograph for Ebony magazine, fearing that would offend his white clientele. She took the clothes later on the pretext that she would wear them to a party, and the magazine then photographed them. This particular ruse endeared her to young black women with dreams of careers in fashion.         Norma Jean Darden, a former model and an owner of Spoonbread Catering in Manhattan, said: ''When I was 13 years old, I remember reading in Ebony magazine that there was this marvelous woman who had gone to Paris and broken through the color barriers. She was a true inspiration for those who followed fashion.''         Dorothea Towles was born on July 26, 1922, in Texarkana, Tex., the seventh of eight children in a farming family. She studied biology at Wiley College in Marshall, Tex., and planned to go into medicine, but when her mother died, she accepted the invitation of a wealthy uncle to live with him in Los Angeles. She completed a master's degree in education there at the University of Southern California.         In search of a profession, Ms. Church was attracted by the glamour of Los Angeles, so her friends suggested the movies. But there were few roles for black actors, and Ms. Church described herself as more commercially minded. She thought she could succeed in modeling, and enrolled in the Dorothy Farrier Charm and Modeling School as its first black student.         She then found jobs on the West Coast in fashion shows and magazines that catered to black audiences, and a husband, a much older dentist who spoiled her. In 1949, while on a two-month vacation in Paris, where her sister Lois Towles was touring with the concert choir of Fisk University, Ms. Church decided to try modeling there. Dior hired her on the spot to replace one of his regulars, who was on vacation. Ms. Church found that she liked Paris so much that she informed her husband she was staying.         ''He wrote me and even called me, but I told him I wasn't coming back,'' she said. ''He finally got tired, and then he got a lawyer and sued for divorce.''         After a few months, Ms. Church began using her model's discount to buy samples from the designers, piece by piece, until she had assembled several wardrobes' worth of couture gowns that had rarely been seen by American audiences. In 1954, she returned to America by ship, because she had so much luggage, and began a tour of black colleges with her collection. She staged fashion shows and fund-raisers for more than 200 branches of Alpha Kappa Alpha, a college sorority established by black women. Ms. Darden, who was 18 when she met Ms. Church at a benefit show organized by her father for the N.A.A.C.P. in Montclair, N.J., became one of the models in her troupe.         Ms. Church later signed with the Grace del Marco modeling agency in New York, and worked there for several years. She met Thomas Church, a prominent immigration lawyer, shortly after arriving in New York, and they were married in 1963. Mr. Church died in 2000. Ms. Church is survived by their son, Thomas.         ''I feel that my going all over America with my show had a great influence on American black women dressing differently and feeling good about themselves,'' Ms. Church said in ''Black and Beautiful.'' ''I saw them dressing more creatively, more internationally. They could say, 'If she can do it, I can do it, too.' ''         Correction:  July 26, 2006, Wednesday  An obituary on Sunday about Dorothea T. Church, the first successful black model in Paris, gave an outdated date for the opening of an exhibition at the Museum of the City of New York, ''Black Style Now,'' in which she will be featured. It is Sept. 9, not Sept. 7.       
         Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, the German-born soprano whose interpretations of Strauss and Mozart made her one of the most dazzling artists of her time, died yesterday at her home in Austria. She was 90.         Her death was reported by Austrian state television. Citing a funeral home director, the broadcaster, ORF, said Miss Schwarzkopf had died in the town of Schruns in Austria's westernmost province, Vorarlberg. No cause of death was given.         To her legions of admirers, Miss Schwarzkopf was a peerless interpreter of Strauss's Marschallin, Mozart's Donna Elvira and other operatic roles. But her image was tarnished in her later years by revelations that she had lied about the extent of her association with the Nazis during World War II.         Not only had she performed for the Nazis, it was learned, but she had also been a member of the party. In her defense, she said that for an artist needing work, joining the party had been ''akin to joining a union.''         For a singer of such unquestionable stature, Miss Schwarzkopf's work was controversial. In her prime, she possessed a radiant lyric soprano voice, impressive technical agility and exceptional understanding of style. From the 1950's until the 1970's, she was for many listeners the high priestess of the lieder recital, a sublime artist who brought textual nuance, interpretive subtlety and elegant musicianship to her work.         But others found her interpretations calculated, mannered and arch (the ''Prussian perfectionist,'' one critic called her), and complained that in trying to add textual vitality, Miss Schwarzkopf resorted to crooning and half-spoken dramatic effects.         Connoisseurs and critics could be surprisingly divided about her basic vocal gifts.         Will Crutchfield, reviewing some live recordings of Miss Schwarzkopf in recital, wrote in The New York Times in 1990: ''It was always clear that she had a superior voice (a smooth, glamorous lyric soprano) and superior technical command.'' Yet Peter G. Davis, writing in The Times in 1981, described her career as ''a triumph of intelligence and willpower over what was basically an unremarkable voice.''         The consensus, however, was that in roles like the Marschallin and other Strauss heroines (Ariadne in ''Ariadne auf Naxos,'' the countess in ''Capriccio''), as well as Mozart's Fiordiligi and Countess Almaviva and Wagner's Eva and Elsa, she could sing incomparably, with shimmering tone and richness and charismatic presence.         She was an uncommonly beautiful woman, despite a visible gap between her two front teeth that she never bothered to correct, with light hair and deep-set gray eyes. For a time in her younger years she pursued a career as a film actress and might have succeeded had she continued.         A hard-working, self-challenging singer, she performed 74 roles in 53 operas, including Anne Trulove in the world premiere of Stravinsky's ''Rake's Progress'' in Venice in 1951. Her lieder repertory included hundreds of songs by Schubert, Schumann, Mozart and Strauss, and she was a pioneering champion of the songs of Hugo Wolf, which she sang with insight and affecting beauty.         Olga Maria Elisabeth Frederike Schwarzkopf was born on Dec. 9, 1915, in Jarotschin, Germany, in what is now west-central Poland. Both her parents were Prussian. Friedrich Schwarzkopf, her father, a classics schoolmaster, was an easygoing intellectual. Her mother, the former Elisabeth Frohling, was an efficient homemaker who took charge of her adored only child's education and budding musical career.         Friedrich Schwarzkopf's work as a teacher necessitated that the family move several times. When Elisabeth was 13, they settled in Magdeburg, Germany, where she studied piano, guitar, viola and organ and developed a naturally high, light voice that kept her in demand for concerts at school and local amateur performances.         The family moved to Berlin in 1933, the year Hitler came to power. Miss Schwarzkopf attended the Berlin Royal Augusta School and later won admission to the Hochschule f√ºr Musik. In 1934, before beginning her formal training, she won a grant from the League of National Socialist Students for a cycling and camping trip to England, where she learned English. She retained a fondness for the country, which after the war embraced her as an artist and made her a Dame of the British Empire in 1992.         At the music school, students were required to attend daily lectures on Hitler's National Socialist movement, and in 1935, when she was nearly 20, Miss Schwarzkopf joined the student association of the National Socialist Party. Alan Jefferson, a Schwarzkopf biographer, said she became f√ºhrerin of the student organization and that one of her responsibilities as ideological leader was to ''keep an eye on other students.''         Her teacher at the Hochschule f√ºr Musik, Lula Mysz-Gmeiner, though distinguished in her field, inexplicably believed that Miss Schwarzkopf should be a contralto. It was not until after her formal training, in 1938, when she began singing with the Berlin State Opera, that Miss Schwarzkopf came into her own vocally.         During this time she gained a reputation as a singer fiercely determined to leap from the small roles typically assigned a newcomer into substantive parts. The director of the company, Wilhelm Rode, had won the favor of Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda minister. One reason Miss Schwarzkopf later gave for cooperating with the Nazis was that it was incumbent on aspiring singers in the company to support the party.         But until the 1980's, she maintained that she had never officially joined the Nazi Party. She denied having done so in three Allied questionnaires in 1945, a time during the occupation when former party members were usually barred from public performance in Germany.         In 1982, however, a music historian at the University of Vienna, Oliver Rathkolb, published a doctoral dissertation that revealed details of her party membership. The information had come from documents discovered in the Allied Denazification Bureau in Vienna and subsequently moved to the National Archives in Washington.         According to these records, Miss Schwarzkopf applied for membership on Jan. 26, 1940, and was accepted on March 1 of that year, becoming Nazi member No. 7548960. Scholars and authors have since placed her application for party membership even earlier.         In an interview with The Times in 1983, Miss Schwarzkopf denied she had been a party member. But when told of these documents by The Times, she admitted that she had joined the party. ''We thought nothing of it,'' she said. ''We just did it.'' In a letter to The Times, she expanded on her explanation: ''It was akin to joining a union, and exactly for the same reason: to have a job.''         In other interviews, she quoted in her defense the first line of Tosca's famous aria: ''Vissi d'arte,'' which translates, ''I lived for art.''         Discussion of her Nazi past re-emerged briefly in connection with tributes to her on her 80th birthday. Mr. Jefferson's biography, ''Elisabeth Schwarzkopf,'' which came out at the time, raised debate about her wartime role, depicting her as an ambitious singer who was focused on furthering her career.         As a Nazi, Miss Schwarzkopf gave performances at party functions and sang for Waffen SS troops at the front. Some researchers believe she became a member of Goebbels's Reichstheaterkammer, working in the propaganda ministry and appearing insome films.         Still, if she had hoped that party affiliation would quickly advance her career at the Berlin State Opera, it did not work as planned. She was still expected to sing, sometimes nightly, bit roles in ''Carmen,'' ''Die Fledermaus'' and frothy operettas.         Her breakthrough came with the dauntingly difficult coloratura role of Zerbinetta in ''Ariadne auf Naxos,'' which she first sang in late 1940. Her performance won the attention of Maria Ivog√ºn, a noted exponent of the role. Miss Ivog√ºn was so impressed, she took on Miss Schwarzkopf as a private student, coaching her in the high soprano repertory, and training her as a lieder singer. Miss Schwarzkopf was soon engaged by the Vienna State Opera.         She realized that her future lay with the lyric soprano repertory. Engagements followed at the first postwar Salzburg Festival in 1947, where she worked with the conductor Wilhelm Furtw√§ngler, and in subsequent summers, when she formed a close working relationship with the conductor Herbert von Karajan. She also toured with the Vienna State Opera in 1947, traveling to London, where she performed in ''Don Giovanni'' and ''Fidelio'' at Covent Garden.         The London performances were an enormous success, and she was invited to join the newly founded Covent Garden company. She sang with the company for the next five years, performing not just her German repertory but also Violetta, Mimi, Gilda, and Massenet's Manon, all in English.         Her career and repertory choices were now being shaped by Walter Legge, then a music administrator and critic. Born in London in 1906, Legge had no formal training in music but was musically astute. He had been an assistant to Sir Thomas Beecham and was largely responsible for forming the Philharmonia Orchestra and Chorus.         After the war, Legge worked mainly for recording companies. It was during a scouting trip to Vienna in search of new talent for EMI Records that the severe-looking, bespectacled Legge first heard Miss Schwarzkopf in an audition. Thus began an artistic partnership that grew into a life partnership. Legge, then divorced from his first wife, Nancy Evans, a mezzo-soprano, married Miss Schwarzkopf in 1953.         Opinion is divided about the effect Legge had on Miss Schwarzkopf as an artist. He tended to treat her as a musical and intellectual inferior. He was capable of berating her in public when she failed to meet his approval.         But he introduced her to a wealth of repertory, especially the songs of Hugo Wolf, and as artistic director of EMI Records, he supervised her recordings, coaching her in detail and ensuring that the engineers captured her voice at its best. Given Miss Schwarzkopf's association with the Nazis, there was some trepidation about launching her American career. Her debut in the United States was delayed until October 1953, but that performance, a single sold-out song recital at Town Hall in New York, captivated the critics.         This was followed in late 1954 by an American tour, which ended back at Town Hall. A critic for Musical America wrote that Miss Schwarzkopf's singing at Town Hall had ''displayed the exquisite finish, technical mastery and interpretive felicity that had marked her debut recital here last season.''         In the fall of 1956 she sang a recital at Carnegie Hall. It was the first time the hall had ever been sold out for a program of German lieder.         Miss Schwarzkopf's American operatic debut came in 1955 with the San Francisco Opera as the Marschallin. Mildred Norton, a critic for The Saturday Review, reported that a capacity audience had saluted a ''memorable new Princess Werdenberg.'' Miss Schwarzkopf, she wrote, was ''a poised and vibrant new personality with a vocal radiance and a personal grace.''         Her debut at the Metropolitan Opera did not occur until October 1964, again as the Marschallin. Though Raymond Erickson, a critic for The Times, noted less freshness and bloom in Miss Schwarzkopf's voice (she was nearly 49), he said she had ''conquered her listeners, and the roar that filled the house when she took her bows must be the kind that the most vain prima donna could ask for.''         Outside the Metropolitan Opera House, there were scattered protests over her wartime career, and Miss Schwarzkopf had a chilly relationship with the Met's general manager Rudolf Bing, an Austrian-born Jew. Besides her six performances of the Marschallin that debut season, she sang only one more time at the Met, a Donna Elvira in 1966.         But she performed frequently in New York in recital and with orchestras and continued to win devoted admirers around the world. Many of her EMI recordings became immediate classics. Among them were her Mozart song album with the pianist Walter Gieseking and her Schubert song album with the pianist Edwin Fischer, both recorded in 1952; her 1957 recording of ''Rosenkavalier,'' conducted by Karajan, and, one of her finest achievements, her 1959 recording of ''Capriccio,'' conducted by Wolfgang Sawallisch.         As her career slowed, she began giving master classes, usually teaming with Legge, gaining a reputation as an insightful but almost impossibly exacting coach. In 1977-78, she embarked on a swan song recital tour, mostly accompanied by the pianist Geoffrey Parsons, who was her partner for her official farewell recital in Zurich on March 19, 1979. Two days later, Legge, who had become embittered that his talents were no longer sought by recording companies, died of a heart attack at 72.         Miss Schwarzkopf leaves no immediate survivors. Asked once whether she regretted having had no children, she replied, ''I have 500 children, the songs I sing.''         Correction:  August 5, 2006, Saturday  A photograph with an obituary yesterday about the renowned soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf, who died Thursday in Austria at age 90, was published in error. The picture, supplied by the Salzburg Festival, showed Anneliese Rothenberger, not Miss Schwarzkopf, in the role of Sophie from a 1962 film adaptation of Richard Strauss's opera ''Der Rosenkavalier.'' Miss Schwarzkopf played the Marschallin in that production, which the festival had staged for the film. The Marschallin was a signature role for Miss Schwarzkopf, who performed it, above, in 1959 at Covent Garden in London.         (Photo by Evening Standard/Getty Images)         Correction:  August 5, 2006, Saturday  A picture yesterday with an obituary of the soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf was published in error. It showed Anneliese Rothenberger -- not Miss Schwarzkopf -- in the role of Sophie from ''Der Rosenkavalier,'' a 1962 film adaptation of the Richard Strauss opera. The Salzburg Festival mounted that production, in which Miss Schwarzkopf had the role of the Marschallin, and originally distributed the photograph with the incorrect information. A picture of Miss Schwarzkopf appears today on Page C10.         The obituary also misspelled the surname of a music critic for The New York Times who reviewed Miss Schwarzkopf's debut at the Metropolitan Opera in 1964. He was Raymond Ericson, not Erickson.         Correction:  August 10, 2006, Thursday  An obituary on Friday of the soprano Elisabeth Schwarzkopf referred incorrectly to her birthplace in some copies. When she was born in 1915, the town was Jarotschin, Germany, not Jarocin, and it was not ''near Poland;'' Poland did not exist then as an independent nation. Since 1918 the town has been Jarocin, Poland.       
         Susan Butcher, a pioneer for women in sled-dog racing who won the Iditarod race four times and influenced the training and treatment of dogs in the sport, died Saturday at a hospital in Seattle. She was 51.         The cause was leukemia, said Dr. Jan Abkowitz, the lead physician who treated Butcher at the University of Washington Medical Center.         Butcher was the second woman to win the Iditarod, the annual 1,150-mile race from Anchorage to Nome, but the first to dominate the grueling competition through the Alaskan wilderness. She won three years in a row, from 1986 to 1988, and again in 1990 before retiring from competition to raise a family with her husband and fellow musher, David Monson, in the mid-1990's.         Among her many achievements, Butcher was the first to summit Mount McKinley, North America's highest peak, with a dog team in 1979.         ''She never thought there should be any barriers for women,'' Monson said in a telephone interview yesterday. ''She was the first woman ever to dominate and be the best in the world at a sport where men and women compete equally, and the men did not like that.         ''I don't think she ever thought of herself as a pioneer.''         Born and reared in Cambridge, Mass., before studying at Colorado State University and moving to Alaska, Butcher finished in the top five in 12 of her 17 attempts at the Iditarod from 1978 to 1994. Her success brought unprecedented attention to the race.         ''If you knew Susan, you knew that she was a tremendous competitor, but she had this ability to connect with people that helped this race and this sport rise to a level it had never been at before,'' Chas St. George, spokesman for the Iditarod, said in a telephone interview.         Butcher's careful training and treatment of her dogs revolutionized the sport. She went on to raise and train dogs with her husband at Trail Breakers Kennel near Fairbanks, Alaska.         ''In a lot of respects, her greatest contribution to the sport itself was how she made year-round care and training really the standard rather than the exception,'' Monson said.         Butcher had been treated for polycythemia vera, a blood-system disorder. She was found to have acute leukemia in December 2005, and was treated with chemotherapy. With the cancer in remission, she had a stem-cell transplant on May 16 and chose an experimental approach to maximize her chance for a cure.         ''There's no question she was a fighter, and she always chose to take risks for the hope she could be cured,'' Dr. Abkowitz, of the University of Washington Medical Center and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, said in a telephone interview.         Butcher was hospitalized again June 28 with graft-versus-host disease, a complication of the transplant as the injected cells attacked her digestive tract.         On July 25, the leukemia recurred and was especially aggressive, and Butcher received additional chemotherapy.         The news of her death sent more shock waves through the tight community of mushers.         ''We knew the odds were not in her favor,'' Martin Buser, a four-time Iditarod champion, said in a telephone interview. ''You keep thinking an ultracompetitor like that will pull through. You also realize the numbers might be stacked against her.''         Monson said his wife had her last extended talk with their two daughters, 11-year-old Tekla and 6-year-old Chisana, shortly before having another round of chemotherapy in hopes of beating the illness.         ''She knew that her kids, her girls were going to be powerful, confident young women someday,'' Monson said. ''She lived more in 51 years than some people do in 100.''       
         Oriana Fallaci, a dissecting interviewer of the powerful and an iconoclastic journalist who became an icon herself, died Friday in her home city of Florence, Italy. She was 77.         Ms. Fallaci, who also had a home in Manhattan, was known to have suffered from cancer for the last decade. Paolo Klun, an official with the RCS publishing group, which carried Ms. Fallaci's work, told The Associated Press that Ms. Fallaci had gone back to Florence days ago as her condition worsened and that she had died at a private hospital there.         Known in recent years for writing angrily against Islam, Ms. Fallaci became famous in the 1960's and 70's for her war journalism and her long, aggressive and revealing interviews with prominent people. She was once described in The Los Angeles Times as ''the journalist to whom virtually no world figure would say no.'' Among her subjects were Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the father of the Iranian revolution; Yasir Arafat, the Palestinian leader; Golda Meir, the Israeli prime minister; Indira Gandhi, the longstanding Indian prime minister; Nguyen Van Thieu, the South Vietnamese president during the war years; and Henry Kissinger, President Richard M. Nixon's secretary of state.         Mr. Kissinger called his experience with Ms. Fallaci ''the most disastrous conversation I ever had with any member of the press.'' At the height of his power and celebrity in 1972, she had coaxed him to admit that at times he felt like ''the cowboy who leads the wagon train by riding ahead alone on his horse, the cowboy who rides all alone into the town.'' Mr. Kissinger later wrote in his memoirs that the quotation harmed his relations with Nixon.         A glamorous figure with high cheekbones, a black curl of eyeliner and an ever-present cigarette, she believed that she had the right to ask or say anything, and did so in writings translated into more than 20 languages. In interviews she could be in turn incisive, flattering and blunt, taking her subjects by surprise.         ''How do you swim in a chador?'' she asked Ayatollah Khomeini in 1979, not long after he came to power in Iran. His reply, she wrote in The New York Times, was that she was not obliged to wear one, because it was a garment for proper Islamic women. She tore off her chador, and Ayatollah Khomeini stalked off.         Her boldness earned her a new generation of admirers -- and many detractors -- after the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, prompted her to end years of silence with warnings about Islam. In three books beginning with ''The Rage and the Pride'' (Rizzoli, 2002) and in many interviews, she sharply criticized not only Islamic extremists but also Islam itself. She accused the West of having become too complacent and tolerant to understand the threat she believed Islam presented.         The ''sons of Allah breed like rats,'' she wrote, condemning the growing immigration of Muslims in Europe, including her homeland.         ''Europe is no longer Europe,'' she told The Wall Street Journal in 2005. ''It is 'Eurabia,' a colony of Islam, where the Islamic invasion does not proceed only in a physical sense, but also in a mental and cultural sense. Servility to the invaders has poisoned democracy, with obvious consequences for the freedom of thought, and for the concept itself of liberty.''         Her warnings endeared her to many conservatives and won her, a lifelong atheist, an audience with Pope Benedict XVI in 2005. But she was also accused of racism, and in Switzerland and Italy she was charged with violating laws against vilifying religion. In 2003, the left-wing Italian newspaper La Repubblica called her an ''exhibitionist posing as the Joan of Arc of the West.''         Born June 29, 1929, in Florence, she was made a lookout for the Italian Resistance at the age of 10 by her antifascist father, Edoardo, a cabinet maker. The early brush with danger became a pattern.         As a journalist, she covered wars from Vietnam to Central Asia to South America. In Mexico City in 1968, days before the Summer Olympics were to begin there, she was shot three times, dragged down steps by the hair by soldiers and left for dead in clashes in which several hundred protesters were killed.         ''Alas, nothing reveals man the way war does,'' she told an interviewer in 2001. ''Nothing so accentuates in him the beauty and ugliness, the intelligence and foolishness, the brutishness and humanity, the courage and cowardice, the enigma.''         But it was her interviews that made her famous and her books staples on college campuses around the world. Never married, she fell in love with one of her subjects, the Greek poet and activist Alekos Panagoulis, who was convicted of trying to assassinate Greece's military ruler, George Papadapoulos, in 1967. Mr. Panagoulis was killed in 1976 in a car crash that Ms. Fallaci maintained was an assassination. Her novel ''A Man'' was a barely concealed story of his life.         Her other books included a collection of her interviews, ''Interview with History'' (1976); ''If the Sun Dies'' (1966), about the American space program; ''Letter to a Child Unborn'' (1976), a novel about a single woman's conversation with a child she aborted; and ''The Force of Reason'' (2006), on Islam, Europe and the angry reaction to her post-Sept. 11 book ''The Rage and the Pride.''         In recent years she was a private and solitary figure, working out of her townhouse on the Upper East Side of Manhattan and visiting Florence and a house she owns in Tuscany. She is survived by a sister, Paola, who was with her when she died, Italian news reports said.         For a woman who relentlessly prodded her interview subjects into self revelation, Ms. Fallaci said she did not like to talk about herself.         ''To speak of oneself means to lay bare one's own soul, expose it like a body to the sun,'' she told an interviewer in 1979. ''To lay bare one's own soul is not at all like taking off one's brassiere on a crowded beach!''         Correction:  September 21, 2006, Thursday  An obituary on Saturday about the iconoclastic Italian journalist Oriana Fallaci misstated the title of one of her books and its publication date, and described incorrectly an element of the plot. The English title of the book is "Letter to a Child Never Born," not "Letter to a Child Unborn." It was published in 1975, not 1976, and it is about a single woman's conversation with a child that she ultimately miscarried, not aborted.       
         Beth Levine, an innovative American shoe designer whose boots, as Nancy Sinatra sang while wearing them, were made for walking, died on Wednesday night at her home in Manhattan. She was 91.         The cause was lung cancer, said her niece, Nan Bush, the wife and producing partner of the photographer Bruce Weber.         Mrs. Levine designed shoes for 30 years under the label Herbert Levine, named for her husband, and was known as America's First Lady of Shoe Design because of her prominence in 20th-century fashion, and because her designs were worn by the American first ladies Lady Bird Johnson, Patricia Nixon and Jacqueline Kennedy.         She made shoes for Barbra Streisand in ''Funny Girl'' and the white stiletto boots worn by Nancy Sinatra to sing ''These Boots Are Made For Walkin'.'' Mrs. Levine had reignited a trend for boots in the 1960's with her stretchy stocking styles and vinyl Go-Go boots, designed for dancing, (or walking all over you). When Ms. Sinatra released her anthem of women's empowerment in 1966, she was shown in film made for early video jukeboxes wearing the style from Herbert Levine. The song increased the demand for fashion boots so much that Saks Fifth Avenue opened a corner in its shoe department called Beth's Bootery.         ''She was among the most influential shoe designers of the century,'' said Elizabeth Semmelhack, the chief curator of the Bata Shoe Museum in Toronto, who included Mrs. Levine in an exhibition this year called ''Icons of Elegance.''         ''In looking at 20th-century shoe design, she was in many ways a maverick mind,'' Ms. Semmelhack said. ''She saw the possibilities in all sorts of new materials and different ways of making a shoe.''         Mrs. Levine's designs were known for their poetic whimsy: She lined a sandal with an insole of Astroturf and affixed a plastic flower to its toe straps, and she designed heels made of rolled leather or silver thread that looked like a spool.         One of Mrs. Levine's most fanciful ideas, though it did not catch on, was the ''upper-less shoe,'' which was merely the sole of a high-heeled shoe with an adhesive insole that attached to the bottom of the foot. Her most outrageous designs -- driving shoes made to look like race cars, elaborately carved wooden blocks that looked like birds in flight and evening shoes that looked like Aladdin's lamp -- were included in an exhibition at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1976, when she and her husband retired.         Beth Katz Levine was born on Dec. 31, 1914, in Patchogue, N.Y., the third of five children of Anna and Israel Katz, Lithuanian immigrants who operated a dairy farm. In the 1930's, she moved to Manhattan and found work as a shoe model (her feet were size 4B), then worked her way up from a stylist to head designer for I. Miller.         After working for the Red Cross in World War II, she applied for a job in 1944 designing shoes for another shoe manufacturer. She met Herbert Levine, who was running that company, and married him three months later.         Mr. Levine died in 1991. Mrs. Levine is survived by a daughter, Anna Thomson-Wilson, of Manhattan.         Mrs. Levine once said: ''My mother always thought a fine pair of shoes was a necessity. And my father dealt with horses and cows, so I knew about leather.''         In 1948, the couple started a business under the name Herbert Levine. Mrs. Levine wrote in a letter to the Bata Shoe Museum this year: ''We wanted to create a shoemaking niche. We were making very pretty shoes that nobody needed, but everybody wanted.''         Mrs. Levine was given the Coty Award in 1967, for design innovations that overcame traditional boundaries of footwear. In the 1950's, European designers had created a demand for mules, but they were difficult for women to walk in without crunching their toes to keep them on. Mrs. Levine's solution was a strip of elastic that caused the heel of the mule to flip upward as a woman walked, maintaining the tension between the ball of the foot and the heel. She called her invention the Spring-O-Later.         ''Clothes designers have gravity on their side,'' Mrs. Levine said. ''But shoe designers work upside down. Ideas are easy to come by. Getting them realized is something else.''         Although she worked closely with fashion designers to create shoes that would match their clothes, including a regular collaboration with James Galanos, Mrs. Levine was often a vocal critic of their work. Even after her retirement, she would call the designer Helmut Lang after his show to tell him what she liked and what she did not.         Ms. Bush once recalled introducing her aunt to Gianni Versace at a restaurant. ''The first thing she said was: 'You should be ashamed of yourself. Some of those clothes you make are really degrading to women,' '' Ms. Bush said. ''But by the end of the night, they were friends.''       
         H√©l√®ne Deschamps Adams, who as a teenager in France defied death by spying for groups resisting Nazi occupiers and their collaborators, and later for the United States, died on Sept. 16 in Manhattan. She was 85.         The cause was congestive heart failure, said her daughter, Karyn Anick Monget, who noted that her mother had a variety of maladies, including pneumonia.         H√©l√®ne Deschamps came from a military family, was a tomboy and hated the thought of the Nazis' taking over her country. This combination propelled her to volunteer to fight with the French Resistance. Her youthful looks, insouciance and an accent German soldiers found delightful helped provide cover.         She reported on airfield locations, German mines and antiaircraft and camouflaged emplacements along the shores of the Mediterranean. She saved American parachutists from capture at drop zones and helped Jewish families escape to Spain.         ''H√©l√®ne was a very gutsy young woman,'' Henry Hyde, the chief of American intelligence in France during World War II, said in an interview in ''Women in the Resistance'' by Margaret L. Rossiter (Praeger, 1985). ''She went through the lines for us, observing German defense installations and order of battle,'' he said. ''She took many risks and was a genuinely good operator.''         She was captured by resistance fighters from another resistance group while carrying fake German papers and was almost executed. A close friend she regarded as a sister, whom she had recruited to spy with her, was killed by a sniper while she was in the back seat of a car driven by Ms. Deschamps, who then quickly had to dig the grave.         She hid in a closet full of apples while drunken Germans tormented her French protectors. She watched in silent terror as Nazi soldiers brutalized a pregnant woman at a roadside.         In an interview with CNN in 1996, Mrs. Deschamps Adams said her years of espionage had ''no glamour, no romance, no dinner at the embassy in a designer gown.''         There was only a necessary job, she said. ''You have to forget your own feelings.''         Gratitude was never plentiful. Mrs. Deschamps Adams's daughter said her mother never got the pension that she said had been promised by someone in the Office of Strategic Services, the wartime spy agency that was the C.I.A.'s precursor. She got no awards from governments until 2000, when the United States gave her the Distinguished Service Medal and France recognized her heroism in a joint ceremony.         She did find love on the battlefield. After a whirlwind weekend with an American first lieutenant, Forest E. Adams, whom she met while he was on furlough, she accepted his marriage proposal and came to the United States with him in 1946. Their daughter said neither knew much of the other's language, but shared what her mother called ''the language of love.''         Mr. Adams died of a heart attack in 1951, and Mrs. Deschamps Adams never remarried. Karyn, a baby at the time of her father's death, said her mother told her she never met a man as good as the one she lost.         In addition to her daughter, who lives in Manhattan, Mrs. Deschamps Adams is survived by a brother, Henri Deschamps of Maraussan, France.         H√©l√®ne Marguerite Deschamps was born on Jan. 30, 1921, in the French concession of what was then called Tientsin, China, and was raised in Senegal, Madagascar and R√©union, an island department of France in the Indian Ocean. Her father, a general in the French colonial army, retired to Aix-en-Provence, in the south of France, in the late 1930's.         She was studying in a convent when Hitler invaded France in 1940. The advice of her mentor, a French colonel who had been a friend of her father's, was to ''join the Red Cross or something,'' not the underground.         She had no special training when she and the friend she recruited began riding their bicycles to spy on German troops -- some of whom gallantly helped with bike repairs.         She was given the code name Anick and posed as a secretary at the headquarters of the Milice, the special police force known as the French Gestapo. She stole the records of people marked for execution, including Jews and resistance fighters, and stuffed them in her brassiere, her daughter said, then flushed them down the toilet.         She suffered a permanent back injury when she was beaten by a French interrogator, and was partly deaf because she walked into a building where she knew a bomb had been planted, and it went off just as she was leaving.         When she became disillusioned with the resistance because so many anti-Nazi groups were competing against one another, a resistance leader arranged for her to meet an O.S.S. agent, who accepted her on the strength of the leader's word.         After her husband's death, Mrs. Deschamps Adams worked on a Lockheed assembly line and then taught French in many places, including Iran, Hawaii, Germany and Bermuda. She wrote two memoirs, ''The Secret War'' (W. H. Allen, 1980) and ''Spyglass: An Autobiography'' (Henry Holt, 1995).         In the introduction to ''Spyglass,'' she asked a question: ''If you had to renounce family, friends, any kind of a normal lifestyle to fight a fierce enemy, would you?''       
         Former Representative Helen P. Chenoweth-Hage of Idaho, an archconservative who ridiculed the Endangered Species Act and the protection of salmon in her own state and called for disbanding large parts of the federal government, died on Monday in a car accident in Nevada. She was 68.         Rocky Gonzalez, a spokesman for the Nevada Highway Patrol, said Mrs. Chenoweth-Hage, a passenger in a sport utility vehicle, died when it overturned on a remote northern Nevada highway about an hour's drive from her ranch in Monitor Valley, Nev., where she had moved five years ago.         She was traveling with her daughter-in-law, Yelena Hage, and Ms. Hage's 5-month-old son, Bryan Hage, who survived with minor injuries.         Mrs. Chenoweth-Hage was elected in 1994 as part of the Republican takeover of the House and served three terms, from 1995 to 2001, representing Idaho's First Congressional District.         She said she did not condone violence against the federal government, which militias and racial separatists in her largely rural district called for, but she had a reputation as a sagebrush rebel who sometimes sympathized with their causes.         She said she thought that the federal government asserted too much claim to Western land and resources and intruded on personal liberties. In a 1996 interview with The New York Times, she declared support for the South's position in the Civil War, as a ''state's rights issue.'' But she said she opposed slavery and would distance herself from racist groups and militias that regularly hailed her.         Mrs. Chenoweth-Hage received national attention for mocking the Endangered Species Act, saying it applied to white males, and, during her first campaign, in 1994, holding what she called endangered-salmon bakes. She served canned salmon and complained about the presence of Idaho salmon on the endangered species list.         Her suspicion of the federal government led her to advocate the elimination of the Education, Energy, Commerce and Housing Departments, and she accused Fish and Wildlife agents of harassing ranchers with helicopters. She later conceded she had little evidence of that.         As much as liberals and environmentalists loathed her -- ''Can Helen, Not Salmon'' went one bumper sticker -- supporters admired what they considered a principled, call-it-as-I-see-it manner.         She was born Helen Palmer in Topeka, Kan., on Jan. 27, 1938, grew up in Grants Pass, Ore., and attended Whitworth College in Spokane, Wash., before moving to the northern Idaho town of Orofino.         While at Whitworth, she met and married Nick Chenoweth, and they had two children, Mike and Meg Chenoweth-Keenan, of Boise, Idaho, who survive her, along with several grandchildren.         The couple divorced in 1975, and Mrs. Chenoweth moved to Boise, becoming active in politics and serving for a time as executive director of the Idaho Republican Party and then as chief of staff to Representative Steven D. Symms.         She scored an upset in the 1994 Republican primary over David H. Leroy, a former state attorney general, and went on to defeat the Democratic incumbent.         In 1999, she married Wayne Hage Sr., a Nevada rancher prominent in the movement to expand private property rights. He died in June.         Mrs. Chenoweth-Hage left office fulfilling a promise, in the spirit of the Contract With America's call for term limits, not to serve more than three terms.       
         Florence Klotz, who won six Tony Awards for designing some of the most memorable costumes in recent Broadway history, died Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 86.         The cause was heart failure, said her lawyer, Mark Sendroff.         With a flair for period dress and an obsession with detail and authenticity, Ms. Klotz created outfits that ranged from the opulent beaded showgirl costumes of ''Follies'' to the ornate 19th century Japanese robes of ''Pacific Overtures'' to the slinky, webbed dress that Chita Rivera wore in ''Kiss of the Spider Woman.''         Though she designed the costumes for successful plays like ''Take Her, She's Mine,'' ''The Owl and the Pussycat'' and the 1981 revival of ''Little Foxes'' starring Elizabeth Taylor and Maureen Stapleton, Ms. Klotz preferred musicals.         Her most fruitful and rewarding collaboration was with the director Harold Prince. They first worked together on the short-lived 1961 play ''A Call on Kuprin,'' which Mr. Prince produced and George Abbott directed. Ms. Klotz's breakthrough came in 1971 with the Stephen Sondheim musical ''Follies,'' which Mr. Prince directed and produced.         With the ghostly shadows of the Ziegfeld era as the musical's backdrop, Ms. Klotz created a surreal tableau of three-foot-high ostrich feather headdresses, Marie Antoinette wigs adorned with musical instruments and birdcages and gowns embellished with translucent butterfly wings.         Clive Barnes, writing in The New York Times, called Ms. Klotz's designs ''the best costumes to be seen on Broadway.'' She won a Tony Award later that year.         ''Follies'' was only the start of her success with Prince-directed shows: she went on to win Tony Awards for her designs in ''A Little Night Music'' (1973), ''Pacific Overtures'' (1976), ''Grind'' (1985), ''Kiss of the Spider Woman'' (1993) and the 1994 revival of ''Show Boat.''         ''That had 585 costumes,'' she said of the ''Show Boat'' revival in an interview with the Theatermania.com Web site in 2002. ''The time period ranged from 1896 to 1926, so I had to do a lot of research. I don't know how they could afford to do a show like that; the laundry bill alone must have been astronomical.''         Ms. Klotz, a petite but forceful woman who was known as Flossie to her friends, also had a friendly relationship with Ms. Taylor. In addition to working with her on the 1977 film version of ''A Little Night Music''--for which Ms. Klotz was nominated for an Academy Award -- Ms. Taylor asked Ms. Klotz to design the lavender dress she wore for her wedding to Senator John Warner in 1976.         Ms. Klotz was born in Brooklyn on October 28, 1920. After graduating from Parsons School of Design, Ms. Klotz went to work painting fabrics for Brooks Costumes. In 1951, Irene Sharaff asked her to assist on the costume designs for the original production of ''The King and I,'' and Ms. Klotz's design career took off.         ''I thought it was so glamorous,'' she recalled in a 1981 interview with The Washington Post. ''I didn't smell the greasepaint, but I was hooked.''         Ms. Klotz is survived by her niece, Suzanne DeMarco; her companion, the producer and stage manager Ruth Mitchell, died in 2000.         Correction:  November 4, 2006, Saturday  A picture caption yesterday with an obituary about a Broadway costume designer who won six Tony Awards misstated her surname at one point. She was Florence Klotz, not Katz.       
         Ruth Brown, the gutsy rhythm and blues singer whose career extended to acting and crusading for musicians' rights, died yesterday in Las Vegas. She was 78 and lived in Las Vegas.         The cause was complications following a heart attack and a stroke she suffered after surgery, and Ms. Brown had been on life support since Oct. 29, said her friend, lawyer and executor, Howell Begle.         ''She was one of the original divas,'' said the singer Bonnie Raitt, who worked with Ms. Brown and Mr. Begle to improve royalties for rhythm and blues performers. ''I can't really say that I've heard anyone that sounds like Ruth, before or after. She was a combination of sass and innocence, and she was extremely funky. She could really put it right on the beat, and the tone of her voice was just mighty. And she had a great heart.''         ''What I loved about her,'' Ms. Raitt added, ''was her combination of vulnerability and resilience and fighting spirit. It was not arrogance, but she was just really not going to lay down and roll over for anyone.''         Ms. Brown sustained a career for six decades: first as a bright, bluesy singer who was called ''the girl with a tear in her voice'' and then, after some lean years, as the embodiment of an earthy, indomitable black woman. She had a life of hard work, hard luck, determination, audacity and style. Sometimes it was said that R&B stood as much for Ruth Brown as it did for rhythm and blues.         As the 1950s began, Ms. Brown's singles for the fledgling Atlantic Records -- like ''(Mama) He Treats Your Daughter Mean'' and ''5-10-15 Hours'' -- became both the label's bankroll and templates for all of rock 'n' roll. She could sound as if she were hurting, or joyfully lusty, or both at once. Her voice was forthright, feisty and ready for anything.         After Ms. Brown's string of hits ended, she kept singing but also went on to a career in television, radio and movies ( including a memorable role as the disc jockey Motormouth Maybelle in John Waters's ''Hairspray'') and on Broadway, where she won a Tony Award for her part in ''Black and Blue.'' She worked clubs, concerts and festivals into the 21st century.         ''Whatever I have to say, I get it said,'' she said in an interview with The New York Times in 1995. ''Like the old spirituals say, 'I've gone too far to turn me 'round now.' ''         Ms. Brown was born Ruth Weston on Jan. 12, 1928, in Portsmouth, Va., the oldest of seven children. She made her debut when she was 4, and her father, the choir director at the local Emmanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church, lifted her onto the church piano. In summers, she and her siblings picked cotton at her grandmother's farm in North Carolina. ''That made me the strong woman I am,'' she said in 1995.         As a teenager, she would tell her family she was going to choir practice and perform instead at U.S.O. clubs at nearby naval stations. She ran away from home at 17, working with a trumpeter named Jimmy Brown and using his last name onstage. She married him, or thought she did; he was already married. But she was making a reputation as Ruth Brown, and the name stuck.         The big-band leader Lucky Millinder heard her in Detroit late in 1946, hired her for his band and fired her in Washington, D.C. . Stranded, she managed to find a club engagement at the Crystal Caverns. There, the disc jockey Willis Conover, who broadcast jazz internationally on Voice of America radio, heard Ms. Brown and recommended her to friends at Atlantic Records.         On the way to New York City, however, she was seriously injured in an automobile accident and hospitalized for most of a year; her legs, which were smashed, would be painful for the rest of her life. She stood on crutches in 1949 to record her first session for Atlantic, and the bluesy ballad ''So Long'' became a hit.         She wanted to keep singing ballads, but Atlantic pushed her to try upbeat songs, and she tore into them. During the sessions for ''Teardrops From My Eyes,'' her voice cracked upward to a squeal. Herb Abramson of Atlantic Records liked it, called it a ''tear,'' and after ''Teardrops'' reached No. 1 on the rhythm and blues chart, the sound became her trademark for a string of hits.         ''If I was getting ready to go and record and I had a bad throat, they'd say, 'Good!','' she once recalled.         Ms. Brown was the best-selling black female performer of the early 1950s, even though, in that segregated era, many of her songs were picked up and redone by white singers, like Patti Page and Georgia Gibbs, in tamer versions that became pop hits. The pop singer Frankie Laine gave her a lasting nickname: Miss Rhythm.         Working the rhythm and blues circuit in the 1950s, when dozens of her singles reached the R&B Top 10, Ms. Brown drove a Cadillac and had romances with stars like the saxophonist Willis (Gator Tail) Jackson and the singer Clyde McPhatter of the Drifters. (Her first son, Ronald, was given the last name Jackson; decades later, she told him he was actually Mr. McPhatter's son, and he now sings with a latter-day lineup of the Drifters.)         In 1955 Ms. Brown married Earl Swanson, a saxophonist, and had a second son, Earl; the marriage ended in divorce. Her two sons survive her: Mr. Jackson, who has three children, of Los Angeles, and Mr. Swanson of Las Vegas. She is also survived by four siblings: Delia Weston of Las Vegas, Leonard Weston of Long Island and Alvin and Benjamin Weston of Portsmouth.         Her streak of hits ended soon after the 1960s began. She lived on Long Island, raised her sons, worked as a teacher's aide and a maid and was married for three years to a police officer, Bill Blunt. On weekends she sang club dates in the New York area, and she recorded an album in 1968 with the Thad Jones-Mel Lewis Big Band. Although her hits had supported Atlantic Records -- sometimes called the House That Ruth Built -- she was unable at one point to afford a home telephone.         The comedian Redd Foxx, whom she had once helped out of a financial jam, invited her to Los Angeles in 1975 to play the gospel singer Mahalia Jackson in ''Selma,'' a musical about civil rights he was producing.         She went on to sing in Las Vegas and continued a comeback that never ended. The television producer Norman Lear gave her a role in the sitcom ''Hello, Larry.'' She returned to New York City in 1982, appearing in Off Broadway productions including ''Stagger Lee,'' and in 1985 she went to Paris to perform in the revue ''Black and Blue,'' rejoining it later for its Broadway run.         Ms. Brown began to speak out, onstage and in interviews, about the exploitative contracts musicians of her generation had signed. Many hit-making musicians had not recouped debts to their labels, according to record company accounting, and so were not receiving royalties at all. Shortly before Atlantic held a 40th-birthday concert at Madison Square Garden in 1988, the label agreed to waive unrecouped debts for Ms. Brown and 35 other musicians of her era and to pay 20 years of retroactive royalties.         Atlantic also contributed nearly $2 million to start the Rhythm and Blues Foundation, which pushed other labels toward royalty reform and distributed millions of dollars directly to musicians in need, although it has struggled to sustain itself in recent years.         ''Black and Blue'' revitalized Ms. Brown's recording career, on labels including Fantasy and Bullseye Blues. Her 1989 album ''Blues on Broadway'' won a Grammy Award for best jazz vocal performance, female. She was a radio host on the public radio shows ''Harlem Hit Parade'' and ''BluesStage.'' In 1995 she released her autobiography, ''Miss Rhythm'' (Dutton), written with Andrew Yule; it won the Gleason Award for music journalism. She was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1993.         She toured steadily, working concert halls, festivals and cabarets. This year she recorded songs for the coming movie by John Sayles, ''Honeydripper,'' and was about to fly to Alabama to act in it when she became ill.         Ms. Brown never learned to read music. ''In school we had music classes, but I ducked them,'' she said in 1995. ''They were just a little too slow. I didn't want to learn to read no note. I knew I could sing it. I woke up one morning and I could sing.''       
         Dr. Edithe J. Levit, an educator who helped reform the bedside tests required for doctors to be licensed and oversaw the National Board of Medical Examiners in the 1970s and '80s, died on Oct. 18 in Amherst, Mass. She was 79.         The cause was lung cancer, her family said.         Dr. Levit joined the board's staff in 1961 and began her studies of testing techniques that led to lasting changes in the ways doctors are evaluated. She was interested in clinical competence and the devising of more objective means for examining a physician's diagnostic course and conduct with patients.         At the time, candidates for medical licenses were observed by an examiner as they treated actual patients, a method that Dr. Levit thought was too subjective.         In the 1960s, she helped introduce a written test, called a patient management problem, to replace face-to-face encounters, and she was later an influential voice for adopting audiovisual aids in testing and putting licensing exams on computer.         Dr. Donald E. Melnick, an internist and the current president of the board, said that Dr. Levit had found earlier clinical exams to be ''not scientifically valid'' and made changes that ''were instrumental in setting a course that guided the board for the next 30 years.''         Dr. Melnick added that clinical testing had since been refined further, to include computer simulations and actor-patients presenting different ailments, in an effort to make ever more precise assessments of prospective doctors.         From 1977 to 1986, Dr. Levit served as the board's president and chief executive; she was among the first women to head a national medical organization, according to an account in the National Library of Medicine.         Edithe Judith Miller was born in Wilkes-Barre, Pa. She graduated from Bucknell University and received her medical degree from the Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1951.         She trained initially as an endocrinologist before becoming director of medical education at Philadelphia General Hospital in the 1950s. She retired in 1986.         Dr. Levit's husband, Dr. Samuel M. Levit, an internist, died in 1994. She lived in Philadelphia before moving to Amherst last year.         Dr. Levit is survived by two sons, Dr. David Levit of Amherst, a psychoanalyst, and Dr. Harry Levit of New Haven, associate director of undergraduate admissions at Yale; a sister, Sylvia Kaufman of Jerusalem; and two grandchildren.       
         Jeane J. Kirkpatrick, the Reagan administration's first United Nations ambassador and a beacon of neoconservative thought who helped guide American military, diplomatic and covert action from 1981 to 1985, died Thursday at her home in Bethesda, Md. She was 80.         Her death was announced yesterday by the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, where she was a senior fellow. The cause was congestive heart failure, said her personal assistant, Tammy Jagyur.         Ms. Kirkpatrick was the first American woman to serve as United Nations ambassador. She was the only woman, and the only Democrat, in President Ronald Reagan's National Security Council. No woman had ever been so close to the center of presidential power without actually residing in the White House.         ''When she put her feet under the desk of the Oval Office, the president listened,'' said William P. Clark Jr., Mr. Reagan's national security adviser during 1982 and 1983. ''And he usually agreed with her.''         President Reagan brought her into his innermost foreign policy circle, the National Security Planning Group. There she weighed the risks and rewards of clandestine warfare in Central America, covert operations against Libya, the disastrous deployment of American marines in Lebanon, the invasion of Grenada and support for rebel forces in Afghanistan.         Her public diplomacy made her a national political figure. She was a star performer at the 1984 Republican national convention, deriding the Democrats as the ''blame America first'' party.         She changed her political affiliation after leaving the Reagan administration and thought hard about seeking the Republican nomination for president.         ''So many people talked to me about it so much that they finally persuaded me to consider it,'' she said in October 1987. But she decided against it, fearing she would split the conservative vote and help elect Vice President George H. W. Bush. Though he won, she thought him too moderate to inherit the Reagan legacy.         Fifteen years later, in March 2003, President Bush recalled Ambassador Kirkpatrick to active duty and sent her to Geneva, said Alan Gerson, who had served as her general counsel at the United Nations. The secret mission, previously undisclosed, was to head off a diplomatic uprising against the imminent war against Iraq. Arab ministers wanted to condemn it as an act of aggression.         ''The marching orders we received were to argue that pre-emptive war is legitimate,'' Mr. Gerson said. ''She said: 'No one will buy it. If that's the position, count me out.' ''         Instead, she argued that the attack was justified by Saddam Hussein's violations of United Nations resolutions dating from the 1991 war against Iraq. The foreign ministers found her position convincing and their resolve against the war faded, Mr. Gerson said.         Ms. Kirkpatrick was a political science professor with no diplomatic experience when she arrived at the United Nations in February 1981. Her mission was to wage rhetorical warfare against Moscow and its allies. She sought to restore the international standing of the United States after its defeat in Vietnam and the captivity of Americans in Iran.         Her high-profile performance at the United Nations made her President Reagan's favorite envoy. ''You're taking off that big sign that we used to wear that said, 'Kick Me,' '' the president told her. He admired her strong diplomatic stands and her undiplomatic language. In a letter to 40 third world ambassadors in October 1981, for example, she accused them of spreading ''base lies'' and making ''malicious attacks upon the good name of the United States.''         When nations opposed American foreign policy, she sent their voting records to Congress. The threat was tacit but clear: to stand against the United States meant to risk losing its foreign aid. Her deputy at the United Nations, Kenneth L. Adelman, said she enjoyed such close combat.         ''We were like Davy Crockett at the Alamo,'' he said.         Said She Hated U.N. Job         She professed to detest the United Nations. She compared it to ''death and taxes.'' But she endured it for four years.         At the United Nations, she defended Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and the American invasion of Grenada in 1983. She argued for El Salvador's right-wing junta and against Nicaragua's left-wing ruling council, the Sandinistas.         In private, she supported American efforts to sustain the contras, the rebel group that tried to overthrow the Sandinistas with help from the Central Intelligence Agency She was a crucial participant in a March 1981 National Security Planning Group meeting that produced a $19 million covert action plan to make the contras a fighting force.         She was part of a national security team that was often at war with itself. Her relationship with Mr. Reagan's first secretary of state, the four-star general Alexander M. Haig Jr., ''started off bad and got worse over time,'' Mr. Adelman said in an oral history of the Reagan years. She had something Mr. Haig found that he lacked: the president's ear.         Ms. Kirkpatrick first entered Mr. Reagan's inner circle on the strength of a 10,000-word article she published in the neoconservative magazine Commentary in November 1979. The article, ''Dictatorships and Double Standards,'' drew a bright line between right-wing pro-American governments and left-wing anti-American ones.         ''Traditional authoritarian governments,'' she argued, ''are less repressive than revolutionary autocracies.'' She said it was an historic mistake for the United States to have shied away from dictators like the Somozas in Nicaragua and the Shah of Iran. If they served American interests, she asserted, they were defensible.         Mr. Reagan read the article closely. Richard V. Allen, who later became the first of his six national security advisers, introduced him to Ms. Kirkpatrick. They met at a February 1980 dinner party given by George F. Will, the syndicated columnist.         She recalled that she wondered aloud how she, a Democrat all her life, could join his team. Mr. Reagan confided, ''I was a Democrat once, you know.'' He won her over. After his election a year later, Ms. Kirkpatrick became the United Nations ambassador and ''Dictatorships and Double Standards'' became an important part of the foreign policy of the United States.         At the United Nations, Ms. Kirkpatrick was the target of barbs and backstabbing. Sometimes she was aware of the source, sometimes not.         She knew she was ''a kind of special target for the Soviets -- disinformation target,'' she said at a 2003 foreign policy roundtable convened by the Miller Center of Public Affairs at the University of Virginia. In 1982, the K.G.B. forged a letter to discredit her and fobbed it off on the Washington correspondent for The New Statesman, a leftist British weekly, which reprinted it. The phony letter was a note of ''best regards and gratitude'' from the intelligence chief of the apartheid South African government.         ''But I felt there was as much disinformation aimed at me from inside our own government, frankly, as from the Soviet Union,'' Ms. Kirkpatrick said. ''That's a shocking thing to say, but it is no exaggeration.''         Role as Adviser Blocked         In 1983, Ms. Kirkpatrick was a strong candidate to become President Reagan's third national security adviser. She had support from the director of central intelligence, William J. Casey, and Defense Secretary Caspar W. Weinberger. But her new boss, Secretary of State George P. Shultz, opposed her.         ''I respected her intelligence, but she was not well suited to the job,'' Mr. Shultz wrote. ''Her strength was in her capacity for passionate advocacy,'' and the post, he added, demanded a ''dispassionate broker.''         Ms. Kirkpatrick was at the June 1984 National Security Planning Group meeting that began the secret initiative that later became known as the Iran-contra affair. Congress had cut off funds for the contras. Mr. Casey wanted to obtain money from foreign countries in defiance of the ban.         Ms. Kirkpatrick was in favor. ''We should make the maximum effort to find the money,'' she said. Mr. Shultz was opposed. ''It is an impeachable offense,'' he said. President Reagan warned that if the story leaked, ''we'll all be hanging by our thumbs in front of the White House.''         Secret Arms Sales Exposed         Over the next two years, millions skimmed from secret arms sales to Iran went to the contras. The story did leak, as Mr. Reagan feared, and his Administration was shaken by Congressional investigations and criminal charges. Robert C. McFarlane, who had won the national security slot over Ms. Kirkpatrick, pleaded guilty to misinforming Congress.         Mr. McFarlane said he should have stood up against the secret initiative to support the contras. But ''if I'd done that,'' he said, ''Bill Casey, Jeane Kirkpatrick and Cap Weinberger would have said I was some kind of commie.''         By then Ms. Kirkpatrick had left the government. She stuck to a vow to leave the United Nations at the end of Mr. Reagan's first term and resigned in April 1985. She was succeeded by Vernon A. Walters, a former deputy director of central intelligence. The next year, as the Iran-contra story began unfolding, Mr. Casey urged the president to make her secretary of state, but Mr. Reagan rejected the idea.         Ms. Kirkpatrick spent the rest of her career commenting on policy instead of making it. She remained among the most highly regarded members of the Republican establishment, and her voice remained one of the strongest echoes of the Reagan era.         Jeane Duane Jordan was born on Nov. 19, 1926, in Duncan, Okla., about 160 miles northwest of Dallas, the daughter of Welcher F. and Leona Jordan. Her father was an oil wildcatter who moved from town to town searching for a gusher that he never hit.         She attended Stephens College in Missouri for two years, then moved to New York, where she earned a bachelor's degree from Barnard College in 1948 and a master's degree from Columbia University in 1950. She went to Washington as a research analyst at the Intelligence and Research Bureau of the State Department, where she met her future husband, Evron Kirkpatrick. Fifteen years her senior, he was a veteran of the wartime Office of Strategic Services, and he soon became the head of the American Political Science Association. They married in 1955 and had three sons -- Douglas Jordan, John Evron and Stuart Alan. Douglas died earlier this year. The other sons and five grandchildren survive her. Mr. Kirkpatrick died in 1995.         In 1967, before completing her doctoral dissertation, she was appointed associate professor at Georgetown University. The next year, she earned a doctorate in political science at Columbia University. Georgetown made her a full professor in 1973 and gave her the endowed Leavey Chair five years later.         Ms. Kirkpatrick supported Jimmy Carter in 1976 and came close to being chosen for an ambassadorship in his administration. But she had become deeply disenchanted with her party.         Swept In With 50 Others         She joined the vanguard of the neoconservative movement, the Committee on the Present Danger, which warned throughout the late 1970s of a disastrous downturn in every aspect of American strength, from nuclear warheads to national image. When Mr. Reagan came to office in 1981, 51 of the committee's members won positions of significant power in his administration.         Power, Ms. Kirkpatrick said in a 1996 interview, is based not merely on guns or money but on the strength of personal conviction.         ''We were concerned about the weakening of Western will,'' she said. ''We advocated rebuilding Western strength, and we did that with Ronald Reagan, if I may say so.''       
         Ruth Bernhard, whose classical black-and-white photographs of the female nude and inanimate objects earned her a place of distinction among 20th-century photographers, died on Monday at her home in San Francisco. She was 101.         The San Francisco medical examiner's office said her death was of natural causes.         Ms. Bernhard was known primarily for her dramatically lighted nude studies, which expressed her interest in abstract shape and form. ''My quest, through the magic of light and shadow, is to isolate, to simplify and to give emphasis to form with the greatest clarity,'' she said. ''To indicate the ideal proportion, and reveal sculptural mass and the dominating spirit, is my goal.''         In 1935 a chance meeting with the photographer Edward Weston on the beach in Santa Monica, Calif., altered the course of Ms. Bernhard's life. He became her mentor, and she studied with him for years. Seeing his pictures for the first time, she said, was a revelation. ''It was lightning in the darkness,'' she said. ''Here before me was indisputable evidence of what I had thought possible -- an intensely vital artist whose medium was photography.''         In the 1940s Ms. Bernhard became part of Group f/64, joining Modernist West Coast photographers like Weston, Ansel Adams, Minor White, Imogen Cunningham, Wynn Bullock and Dorothea Lange. All took a purist approach to their subjects. Their work is characterized by photographic clarity and detailed precision.         Weston's influence, in particular, on Ms. Bernhard's work is evident from the compositional simplicity of his own nude studies and still lifes of organic objects like shells and peppers.         Ms. Bernhard photographed almost exclusively in the studio. She was known to take a single picture from one specific angle after setting up a composition meticulously, sometimes over days.         ''If I have chosen the female form in particular, it is because beauty has been debased and exploited in our sensual 20th century,'' she told Margaretta K. Mitchell, author of ''Ruth Bernhard: Between Art and Life'' (2000). ''Woman has been the subject of much that is sordid and cheap, especially in photography. To raise, to elevate, to endorse with timeless reverence the image of woman has been my mission.''         She supported herself by holding private classes in her studio and leading workshops. She published several books of photographs, and her work is in collections at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, the Museum of Fine Arts in Houston and the Victoria and Albert Museum in London.         Ruth Bernhard was born in Berlin in 1905. Her parents, Lucian and Gertrud, divorced when she was 2, and her father brought her up with the help of two teachers, both women, in their 40s. A graphic designer and typographer, her father was known for designing the font Bernhard, which is still in use. He married again and had four children. Two half-brothers -- Karl, of Afton, N.Y., and Alexander, of London -- survive her.         Ms. Bernhard followed her father to New York in 1927 after she completed two years at the Academy of Fine Arts in Berlin. She began photographing the female nude in the early 1930s and eventually became acquainted with Berenice Abbott and her artistic circle. She also supported herself with commercial photographic assignments.         In the early 1940s Ms. Bernhard became involved with an artist and designer, Eveline Phimister, and for the next 10 years they lived together in New York, then in Carmel, Calif.; Los Angeles; and San Francisco, which became Ms. Bernhard's permanent home in 1953.         In 1967 she became involved with an Air Force colonel, Price Rice, 10 years her junior. She remained with him until his death in 1999. Ms. Bernhard talked openly in Ms. Mitchell's book about her many affairs with men and women. ''I allowed life to give me presents,'' she told Ms. Mitchell. ''And everything just sort of happened the way it was supposed to happen. I did not pursue anything. It more or less pursued me.''
