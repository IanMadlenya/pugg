Agatha Singer, a retired New York City physician who for many years worked in child-health care in the city's Health Department, died Sunday at New York Hospital. She was 76 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Dr. Singer also worked as an administrator at the Goldwater Memorial Hospital and, most recently, as a general-practice physician with the Strang Clinic-Preventive Medicine Institute. She retired in 1981.  She is survived by her husband, Andrew; a daughter, Paulette Barrett of Manhattan, and three grandsons.       
        Renee Pollack, executive director of Westchester Jewish Community Services, died of a cerebral hemorrhage Thursday in White Plains Hospital Medical Center. She was 53 years old and lived in Hartsdale, N.Y.         Renee Pollack, executive director of Westchester Jewish Community Services, died of a cerebral hemorrhage Thursday in White Plains Hospital Medical Center. She was 53 years old and lived in Hartsdale, N.Y.         Under her leadership, Westchester Jewish Community Services became the first mental health agency in New York State to be certified as a home health agency.         She is survived by a son, Ross, of Hartsdale, and a daughter, Janet, of White Plains.       
        Carmen Polo de Franco, the Spanish dictator's widow, who was considered a significant influence on some of the repressive policies of his 36-year rule, died today in her Madrid apartment. She was 87 years old.         Carmen Polo de Franco, the Spanish dictator's widow, who was considered a significant influence on some of the repressive policies of his 36-year rule, died today in her Madrid apartment. She was 87 years old.         Mrs. Franco's doctor, Dr. Vicente Pozuelo Escudero, said she died of complications from bronchial pneumonia contracted on Feb. 1.         Queen Sofia went to Mrs. Franco's Madrid apartment to deliver condolences to Mrs. Franco's daughter, Carmen Franco de Martinez-Bordiu, 60, and her husband, on behalf of King Juan Carlos and herself.         In 1969, Franco designated Juan Carlos to be his successor, and Juan Carlos resumed the Spanish monarchy two days after Franco's death on Nov. 20, 1975. Figurehead of Movement         When her husband died, Mrs. Franco became the figurehead of a loosely formed organization of Franco's political followers, called ''El Movimiento.'' Each anniversary of Franco's death prompts thousands of fascists to march in the streets.         Mrs. Franco annually attended a funeral Mass in her husband's memory at the underground basilica in the Valley of the Fallen outside Madrid, where thousands of Nationalists killed in the 1936-39 Spanish Civil War are buried.         Ill health kept her from attending the 1987 memorial. An estimated 5,000 people attended the Mass, at the end of which they gave the fascist salute and shouted ''Franco! Franco! Franco!''         Mrs. Franco was born Carmen Polo on July 9, 1900, in the northern city of Oviedo, the daughter of a wealthy businessman. She was educated by Salesian nuns. In Spanish Morocco         She married Francisco Franco, then an up-and-coming army lieutenant colonel, on Oct. 22, 1923, and the couple left soon after for Spanish Morocco, where Franco was responsible for much of the conduct of the Riff Wars and where he built the military power base that served his successful uprising against the Republican Government.         Mrs. Franco exercised a strong influence on her husband, particularly in connection with affairs of the Roman Catholic Church and public morality.         Social historians say her puritanical upbringing was responsible for the heavy censorship of anything touching on sex or sexual matters in Spanish literature, theater and cinema during most of the 1939-75 Franco regime.         A man who answered the telephone at the apartment of Mrs. Franco's daughter said burial was scheduled for Sunday in the village of El Pardo on the outskirts of Madrid.         In addition to her daughter, Mrs. Franco is survived by seven grandchildren and numerous great-grandchildren.

Dr. Esther Oshiver Fisher, a retired marriage counselor, died of complications from Alzheimer's disease Feb. 13 at her home in Princeton, N.J. She was 77 years old.         Dr. Fisher was director of training in marriage counseling at the Institutes of Religion and Health in the 1960's and 70's. She was founding editor of The Journal of Divorce.

        Heather O'Rourke, familiar to moviegoers as the child swept into another world by ghosts in ''Poltergeist'' and its sequel, ''Poltergeist II,'' died at Children's Hospital and Health Center in San Diego Monday. She was 12 years old.         Heather O'Rourke, familiar to moviegoers as the child swept into another world by ghosts in ''Poltergeist'' and its sequel, ''Poltergeist II,'' died at Children's Hospital and Health Center in San Diego Monday. She was 12 years old.         She died as a result of an acute bowel obstruction, complicated by septic shock, said a spokesman for the hospital, Vincent Bond. He said Miss O'Rourke had undergone surgery for the obstruction, which was congenital, after an emergency flight to the hospital from another hospital in the area.         Miss O'Rourke had finished shooting the forthcoming ''Poltergeist III'' last June. A statement by M-G-M, the studio that produced all three films, said her death was unexpected, and the cause ''unknown at this time.''         Steven Spielberg, who co-wrote and co-produced ''Poltergeist,'' discovered Miss O'Rourke by chance when she was visiting the M-G-M studios. After the 1982 film, she appeared in television shows such as ''Webster'' and ''Still the Beaver'' and had a recurring role on ''Happy Days'' as the daughter of Henry Winkler's girlfriend. She played a blind girl on a recent episode of ''Our House.''         But she was most memorable in her debut film, in which she played a key role as the youngest child of a suburban family. With her wide eyes, long blonde hair and soft voice, she was so striking that the sequel played off her presence. Her slight voice, eerily singing ''They're baaack!'' to announce the ghosts' return, became the tag line in the film's advertising.         She is survived by her parents, Katherine and Jim, of San Diego.

Morris, a bacteriologist and immunologist who held posts with several public and private health agencies, died of heart failure April 1 at New York Hospital. She was 85 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Dr. Morris, who was born in Holyoke, Mass., was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Smith College and received a Ph.D. from Washington University Medical School in St. Louis. She taught at Vassar College before joining the Public Health Research Institute, a nonprofit agency in New York.         From 1952 until 1962 she was with the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, allocating scholarships and fellowships in the health professions. In 1963 she became assistant scientific director for the Health Research Council of New York. She retired in 1971.         Dr. Morris is survived by a sister, Lillian O'Connell of Holyoke.       
        Louise Nevelson, a pioneer creator of environmental sculpture who became one of the world's best-known women artists, died yesterday evening at her home on Spring Street in Manhattan. She was 88 years old, and had been in poor health for several months.         Louise Nevelson, a pioneer creator of environmental sculpture who became one of the world's best-known women artists, died yesterday evening at her home on Spring Street in Manhattan. She was 88 years old, and had been in poor health for several months.         She had worked steadily almost until the time of her death, and had recently produced a 35-foot black steel sculpture, which is being installed at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. A show of her work from the 1950's will be seen this summer at the Pompidou Center in Paris.         Mrs. Nevelson was an artist of the first rank, and among the most arresting women of her time. Mystery in Sculpture         She was known above all for her wall sculptures. When modern sculpture in general was getting more and more open and transparent, Mrs. Nevelson caught the public imagination by her command of darkness and deep shadow. She brought mystery back into sculpture, and the observer who stood for some time in front of one of her black walls was reminded of something not easily found in north America: the impact of carved wood and stone in a twilit Gothic cathedral. Her black walls lived in shadow and drew sustenance from it, and a large public found in her work a satisfaction that it found nowhere else in modern art.         She was born in Kiev, Russia, in September 1899. (The exact date of her birth was uncertain, but she settled for Sept. 23). She was the second of four children. Her parents were Isaac Berliawsky and his wife, Minna Zeisel Smolerank.         Her father and her grandfather were in the timber business. In 1902 her father decided to start a new life in the United States. True to the family tradition, he went into the lumber business in Rockland, Me., and made a success of it.         His family remained in Russia until he could offer them security in the United States, and this separation was particularly painful to Louise, who lost the power of speech for six months by way of unconscious protest.         When the family was reunited in Rockland, Isaac Berliawsky saw to it that they were dressed in a luxurious and flamboyant style that heightened their foreignness. Louise Nevelson was indoctrinated into this mode of life to the point of lifelong addiction; and although she cared nothing for possessions and still less for comfort, she was to the end of her days a spectacular figure for whom no combination of clothing, headgear and jewelry could be too startling.         It never occurred to her to be anything but an artist. In her autobiographical book, ''Dawns and Dusks,'' she related how a librarian in Rockland, Me., asked her what she would be when she grew up. ''I'm going to be an artist,'' she replied. ''A sculptor. I don't want color to help me.'' A feeling for wood had been bred into her, and by the time she was 6 she was already working with small pieces of wood that she had scavenged from her father's lumber yard. She told friends in later years that in school she was always cold and only found warmth when she was in art class.         She also inherited from her parents a passionate belief in freedom and independence of thought, a radical orientation in politics, and a crusader's attitude to the emancipation of women. A Dabbler in Different Arts         She grew up to be a tall, rangy, speculative and almost preternaturally determined young woman who was bent on trying all the arts, either one by one or simultaneously, until she found the one that fulfilled her completely. It turned out to be her first love, sculpture; but on the way to that definitive realization, she tried painting and drawing, tried the piano, tried acting, singing and modern dance.         ''I never made friends,'' she said later, ''because I didn't intend to stay in Rockland, and I didn't want anything to tie me down.'' In 1920, however, she was married to Charles Nevelson, whose family was in the shipping business, and moved to New York. Her son and only child, Myron Nevelson, was born in 1922.         From 1920 onward she was responsible for her own education. With her fiery and tenacious nature, she was not cut out for the routine and restraints of a well-run, well-financed family life. After 11 years of ever-increasing discontent, she separated from Mr. Nevelson in 1931. Thereafter she was responsible - financially, morally and in every other way - for herself alone. This had its price, but she paid it gladly. An Extra in Films         In 1929-30 she studied at the Art Students League in New York with Kenneth Hayes Miller. But her regained freedom allowed her to go to what then seemed to her the indispensable source of modern art: Hans Hofmann's school in Munich. Hofmann was indeed a great teacher, but in Munich in 1931 the rise of the Nazi Party made it difficult for him or his students to give of their best. After a few months, Hofmann went into exile and Mrs. Nevelson thereby lost her main reason for being in Europe.         People in Germany responded, as they did everywhere, to her uproarious vitality, and for a time she worked in Berlin and Vienna as an extra in the movies. But that uproarious vitality could turn to melancholy and self-questioning; both then and in 1932, during a second journey to Europe, she had low moments at which her longed-for fulfillment seemed as far away as ever.         As she was a practicing artist for 30 years before she made her first sale, Mrs. Nevelson's progress could be said to have been both slow and scant. But she was bent on working in her own country and on her own terms. ''I could be a leaf on the tree in Paris,'' she once said, ''but I could be the whole tree in America.''         Even so, that tree had to be planted. Mrs. Nevelson returned to this country for good in 1932, but it was several years before she made anything that was distinctly her own. She drew, studied for a while with Hofmann (who in the meantime had established himself in New York), she kept up her studies in theater and dance, and for a time she worked as an assistant to Diego Rivera while he was preparing his murals for Rockefeller Center.         Like many others at that time, she was preoccupied with the art of pre-Columbian Mexico, and in 1933 she made a small stone group of two figures in a style closely akin to the reclining figures that Henry Moore was making at that time and under that same influence. A Variety of Influences         In the spring of 1936, Mrs. Nevelson entered a competitive exhibition at the A.C.A. Gallery in New York and was one of four young artists invited to show at the A.C.A. in September of that year. Her work on that occasion was singled out for extended notice in The New York Times, in which her sculptures were described as ''unlike anything we've ever seen before.''         But a good notice doesn't pay any bills, and for most of the 1930's Mrs. Nevelson had no success and little or no money. She lived in one place after another, treating her studio as an ark to be filled, and no sooner filled than left.         Meanwhile, life touched her at many points. While crossing the Atlantic in 1932, for instance, she met Louis-Ferdinand Celine, the French novelist who was already famous for his ''Journey to the End of the Night'' and was to become notorious during and after World War II for the ferocity of his anti-Semitism. Celine was attracted to her, as were many other gifted men. Some years later, when he wanted to stay on in the United States, he went so far as to propose marriage. Mrs. Nevelson by then could see where his sympathies lay, and with characteristic forthrightness showed him the door and told him that she would rather see him dead than alive.         ''I was often depressed and alone,'' she said later of herself at that period, ''but I was functioning as my own person and that kept me going.'' After she had pawned the last relics of her comfortable married life, it would have been natural for her to apply to the Works Progress Administration for one of the mural or sculptural commissions for which she was well suited. But she was proud and kept putting it off, and in the end all that could be offered her was a teaching post at the Educational Alliance School of Art in Lower Manhattan. 'I Built An Empire'         That apart, Mrs. Nevelson had total control of her time. That she was very poor was part of a price that she paid. ''There's a price for what you do,'' she once said, ''and there's a price for what you don't do. It's a two-way deal.'' Even at the lowest point in her outward fortunes she refused to contemplate any change in her working habits. ''I needed my full consciousness to project ideas,'' she said later. ''I didn't want to make things. I built an empire, and you don't build on that scale by cutting time.''         Even so, it irked her that nobody saw her work. In 1941 she decided that after 20 years' work she had the right to have an exhibition. But not just ''a show'': a show at the best gallery in town. She picked Karl Nierendorf, whose gallery at that time had enormous prestige. She went in to see Mr. Nierendorf, undeterred by the fact that he had never before shown an American artist. Such was the force of her conviction that he came to her studio that same evening and agreed to give her a show the following month. A Circus Is Devised         Nothing remains of this show, but from all accounts it is clear that Mrs. Nevelson conceived of an exhibition as an environment that could remind the visitor of a prehistoric cave, an Egyptian tomb or an unusually well-conceived shop window. Since 1931 she had been interested in African and in American Indian art as well as the art of pre-Columbian Mexico; and since the Museum of Modern Art's ''Fantastic Art-Dada and Surrealism'' of 1936 she had been aware both of the potential of the dream and the automatic procedures that were an important part of European surrealism.         When she showed as a guest at the Norlyst Gallery in 1943, she devised a complete circus in which the performers (both human and animal), the audience and the walls of the circus tent were all most carefully presented. The sculptures in question combined standing African figures, the collocations of found objects fundamental to surrealism, and her own sturdy and unceasing invention. Nothing from the show was sold, and when it was over she took the work back to her studio and burned it.         What in another artist might have been either perversity or pique was in her case a recurrent compulsion to close the account and move on. As of 1943, Mrs. Nevelson's habits became less nomadic, in that a legacy from her father allowed her to buy a house and garden on East 30th Street. Karl Nierendorf's continuing support added a further element of stability, and 1944 and 1945 in particular were years of great creativity, in which a powerful and irreducible nature was clearly getting close to its definitive expression. Sculpture As Cinema         In 1946 she had an exhibition at the Nierendorf Gallery called ''Ancient City.'' In this, perhaps for the first time, she proved that she could sum up a complete world - most often, a vanished and unpopulated one - with just one or two disparate objects. What she needed to arrive at her definitive and entirely personal style was a way of combining many insights of this sort within a single monumental sculpture.         The concentrated effort that she needed to put forward to that end was blocked, however, by a long series of misfortunes. Mr. Nierendorf died, she herself underwent serious internal surgery and was too weak to go on working as usual, and none of the media with which she experimented proved satisfactory. Nearly 10 years were to pass before her next substantial exhibition, at the Grand Central Moderns Gallery in 1955.         Most of the pieces in that show stood on wooden crates, which Mrs. Nevelson fragmented and reconstituted to form, in effect, a shallow cubist space. Eventually, at Christmas 1957, it appeared to her that spaces of this kind need not merely support her sculptures. They could enclose them, forming thereby an indefinitely extensible grid. It was on this principle, which reputedly came to her after close scrutiny of an empty liquor crate, that her mature style was based.         It proved ideal for her purposes. It gave an all-over structure within which incidents of every conceivable kind could be accommodated. Though immutably and self-evidently frontal, it offered deep shadow and an illusion of depth. What had previously stood was literally ''boxed in,'' and the wall-sized sculptures that resulted had something of theater - and of cinema also: Mrs. Nevelson had not forgotten that what we see on the screen is just a long succession of single images, each one of them boxed into a celluloid frame of identical size. Breakthrough in 1958         When two of the earliest and grandest of these walls, ''Sky Cathedral,'' was shown in 1958, Hilton Kramer wrote of them in The New York Times that they were ''appalling and marvelous, utterly shocking in the way they violate our received ideas on the subject of sculpture and the confusion of genres, yet profoundly exhilarating in the way they open an entire realm of possibility.''         As much as any artist of her generation, Mrs. Nevelson had to wait for success. Her first real breakthrough in terms of widespread public attention did not come until the winter of 1958-59, when Dorothy Miller included her in one of the anthologies of new American art that she organized at the Museum of Modern Art.         Mrs. Nevelson was in her 60's before she could count on a steady income from her work, and she never forgot, as she once said, what it was like ''to be an American and not be respected by collectors.'' But gradually the big museums and the big collectors came around to the fact that a major artist was in their midst. As for her colleagues, they, too, recognized her human stature. She was president from 1957 to 1959 of the New York chapter of Artists' Equity and president of National Artists' Equity from 1962 to 1964. A Host of Awards         In 1962 she represented the United States at the Venice Biennale, where she characteristically showed gigantic works, made for that place and that occasion, which could not be turned to profit.         She had shows in London, Baden-Baden, Dusseldorf, Zurich, Turin and Berne in 1963-64.         In 1965 she took part in the National Council on Arts and Governmnt in Washington. In 1967 she had a major retrospective at the Whitney Museum in New York.         Public commissions came her way often.         In 1969, she was awarded the MacDowell Colony medal and in 1971 the Brandeis University Creative Award in Sculpture and the Skowhegan Medal for Sculpture. In 1973-75 a large traveling exhibition of her work visited Minneapolis, San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta, Kansas City and Cleveland. In 1975 an exhibition organized by the United States Information Agency was seen in Iran, India and Japan. From 1964 on she showed regularly at the Pace Gallery in New York, where she found in Arnold Glimcher not only a wholehearted champion of her work, but a biographer as well. Commissions Through the 70's         Commissions included work for Princeton University in 1969; a 55-foot wall for Temple Beth-El in Great Neck, L.I., in 1970, and major sculptures in 1973 for Boston, Scottsdale, Ariz. and Binghamton, N.Y.         In 1975 she made a piece called ''Bicentennial Dawn'' for the James A. Byrne Federal Courthouse in Philadelphia, and a black steel sculpture called ''Transparent Horizon'' for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.         In 1979 Mrs. Nevelson made her most visible imprint on New York in the form of the Louise Nevelson Plaza, an entire outdoor environment of her black sculptures on lower Maiden Lane in Manhattan. Her most recent commissions included a large white interior created for the Georgia-Pacific Corporation in Atlanta, and a large black steel outdoor environment for a corporate sponsor in Chicago.         Mrs. Nevelson never allowed success to alter her way of life. If anything, she became progressively more and more independent of material possessions. Her collection of paintings by Louis Eilshemius was sold in times of stress, as was her collection of primitive art. In her house on Spring Street she lived as simply as it is possible for a human being to live, though she saw to it that her guests were looked after in exemplary style.         Nor was she ever deterred by the challenge of a new material or a new kind of commission; one of the great successes of her career, opened in December 1977, was the Chapel of the Good Shepherd in St. Peter's Church on Lexington Avenue at 54th Street. Like the Matisse chapel in Vence, France, and the Rothko chapel in Houston, this exemplified the powers of adaptation that some artists can carry into old age. But then Louise Nevelson was never touched by old age. She put it in its place and went on with the only thing that mattered to her: her work.         She is survived by her son, Myron, three granddaughters, and two great granddaughters. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be announced at a later date.

Like many others at that time, she was preoccupied with the art of pre-Columbian Mexico, and in 1933 she made a small stone group of two figures in a style closely akin to the reclining figures that Henry Moore was making at that time and under that same influence. A Variety of Influences         In the spring of 1936, Mrs. Nevelson entered a competitive exhibition at the A.C.A. Gallery in New York and was one of four young artists invited to show at the A.C.A. in September of that year. Her work on that occasion was singled out for extended notice in The New York Times, in which her sculptures were described as ''unlike anything we've ever seen before.''         But a good notice doesn't pay any bills, and for most of the 1930's Mrs. Nevelson had no success and little or no money. She lived in one place after another, treating her studio as an ark to be filled, and no sooner filled than left. Such was her compulsion to work hard and move on that she seemed to be reliving in microcosm the trauma of enforced migration that was endured by hundreds of thousands of European refugees in the 1930's and was shortly to be experienced by even greater numbers of people.         Mrs. Nevelson felt such things in her whole body, as a great dancer feels them; and with her well-developed sense of theater and her first-hand experience of the film studio, where whole environments are no sooner built than they are dismantled, she gradually felt her way toward the work for which she eventually became famous. Celine Was a Suitor         Meanwhile, life touched her at many points. While crossing the Atlantic in 1932, for instance, she met Louis-Ferdinand Celine, the French novelist who was already famous for his ''Journey to the End of the Night'' and was to become notorious during and after World War II for the ferocity of his anti-Semitism. Celine was attracted to her, as were many other gifted men. Some years later, when he wanted to stay on in the United States, he went so far as to propose marriage. Mrs. Nevelson by then could see where his sympathies lay, and with characteristic forthrightness showed him the door and told him that she would rather see him dead than alive.         ''I was often depressed and alone,'' she said later of herself at that period, ''but I was functioning as my own person and that kept me going.'' After she had pawned the last relics of her comfortable married life, it would have been natural for her to apply to the Works Progress Administration for one of the mural or sculptural commissions for which she was well suited. But she was proud and kept putting it off, and in the end all that could be offered her was a teaching post at the Educational Alliance School of Art in Lower Manhattan. 'I Built An Empire'         That apart, Mrs. Nevelson had total control of her time. That she was very poor was part of a price that she paid. ''There's a price for what you do,'' she once said, ''and there's a price for what you don't do. It's a two-way deal.'' Even at the lowest point in her outward fortunes she refused to contemplate any change in her working habits. ''I needed my full consciousness to project ideas,'' she said later. ''I didn't want to make things. I built an empire, and you don't build on that scale by cutting time.''         Even so, it irked her that nobody saw her work. In 1941 she decided that after 20 years' work she had the right to have an exhibition. But not just ''a show'': a show at the best gallery in town. She picked Karl Nierendorf, whose gallery at that time had enormous prestige. She went in to see Mr. Nierendorf, undeterred by the fact that he had never before shown an American artist. Such was the force of her conviction that he came to her studio that same evening and agreed to give her a show the following month. A Circus Is Devised         Nothing remains of this show, but from all accounts it is clear that Mrs. Nevelson conceived of an exhibition as an environment that could remind the visitor of a prehistoric cave, an Egyptian tomb or an unusually well-conceived shop window. Since 1931 she had been interested in African and in American Indian art as well as the art of pre-Columbian Mexico; and since the Museum of Modern Art's ''Fantastic Art-Dada and Surrealism'' of 1936 she had been aware both of the potential of the dream and the automatic procedures that were an important part of European surrealism.         When she showed as a guest at the Norlyst Gallery in 1943, she devised a complete circus in which the performers (both human and animal), the audience and the walls of the circus tent were all most carefully presented. The sculptures in question combined standing African figures, the collocations of found objects fundamental to surrealism, and her own sturdy and unceasing invention. Nothing from the show was sold, and when it was over she took the work back to her studio and burned it.         What in another artist might have been either perversity or pique was in her case a recurrent compulsion to close the account and move on. As of 1943, Mrs. Nevelson's habits became less nomadic, in that a legacy from her father allowed her to buy a house and garden on East 30th Street. Karl Nierendorf's continuing support added a further element of stability, and 1944 and 1945 in particular were years of great creativity, in which a powerful and irreducible nature was clearly getting close to its definitive expression. Sculpture As Cinema         In 1946 she had an exhibition at the Nierendorf Gallery called ''Ancient City.'' In this, perhaps for the first time, she proved that she could sum up a complete world - most often, a vanished and unpopulated one - with just one or two disparate objects. What she needed to arrive at her definitive and entirely personal style was a way of combining many insights of this sort within a single monumental sculpture.         The concentrated effort that she needed to put forward to that end was blocked, however, by a long series of misfortunes. Mr. Nierendorf died, she herself underwent serious internal surgery and was too weak to go on working as usual, and none of the media with which she experimented proved satisfactory. Nearly 10 years were to pass before her next substantial exhibition, at the Grand Central Moderns Gallery in 1955.         Most of the pieces in that show stood on wooden crates, which Mrs. Nevelson fragmented and reconstituted to form, in effect, a shallow cubist space. Eventually, at Christmas 1957, it appeared to her that spaces of this kind need not merely support her sculptures. They could enclose them, forming thereby an indefinitely extensible grid. It was on this principle, which reputedly came to her after close scrutiny of an empty liquor crate, that her mature style was based.         It proved ideal for her purposes. It gave an all-over structure within which incidents of every conceivable kind could be accommodated. Though immutably and self-evidently frontal, it offered deep shadow and an illusion of depth. What had previously stood was literally ''boxed in,'' and the wall-sized sculptures that resulted had something of theater - and of cinema also: Mrs. Nevelson had not forgotten that what we see on the screen is just a long succession of single images, each one of them boxed into a celluloid frame of identical size. Breakthrough in 1958         When two of the earliest and grandest of these walls, ''Sky Cathedral,'' was shown in 1958, Hilton Kramer wrote of them in The New York Times that they were ''appalling and marvelous, utterly shocking in the way they violate our received ideas on the subject of sculpture and the confusion of genres, yet profoundly exhilarating in the way they open an entire realm of possibility.''         As much as any artist of her generation, Mrs. Nevelson had to wait for success. Her first real breakthrough in terms of widespread public attention did not come until the winter of 1958-59, when Dorothy Miller included her in one of the anthologies of new American art that she organized at the Museum of Modern Art.         Mrs. Nevelson was in her 60's before she could count on a steady income from her work, and she never forgot, as she once said, what it was like ''to be an American and not be respected by collectors.'' But gradually the big museums and the big collectors came around to the fact that a major artist was in their midst. As for her colleagues, they, too, recognized her human stature. She was president from 1957 to 1959 of the New York chapter of Artists' Equity and president of National Artists' Equity from 1962 to 1964. A Host of Awards         In 1962 she represented the United States at the Venice Biennale, where she characteristically showed gigantic works, made for that place and that occasion, which could not be turned to profit.         She had shows in London, Baden-Baden, Dusseldorf, Zurich, Turin and Berne in 1963-64.         In 1965 she took part in the National Council on Arts and Governmnt in Washington. In 1967 she had a major retrospective at the Whitney Museum in New York.         Public commissions came her way often.         In 1969, she was awarded the MacDowell Colony medal and in 1971 the Brandeis University Creative Award in Sculpture and the Skowhegan Medal for Sculpture. In 1973-75 a large traveling exhibition of her work visited Minneapolis, San Francisco, Dallas, Atlanta, Kansas City and Cleveland. In 1975 an exhibition organized by the United States Information Agency was seen in Iran, India and Japan. From 1964 on she showed regularly at the Pace Gallery in New York, where she found in Arnold Glimcher not only a wholehearted champion of her work, but a biographer as well. Commissions Through the 70's         Commissions included work for Princeton University in 1969; a 55-foot wall for Temple Beth-El in Great Neck, L.I., in 1970, and major sculptures in 1973 for Boston, Scottsdale, Ariz. and Binghamton, N.Y.         In 1975 she made a piece called ''Bicentennial Dawn'' for the James A. Byrne Federal Courthouse in Philadelphia, and a black steel sculpture called ''Transparent Horizon'' for the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.         In 1979 Mrs. Nevelson made her most visible imprint on New York in the form of the Louise Nevelson Plaza, an entire outdoor environment of her black sculptures on lower Maiden Lane in Manhattan. Her most recent commissions included a large white interior created for the Georgia-Pacific Corporation in Atlanta, and a large black steel outdoor environment for a corporate sponsor in Chicago.         Mrs. Nevelson never allowed success to alter her way of life. If anything, she became progressively more and more independent of material possessions. Her collection of paintings by Louis Eilshemius was sold in times of stress, as was her collection of primitive art. In her house on Spring Street she lived as simply as it is possible for a human being to live, though she saw to it that her guests were looked after in exemplary style.         Nor was she ever deterred by the challenge of a new material or a new kind of commission; one of the great successes of her career, opened in December 1977, was the Chapel of the Good Shepherd in St. Peter's Church on Lexington Avenue at 54th Street. Like the Matisse chapel in Vence, France, and the Rothko chapel in Houston, this exemplified the powers of adaptation that some artists can carry into old age. But then Louise Nevelson was never touched by old age. She put it in its place and went on with the only thing that mattered to her: her work.         She is survived by her son, Myron, three granddaughters, and two great granddaughters. Funeral services will be private. A memorial service will be announced at a later date.       
        Louise Nevelson, a pioneer creator of environmental sculpture who became one of the world's best-known artists, died Sunday evening at her home on Spring Street in Manhattan. She was 88 years old, and had been in poor health for several months.         Louise Nevelson, a pioneer creator of environmental sculpture who became one of the world's best-known artists, died Sunday evening at her home on Spring Street in Manhattan. She was 88 years old, and had been in poor health for several months.         She had worked steadily almost until her death, and had recently produced a 35-foot black steel sculpture, which is being installed at the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Md. A show of her work from the 1950's will be seen this summer at the Pompidou Center in Paris.         Mrs. Nevelson was an artist of the first rank, and among the most arresting people of her time. Known for Wall Sculptures         She was known above all for her wall sculptures. When modern sculpture in general was getting more and more open and transparent, Mrs. Nevelson caught the public imagination by her command of darkness and deep shadow. She brought mystery back into sculpture, and the observer who stood for some time in front of one of her black walls was reminded of something not easily found in north America: the impact of carved wood and stone in a twilit Gothic cathedral. Her black walls lived in shadow and drew sustenance from it, and a large public found in her work a satisfaction that it found nowhere else in modern art.         She was born in Kiev in the Ukraine in September 1899. (The exact date of her birth was uncertain, but she settled for Sept. 23). She was the second of four children. Her parents were Isaac Berliawsky and his wife, Minna Zeisel Smolerank.         Her father and her grandfather were in the timber business. In 1902 her father decided to start a new life in the United States. True to the family tradition, he went into the lumber business in Rockland, Me., and made a success of it.         His family remained in the Ukraine until he could offer them security in the United States, and this separation was particularly painful to Louise, who lost the power of speech for six months by way of unconscious protest. A Feeling For Wood         When the family was reunited in Rockland, Mr. Berliawsky saw to it that they were dressed in a luxurious and flamboyant style that heightened their foreignness. Louise was indoctrinated into this mode of life to the point of lifelong addiction; and although she cared nothing for possessions and still less for comfort, she was to the end of her days a spectacular figure for whom no combination of clothing, headgear and jewelry could be too startling.         It never occurred to her to be anything but an artist. In her autobiographical book, ''Dawns and Dusks,'' she related how a librarian in Rockland asked her what she would be when she grew up. ''I'm going to be an artist,'' she replied. ''A sculptor. I don't want color to help me.'' A feeling for wood had been bred into her, and by the time she was 6 she was already working with small pieces of wood that she had scavenged from her father's lumber yard. She told friends in later years that in school she was always cold and only found warmth when she was in art class.         She also inherited from her parents a passionate belief in freedom and independence of thought, a radical orientation in politics, and a crusader's attitude to the emancipation of women. A Dabbler in Different Arts         She grew up to be a tall, rangy, speculative and almost preternaturally determined young woman who was bent on trying all the arts, either one by one or simultaneously, until she found the one that fulfilled her completely. It turned out to be her first love, sculpture; but on the way to that definitive realization, she tried painting and drawing, tried the piano, tried acting, singing and modern dance.         ''I never made friends,'' she said later, ''because I didn't intend to stay in Rockland, and I didn't want anything to tie me down.'' In 1920, however, she married Charles Nevelson, whose family was in the shipping business, and moved to New York. Her son and only child, Myron Nevelson, was born in 1922.         From 1920 onward she was responsible for her own education. With her fiery and tenacious nature, she was not cut out for the routine and restraints of a well-run, well-financed family life. After 11 years of ever-increasing discontent, she separated from Mr. Nevelson in 1931. Thereafter she was responsible - financially, morally and in every other way - for herself alone. This had its price, but she paid it gladly. An Extra in Films         In 1929-30 she studied at the Art Students League in New York with Kenneth Hayes Miller. But her regained freedom allowed her to go to what then seemed to her the indispensable source of modern art: Hans Hofmann's school in Munich. Hofmann was indeed a great teacher, but in Munich in 1931 the rise of the Nazi Party made it difficult for him or his students to give of their best. After a few months, Hofmann went into exile and Mrs. Nevelson thereby lost her main reason for being in Europe.         People in Germany responded, as they did everywhere, to her uproarious vitality, and for a time she worked in Berlin and Vienna as an extra in the movies. But that uproarious vitality could turn to melancholy and self-questioning; both then and in 1932, during a second journey to Europe, she had low moments at which her longed-for fulfillment seemed as far away as ever.         As she was a practicing artist for 30 years before she made her first sale, Mrs. Nevelson's progress could be said to have been both slow and scant. But she was bent on working in her own country and on her own terms. ''I could be a leaf on the tree in Paris,'' she once said, ''but I could be the whole tree in America.''         Even so, that tree had to be planted. Mrs. Nevelson returned to this country for good in 1932, but it was several years before she made anything that was distinctly her own. She drew, studied for a while with Hofmann (who in the meantime had established himself in New York), she kept up her studies in theater and dance, and for a time she worked as an assistant to Diego Rivera while he was preparing his murals for Rockefeller Center.         Like many others at that time, she was preoccupied with the art of pre-Columbian Mexico, and in 1933 she made a small stone group of two figures in a style closely akin to the reclining figures that Henry Moore was making at that time and under that same influence. Constant Change, Constant Work         In the spring of 1936, Mrs. Nevelson entered a competitive exhibition at the A.C.A. Gallery in New York and was one of four young artists invited to show at the A.C.A. in September of that year. Her work on that occasion was singled out for extended notice in The New York Times, in which her sculptures were described as ''unlike anything we've ever seen before.''         But a good notice doesn't pay any bills, and for most of the 1930's Mrs. Nevelson had no success and little or no money. She lived in one place after another, treating her studio as an ark to be filled, and no sooner filled than left. Such was her compulsion to work hard and move on that she seemed to be reliving in microcosm the trauma of enforced migration that was endured by hundreds of thousands of European refugees in the 1930's, and shortly to be experienced by even greater numbers of people.

Celine Was a Suitor         Meanwhile, life touched her at many points. While crossing the Atlantic in 1932, for instance, she met Louis-Ferdinand Celine, the French novelist who was already famous for his ''Journey to the End of the Night'' and was to become notorious during and after World War II for the ferocity of his anti-Semitism.

        Hazel Corbin, retired general director of the Maternity Center Association in New York City and a pioneer in maternal and infant health care, died of cardiac failure Wednesday at her home in New Smyrna Beach, Fla. She was 93 years old.         Hazel Corbin, retired general director of the Maternity Center Association in New York City and a pioneer in maternal and infant health care, died of cardiac failure Wednesday at her home in New Smyrna Beach, Fla. She was 93 years old.         Throughout her career, Miss Corbin crusaded for improved maternal and infant care through demonstration projects, research and education of professionals and childbearing families.         As early as the 1930's, she encouraged fathers to take an active part in the care of expectant mothers, setting up special classes for them at Maternity Center clinics.         Miss Corbin was a major force in establishing the Interntional Childbirth Education Association. She was also a strong proponent of nurse-midwifery, encouraging the development of university-based certification programs at Columbia University, the Johns Hopkins University, Yale University and the State University of New York-Downstate Medical Center. Studied at Brooklyn College         A native of Nova Scotia, Miss Corbin came to New York during World War I to study nursing at Brooklyn College, hoping to serve as an Army nurse. Instead, she became the first field nurse in the first Maternity Center, established by the Women's City Club in 1917 to reduce maternal and infant mortality in designated parts of the city.         When the Maternity Center Association was formally organized the next year, she continued to serve in the field and to train other nurses. In 1923 she became general director, a post she held until her retirement in 1965.         He influence went well beyond the city and the field of maternal and infant care. In 1936 she was an organizer of the Public Health Association of New York City. During World War II she was in charge of recruiting nurses for the New York chapter of the American Red Cross.         She also campaigned over the decades to raise state standards for maternal and infant care, and she was a strong advocate of midwifery by trained nurses and of natural childbirth. Martha May Eliot Award         ''When any woman has her baby naturally,'' she explained, ''she cooperates with the forces at work within her body and does the job by her own efforts, with or without assistance to help her along.''         In 1966 Miss Corbin received the Martha May Eliot Award of the American Public Health Association for ''nearly 50 years as a major influence in demonstrating improved childbirth and child-care practices to physicians, nurses and mothers.'' Two years later she was awarded the highest honor of the Maternity Center Association, its Medal for Distinguished Service.         There are no immediate survivors.       
        Ana Aslan, a controversial gerontologist whose clinic in Rumania attracted thousands of people from around the world in search of renewed youth, died May 20 in Bucharest, according to reports from that city and Paris. She was in her early 90's.         Ana Aslan, a controversial gerontologist whose clinic in Rumania attracted thousands of people from around the world in search of renewed youth, died May 20 in Bucharest, according to reports from that city and Paris. She was in her early 90's.         Agence France-Presse reported that her death went unnoticed in Rumania for nearly a week until publication on Thursday of a small item in the obituary column of a Bucharest newspaper. She was buried last Sunday in a civil ceremony, although she had wanted a religious ceremony, Agence France-Presse said.         Dr. Aslan developed a drug named Gerovital H3 that she and a loyal group of followers promoted as an elixir of youth. Detractors asserted that it was simply a solution of procaine, which under the brand name Novocain is widely used by dentists to block pain and is administered to older people as an anti-depressant.         Shortly after World War II, Dr. Aslan, who specialized in treating arthritis, began working with a noted Rumanian hormone specialist, Constantin I. Parhon. In 1954, the Government-sponsored Parhon Institute of Geriatrics was established in Bucharest, and Dr. Aslan soon became its dominant figure. A Magnet for Wealthy People         The institute developed into a magnet for wealthy and prominent people from Europe and other continents, all searching for a way to stave off the ravages of age. Dr. Aslan traveled abroad to lecture and to promote Gerovital and Aslavital, another youth treatment she developed.         Among the famous people who took her treatments - or were widely reported to have done so - were Gen. Charles de Gaulle, Nikita S. Khrushchev, Indira Gandhi, Marshal Tito and Chancellor Konrad Adenauer of West Germany, as well as the actresses Lillian Gish and Marlene Dietrich.         The great majority of scientists outside Rumania dismissed Gerovital as another false fountain of youth. The medical establishment in Britain and the United States, including the National Institutes of Health and the American Medical Association, found it had no merit, and the Food and Drug Administration refused to sanction it. Nevertheless, a few scientists, including the noted endocrinologist Albert C. Simard of the Pasteur Institute in Paris, hailed Gerovital as a wonder drug.         Dr. Aslan herself refused to claim credit for rejuvenating specific celebrities, but neither did she deny extravagant claims by her supporters. A woman who in her 60's and 70's appeared 30 years younger, she was variously reported as having been born between 1896 and 1898.

        Florence Eldridge, the actress who appeared with her husband, Fredric March, in several Broadway plays and movies, including ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' ''The Skin of Our Teeth'' and ''Another Part of the Forest,'' died in a hospital emergency room Monday night in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 86 years old.         Florence Eldridge, the actress who appeared with her husband, Fredric March, in several Broadway plays and movies, including ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' ''The Skin of Our Teeth'' and ''Another Part of the Forest,'' died in a hospital emergency room Monday night in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 86 years old.         The immediate cause of the actress's death was not disclosed, but she had been in frail health for several years. She had lived in a condominium in Montecito, a suburb of Santa Barbara, since 1974. For many years previously, she and Mr. March, who died in 1975 at the age of 77, lived in Manhattan and on a 40-acre farm near New Milford, Conn.         Miss Eldridge, who made her New York stage debut in the chorus of Jerome Kern's ''Rockabye Baby,'' in 1918, was a versatile actress who played in touring stock companies, motion pictures and on Broadway. She Played Mary Tyrone         She topped a distinguished career on the stage in 1956 with her memorable portrayal of the tragic drug addict Mary Tyrone in Eugene O'Neill's autobiographical drama, ''Long Day's Journey Into Night.'' For that performance she was named best actress by the New York Drama Critics Circle.         Miss Eldridge was named Florence McKechnie when she was born on Sept. 5, 1901, in Brooklyn. She graduated from Girls High School and immediately set her sights on an acting career. By 1921 she had made her mark, appearing in the Theater Guild's ''Ambush'' and impelling one critic to call her ''one of the brightest chapters in the season's theatrical history.''         She became one of her era's most celebrated performers, appearing in ''The Cat and the Canary'' (1922), Pirandello's ''Six Characters in Search of an Author'' (1922), and as the neurotic and spoiled Daisy Buchanan in a stage version of F. Scott Fitzgerald's ''Great Gatsby.''         In 1927 she met and appeared opposite Mr. March in Molnar's ''The Swan,'' and they were married within the year. Then, on a repertory tour, they were not allowed to appear in the same plays together, for management considered it unromantic to have a man and wife play lovers. Ascendancy of the Voice         The Marches wound up in Los Angeles in 1928, so the actor could appear in ''The Royal Family'' at a local theater. Sound had just been introduced into films, and Hollywood was eager to give work to stage-trained actors with excellent voices, like Miss Eldridge and Mr. March, and so they settled there.         Miss Eldridge had appeared briefly in a New York-made film in 1923, but her first good movie roles came in 1929, when she made three films, ''The Studio Murder Mystery,'' co-starring Mr. March, ''Charming Sinners'' and ''The Greene Murder Case.'' During the 1930's, while her husband became a major box-office star, she appeared in several movies, including ''The Story of Temple Drake'' (1933), based on William Faulkner's ''Sanctuary,'' ''Les Miserables'' (again with Mr. March, in 1935) and ''Mary of Scotland'' (1936), in which she played Elizabeth I. The acting couple returned to Broadway in 1938 in ''Yr. Obedient Husband,'' a vehicle based on Samuel Pepys's diary, and failed so resoundingly they bought advertising space to apologize. The advertisement, in trade publications, showed the Marches as trapeze artists missing each other's grip in midair. ''Oops, sorry!'' read the caption.  In 1942, during the Broadway run of Thornton Wilder's ''Skin of Our Teeth,'' Miss Eldridge and Mr. March carried on an epic feud with their notoriously temperamental co-star, Tallulah Bankhead. The director of the play, Elia Kazan, in his recent autobiography, ''A Life,'' recalled that nightly, while Miss Eldridge was giving her main speech, Miss Bankhead would conspicuously comb her hair to upstage her. To retaliate, Mr. March stood in the wings gargling loudly while Miss Bankhead gave her big speech. Other Roles Together         In 1948 Miss Eldridge returned to Hollywood to play Mr. March's wife in Lillian Hellman's ''Another Part of the Forest.'' That same year they appeared in a daring and controversial film about euthanasia, variously called ''An Act of Mercy'' and ''An Act of Murder.'' They also acted together in ''Christopher Columbus,'' in which Miss Eldridge was seen as Queen Isabella, in 1949, and, again playing man and wife, in ''Inherit the Wind,'' in 1960.         The Marches had no children of their own, but adopted two, Anthony and Penelope. Miss Eldridge is survived by her daughter, Penelope Fantacci of Florence, Italy; five grandchildren; a great-granddaughter, and two brothers, David I. McKechnie, who lives in Oregon, and Cromwell McKechnie, of Carpenteria, Calif.

She was 79 years old.         Mattie Rice Coney, a schoolteacher and civic leader in Indianapolis known as an advocate for the inner-city poor, died Friday at Cambridge Health Care Center, Indianapolis, after a long illness. She was 79 years old.         Mrs. Coney, born in Gallatin, Tenn., grew up in Indianapolis, where she lived for the rest of her life. A graduate of Butler University, she taught in the Indianapolis public school system for 35 years, retiring in 1965.         She was active in a variety of neighborhood causes and, in 1964, with her husband, Elmo Cooney, founded a neighborhood group, Citizens Forum, to combat housing discrimination against blacks. The group disbanded in 1984 because of the Coneys' poor health. Mr. Coney died that year.         There are no immediate survivors.

Also surviving are two daughters, Elise, of Manhattan, and Lori, of Brooklyn; a sister, Georgianna Sheldon of Bethesda, Md., and two brothers, Dr. Robert Steinman of Lancaster, Pa., and Richard Steinman of Portland, Me.       
        Jennie Lee, a Scottish coal miner's daughter who rose to became a Labor Party Member of Parliament, Minister of State for the Arts and a baroness, died Wednesday at her home in London, a friend, Lord Goodman, said Thursday. She was 84 years old.         Jennie Lee, a Scottish coal miner's daughter who rose to became a Labor Party Member of Parliament, Minister of State for the Arts and a baroness, died Wednesday at her home in London, a friend, Lord Goodman, said Thursday. She was 84 years old.         The cause of death was not immediately disclosed.         Baroness Lee of Asheridge, as she was known after being made a life peer in 1970, held a seat in Parliament for 27 years. She was a member of the Labor Party's national executive from 1958 to 1970 and served as party chairman in 1967 and 1968.         The present leader of the party, Neil Kinnock, on Thursday recalled her as ''a woman of brilliance and vision, a great socialist, who inspired so many and was loved by all who knew her warmth and passion for justice.''         Given special responsibility for the arts in 1965 by Prime Minister Harold Wilson, she played a crucial political role in starting the Open University, which provided higher education by correspondence, over radio and television and at evening classes to many students who had had no other university-level studies. Lesson for a Teacher         Her lifelong concern for the underprivileged was sharpened by her experience while teaching for two years in the late 1920's in a village near Lochgelly in Fifeshire, eastern Scotland.         ''I did not believe that there was any good reason why either the children or myself should come to terms with life as we found it in that bleak mining village,'' she wrote in her volume of memoirs ''This Great Journey.''         ''Most of the misery I saw around me in school, in the streets, and in private homes, had its roots in the poverty of the place,'' she said. ''I did not see how, within the four walls of a classroom, I could ever hope to change any of that.''         She ran successfully for Parliament and represented a Scottish district from 1929 until she lost the seat in 1931. She represented another district, near the industrial city of Birmingham in England, from 1945 until losing that seat in a general election in 1970. She then automatically acquired a seat in the House of Lords on being elevated to the peerage.         A New York Times editorial commented at the time: ''How Scotland's fiery Jennie would have scorned the robes of a baroness early in her Labor Party career!'' Married to Bevan         She was born Janet Lee on Nov. 3, 1904 in Lochgelly. Her father, James Lee, was active in the trade union movement. Her paternal grandfather, Michael Lee, won renown in the movement, rising to be a member of the Scottish Miners' Executive.         Lady Lee was married in 1934 to Aneurin Bevan, a prominent Labor Party figure who was known as Nye. A former coal miner, he was a elected to Parliament in 1929 and remained a Member of Parliament for 31 years, serving as Minister of Health from 1945 to 1951. He died in 1960.         After Jennie Lee was elected to Parliament from Staffordshire in 1945, and Mr. Bevan was re-elected to Parliament in the same elections, they became known as ''Britain's first man-and-wife parliamentary team.''         Lady Lee, who held degrees from the University of Edinburgh, was awarded an honorary Doctor of Laws by Cambridge University. Her books included ''My Life with Nye,'' published in 1980, in addition to ''This Great Journey,'' which was published in the United States in 1942 after appearing first in Britain.         Lady Lee and Mr. Bevan had no children, and she has no survivors.       
        Sheilah Graham, who for some 35 years was part of what she called ''the unholy trio'' of powerful Hollywood gossip columnists - the others were Louella O. Parsons and Hedda Hopper - died Thursday of congestive heart failure at Good Samaritan Hospital in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 84 years old.         Sheilah Graham, who for some 35 years was part of what she called ''the unholy trio'' of powerful Hollywood gossip columnists - the others were Louella O. Parsons and Hedda Hopper - died Thursday of congestive heart failure at Good Samaritan Hospital in Palm Beach, Fla. She was 84 years old.         Miss Graham, who also served as a war correspondent in Europe in World War II and who at various times had her own Hollywood-based radio and television shows, is probably best remembered for her love affair with F. Scott Fitzgerald, whose last unhappy years she described in her first book, ''Beloved Infidel,'' published in 1958.         That book concentrated on the Pygmalion and Galatea aspect of the relationship between the novelist and Miss Graham, in which he created a ''college of one'' for her, drawing up lists of books she read to complete ''the education of a woman,'' as her book was subtitled. 'The Very Best Portrait'         ''Beloved Infidel,'' which Miss Graham wrote in collaboration with Gerold Frank, became an international best seller, received critical approval for its warmth and authenticity, and was hailed by Edmund Wilson in a long review in The New Yorker as ''the very best portrait of Fitzgerald that has yet been put into print.''         Born into poverty in an East London slum, Miss Graham parlayed a native intelligence and her great good looks, under the guidance of several worldly and cultivated men, into a reputation as a bright, brittle and often witty sophisticate.         She labored under no illusions, however, and late in life characterized herself as ''a fascinating fake who pulled the wool over Hollywood's eyes.'' She was also not above turning her talent for abrasive criticism of ''the lightweight pinheads of Hollywood'' upon herself.         For example, in ''The Rest of the Story,'' published in 1964, she wrote: ''Sitting at my typewriter, banging out the items, I sometimes laugh as I stir my witch's brew, putting in the onions and the herbs to give indigestion to people I don't like or to those I think have slighted me, the great me. And it's true that I sometimes mistake my typewriter for my teeth, because the more I bite the more my column will be read.'' A Hard Childhood         Miss Graham's real name was Lily Shiel, which ''to this day horrifies me to a degree impossible to explain,'' she wrote in ''Beloved Infidel.'' When she was an infant, she said, her father died of tuberculosis, and her childhood was characterized by a string of Dickensian hardships. For six years she lived with her mother, a domestic, in a rented basement room, then wound up in an orphanage. As a young woman, she put in a brief stint as a domestic, which she hated, and then went to work in Gamage's department store as a toothbrush demonstrator. Miss Graham said she got the job because she was pretty and had a dazzling smile and perfect teeth, ''thanks to a sweets-deprived childhood in the orphanage.''         At Gamage's she met her first Pygmalion, Maj. John Graham Gillam, who employed her in the iron and steel company in which he was an executive, taught her table manners and coached her to free herself of her Cockney accent. After their marriage, she adopted the name of Sheilah Graham, studied briefly at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art and finally was hired as a chorus girl by C. B. Cochran, the British equivalent of Florenz Zeigfeld, who put her in a 1927 musical revue called ''One Dam Thing After Another.'' When the star fell ill, Miss Graham went on in her place, and, of course, was a smashing success, she said.         Cochran signed her to a contract for other shows and she soon began selling articles about show business to the penny press. She recognized that as a writer she possessed a quality of ''salable mediocrity,'' she said, and decided to carve out a career in journalism. At Home in Hollywood         In 1933, Miss Graham said, she moved to New York and for two years wrote for The New York Mirror and The Evening Journal. In 1935 she was offered North American Newspaper Alliance's syndicated Hollywood column, and she moved to Los Angeles. She divorced Major Gillam in 1937.  She felt at home in Hollywood, more so than she had in New York, she said, because ''Hollywood was notorious even in London for the ignorance of the people who made the films - no one could embarrass me with erudite conversation.''         It was in July 1937, at a party given for her by Robert Benchley to celebrate her engagement to the Marquess of Donegall, that she met Fitzgerald. It was love at first sight for both of them, she said. She broke off her angagement and entered into an affair with Fitzgerald that was to last more than three years, until Dec. 21, 1940, when he died in her arms.         The years with Fitzgerald were, for Miss Graham, both idyllic and harrowing. The famed novelist was in failing health, fighting an epic and losing battle with alcoholism. He looked upon himself as a burned-out case, and he was having trouble turning out movie scripts to pay for his daughter's education and his wife Zelda's mental asylum bills.         But they were devoted to one another and Miss Graham gave him not only her love and patience but also a measure of peace of mind. She served as the model for Kathleen, the heroine in ''The Last Tycoon,'' the Fitzgerald novel that was unfinished at his death.         ''I was never a mistress,'' Miss Graham said. ''I was a woman who loved Scott Fitzgerald for better or worse until he died.'' War Correspondent in England         After his death Miss Graham returned to England as a war correspondent. It was there that she met, and married in 1941, Trevor Cresswell Lawrence Westbrook, an executive of the company that manufactured the Spitfire fighter plane. Before the marriage ended in divorce in 1946, they had two children, Wendy and Robert. A brief third marriage, in 1953, to a man she identified only as ''an American of Polish ancestry with an unpronounceable name,'' also ended in divorce.         Miss Graham resumed her Hollywood column after the war and, to earn as much money as she could, also wrote for magazines and conducted a radio show and a television show, ''Hollywood Today,'' in the mid-1950's. By 1964 Time magazine could report that Miss Graham had ''deposed Hopper and Parsons as doyenne of the Hollywood columnists,'' appearing in 178 newspapers, compared to about 100 for Miss Hopper and 69 for Miss Parsons.         Miss Graham also produced several more books, three of them centering on Fitzgerald - ''The Real Scott Fitzgerald,'' ''The Rest of the Story'' and ''College of One.'' That volume, published in 1967, after Miss Graham found the handwritten Fitzgerald ''curriculum'' he created for her, listed his favorite books and musical works that he insisted she become familiar with. Other Graham books included ''The Garden of Allah,'' ''Confessions of a Gossip Columnist'' and the steamy autobiographical novel ''A State of Heat'' (1972). She also published ''Hollywood Revisited'' in 1985.         Miss Graham is survived by her daughter, Wendy Fairey, who is dean of the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences at Brooklyn College; her son, Robert Westbrook, now living in Khania, Crete; and by three grandchildren. A memorial service will be held in New York next month.       
        Gwendolyn Cafritz, known as one of Washington's leading hostesses for several decades, died of cancer Tuesday at her home. She was 78 years old.         Gwendolyn Cafritz, known as one of Washington's leading hostesses for several decades, died of cancer Tuesday at her home. She was 78 years old.         Mrs. Cafritz gave elegant and lavish parties from the end of World War II until the early 1970s, when failing health curtailed her social schedule.         Her husband, Morris Cafritz, a millionare Washington real estate developer and businessman, died in 1964. After his death, she became president of the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation, which gave about $6 million a year to local organizations devoted to the arts, community service, health and education.         The Cafritz party guests ranged from the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, who once danced on a transparent dance floor lighted from below, to Supreme Court justices. President Harry Truman, however, favored Mrs. Cafritz's competitor, Perle Mesta.         Mrs. Cafritz, born in Budapest, Hungary, moved to Washington in the 1920's. In June 1986 she gave her last large party, which was described as a ''trip back into Washington social history.''         In 1969, four masked men broke into her mansion, bound and gagged Mrs. Cafritz and others, and escaped with more than $1 million in furs and jewelry.       
        Veronica Castang, an actress who performed on and Off Broadway, on television and in a film, died of ovarian cancer on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 50 years old.         Veronica Castang, an actress who performed on and Off Broadway, on television and in a film, died of ovarian cancer on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 50 years old.         Miss Castang made her Broadway debut in 1966 in ''How's the World Treating You?'' Her other New York plays included ''The National Health,'' ''Whose Life Is It, Anyway?'' ''Cloud 9'' and ''After the Prize.'' She often appeared in plays produced at the Phoenix Theater and the Manhattan Theater Club, including ''Sea Marks,'' a two-character play in which she also starred on television.         On television, Miss Castang starred in ''The Elephant Man''; in ''The Widowing of Mrs. Holyroyd''; in the PBS series ''Theater in America''; in the movie ''A Doctor's Story,'' which also starred Art Carney; as a guest on the sitcom ''Kate and Allie,'' and in episodes of the soap operas ''As the World Turns'' and ''All My Children.'' In a Drama by Howard Fast         In 1982, she played the American-born wife of David Ben-Gurion, the first Prime Minister of Israel, in the two-person drama ''David and Paula'' by Howard Fast, at the 92d Street Y. Richard F. Shepard called her performance brilliant. Writing in The New York Times, Mr. Shepard said Miss Castang ''expresses exactly the right degree of basic love, laced with exasperation, common sense and a strong will of her own.''         Miss Castang was a native of London and studied at the Sorbonne and at Questor's Theater in London.         She is survived by her stepfather, Clive Baker of London, and an aunt, Hilda Castang of Battle, England.

Gwendolyn Cafritz, a leading Washington hostess, died of cancer Tuesday at her home in the capital. She was 78 years old.         The widow of Morris Cafritz, a wealthy real estate entrepreneur, Mrs. Cafritz glittered on the capital's social scene in the 1950's and 1960's. As president of the Morris and Gwendolyn Cafritz Foundation, she oversaw annual contributions of about $6 million to local community and arts organizations.         Mrs. Cafritz combined wealth, effervescence and numerous contacts in business and government into a potent concoction of lavish entertainments that, in Washington, are as much a part of political life as sessions of Congress.         Initially, she competed with Pearl Mesta as Washington's premier hostess, the two vying to snare the most prominent guests. After Mrs. Mesta was appointed Ambassador to Luxembourg in 1949, Mrs. Cafritz undertook her campaign in earnest. A four-page account in Life magazine depicted her favorite summer soiree - one or two hundred guests, in evening dress, gathered for mint juleps and steaks on the barbecue in her backyard overlooking all of Washington.         She gave dozens of parties every year in her 57-room, white brick mansion on a seven-acre hilltop that included a basement night club with illuminated dance floor, a gym and an Olympic-size swimming pool. Vice Presidents, Cabinet members, Ambassadors, movie stars, Supreme Court Justices and heads of state played happily there over four administrations.         Born in Budapest, Mrs. Cafritz was the daughter of a Hungarian father and an American mother. She was a graduate of the University of Budapest. In the 1920's the family moved to Washington.         She met her husband in 1928 and they were married the next year. He died in 1964. In the early 1970's Mrs. Cafritz was forced to withdraw from the social scene because of poor health.         Surviving are three sons, Calvin, Carter and Conrad, all of Washington, and 13 grandchildren.
