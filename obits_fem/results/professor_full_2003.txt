         Rae Carlson, a psychologist who helped shape the study of personality with her 1971 paper ''Where Is the Person in Personality Research?'', died on Monday in Fairfax, Va. She was 76.         The cause was pneumonia, said her daughter Leslie Carlson-Soloway.         Dr. Carlson's paper was published at a time when personality researchers were primarily engaged in the study of mood, thinking and perception, conducting experiments that did not take the psychology of the individual test subjects into account.         Dr. Carlson called for a renewed emphasis on the study of individual lives, examined from a variety of angles.         She established the Society for Personology in 1982 to advance this research orientation. She also studied issues like altruism and political ideology, and wrote psychobiographical works on historical figures including Nathaniel Hawthorne and Karl Marx's daughter Eleanor.         In 1989, she received the Henry A. Murray Award, for the study of individual lives, from the American Psychological Association.         Dr. Carlson was a professor of psychology at Rutgers University, retiring in 1996. She received her Ph.D. in psychology from the University of Michigan in 1958.         Rae Stahl Carlson was born in Valentine, Neb. She lived for 25 years in Princeton, N.J., and was a resident of Fairfax at the time of her death. In addition to her daughter Leslie, of Santa Fe, N.M., Dr. Carlson is survived by her daughter Tracy Carlson of Oakton, Va., and four grandchildren.       
         Dr. Eleanor J. Gibson, a psychology professor at Cornell who made advances in the study of perception and learning processes in children, died on Dec. 30 in Columbia, S.C. She was 92.         Photographs of the ''visual cliff,'' a device she developed to study depth perception in infants and toddlers, are still included in some psychology textbooks.         Dr. Gibson, then working as a research associate at Cornell, and Dr. Richard Walk used the simulated cliff in tests to show that babies could visually distinguish depth.         The cliff was ''a wooden table from the edge of which strong plate glass extended,'' Life magazine reported in 1959.         ''Children were put on the table top and coaxed to crawl out over the glass,'' the magazine said. ''But when they got to the edge of the cliff and looked down almost all of them quickly withdrew. Even their mothers' most persuasive urgings could not get them out.''         Similar studies were done with animals, including rats and kittens.         The findings indicated that perception is an essentially adaptive process, or as Dr. Gibson put it, ''We perceive to learn, as well as learn to perceive.''         Dr. Gibson also did pioneering work in the relationship of perception and reading.         Eleanor Jack was born in Peoria, Ill. She received her bachelor's degree from Smith in 1931 and her master's degree in 1933. She earned her doctorate in psychology at Yale in 1938.         Her marriage in 1932 to Dr. James J. Gibson, a psychology professor who also conducted research on perception, was both a help and a hindrance to her career.         They collaborated occasionally, but when he joined the faculty of Cornell in 1949, she was unable to secure a teaching post there because of anti-nepotism rules, which were common in universities. So she worked as a research associate at Cornell.         In 1965, after the rules changed, she was appointed to an endowed chair as a professor of psychology, and the Gibsons became one of the first married couples in a single department at the university.         She also held academic appointments at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences in Palo Alto, Calif.; the Massachusetts Institute of Technology; the Universities of Minnesota, South Carolina, Pennsylvania and Connecticut; Emory and the Salk Institute.         In 1982, she was invited to Beijing to teach Chinese psychologists about recent theories and techniques of research.         Dr. Gibson was the author of five books, including the memoir ''Perceiving the Affordances: A Portrait of Two Psychologists,'' published in 2001.         Recently, Dr. Gibson lived in Columbia.         Her husband died in 1979. She is survived by a son, James J., also of Columbia; a daughter, Jean Rosenberg of Middlebury, Vt.; a sister, Emily Jack of Washington; and three grandchildren.         Correction:  January 8, 2003, Wednesday  An obituary on Saturday about Dr. Eleanor J. Gibson, a psychology professor at Cornell who was a pioneer in perception studies, misstated the number of her grandchildren and referred incompletely to her residence. She had four grandchildren, not three. In recent years, she spent time in Middlebury, Vt., in addition to Columbia, S.C.       
         Yayori Matsui, a journalist and campaigner for the rights of Asian women, died on Dec. 27 at a Tokyo hospital. She was 68 and a resident of Tokyo.         The cause was liver cancer, said an associate, Norma Field, professor of Japanese studies at the University of Chicago. Dr. Field said Ms. Matsui had reported her illness in a message to her associates in which she also outlined her ideas for a projected Women's Museum of War and Peace.         Ms. Matsui was the founder, in 1998, of the Violence Against Women in War-Network, Japan. It was a principal sponsor of the Women's International War Crimes Trial held in Tokyo in 2000.         A symbolic trial, it found Emperor Hirohito ultimately responsible for the policy by which the Japanese military forced Asian women into sexual slavery during World War II. It convicted other wartime leaders individually of crimes against humanity for their part in what was euphemistically called the ''comfort women'' system.         Ms. Matsui was in the forefront of efforts to make Japanese school textbooks deal more openly with the realities of World War II. She traveled widely, writing and speaking about women as the victims of armed conflicts and social injustices.         She was born in Kyoto. Her parents, both Christian missionaries, moved to Tokyo after the war to build the Yamate Christian Church in the devastated capital. Ms. Matsui's funeral was held there Monday, according to Margaret Mitsutani, a member of her Violence Against Women group in Tokyo.         She said Ms. Matsui was survived by her parents and five siblings.         Ms. Matsui worked for Asahi Shimbun, one of Japan's leading newspapers, for 30 years, starting in the early 1960's. She reported from Singapore, worked as a senior staff writer and contributed articles on the environment, Asian affairs and women's issues.         In 1976 she founded Asian Women in Solidarity, a grass-roots organization that grew out of opposition to ''sex tourism'' conducted for well-heeled visitors to Asia. This in turn led to the establishment in 1995 of the Asia-Japan Women's Resource Center in Tokyo, which researches women's issues, publishes a magazine, conducts seminars and sponsors lectures by Asian feminists.         She was the author of ''Women in New Asia: From Pain to Power,'' published in Britain in 2000 and distributed here by St. Martin's Press. The Women's Museum, tentatively set to open in Tokyo in 2006, is to include a library and video archive documenting the fate of ''comfort women'' and violence against women in conflicts around the world.         According to Ms. Mitsutani, Ms. Matsui was in Afghanistan meeting with Afghan feminists in October when her illness overtook her. She returned to Tokyo where she worked on plans for the women's museum.       
         Jean Kerr, whose wry wit and unerring eye for life's everyday absurdities kept legions of readers and theatergoers laughing with books like ''Please Don't Eat the Daisies'' and plays like ''Mary, Mary,'' died on Sunday in White Plains. She was 80.         The apparent cause was pneumonia, her son Christopher said. She was in White Plains Hospital and lived nearby in Larchmont, N.Y., also in Westchester County.         Mrs. Kerr, who was the widow of the drama critic Walter Kerr, was well acquainted with the glamour, grit and egocentric follies of life in the theater and capitalized on that experience. She wrote entertainingly and often about show business, musing about what to say when lunching with a prospective producer (order a drink, so you look relaxed, but don't touch it lest he think you're an alcoholic), or gloomily anticipating negative reviews of her latest work (''If I have to commit suicide, I have nothing but Gelusil'').         But she also had an unquestioned gift for finding the comic in the commonplace anxieties of suburbia and married life. She cheerfully acknowledged doing most of her writing in the family car, parked several blocks away from the scrambling chaos of several children and pets (''There is nothing to do but write, after I get the glove compartment tidied up'').         The Kerrs made their debut as a team on Broadway in 1946 with ''Song of Bernadette,'' a dramatization of Franz Werfel's novel about a young Frenchwoman who was canonized after saying she had seen visions of the Virgin Mary in a grotto near Lourdes. It was not a success, nor was her solo writing effort two years later, a comedy called ''Jenny Kissed Me,'' about a priest who finds his household disrupted by the arrival of his housekeeper's niece.         Jean and Walter Kerr teamed up again in 1949 with ''Touch and Go,'' a revue for which they wrote the sketches and lyrics and which Mr. Kerr directed. The show was a hit, with sketches ranging from ''Hamlet'' performed as a musical comedy to a location rehearsal for a film sequence in which one of the characters, a trained ape, turns out to be smarter than the glamorous actress who is the star of the film. Brooks Atkinson, writing in The New York Times,praised the Kerrs' ''breezy and informed wit'' and hailed the show as the best of the season.         After contributing some sketches to another revue, ''John Murray Anderson's Almanac,'' in 1953, Mrs. Kerr joined forces to write ''King of Hearts'' with Eleanor Brooke. Starring Donald Cooke, Jackie Cooper and Cloris Leachman, and staged by Mr. Kerr, the 1954 comedy about a comic-strip artist and his love-struck secretary was well received.         Mrs. Kerr scored her first big success outside the theater with the publication in 1957 of ''Please Don't Eat the Daisies,'' a witty and wide-ranging collection of pieces about everything from the pet dogs in her life to the oddities of the Kerrs' house in Larchmont, which boasted a two-story fireplace and a carillon that played the duet from ''Carmen.'' The book became a best seller and then a movie in 1960, with David Niven and Doris Day. It became a television situation comedy as well, and ran on NBC from 1965 to 1967.         The Kerrs returned to Broadway in 1958 with their musical comedy ''Goldilocks,'' staged by Mr. Kerr, with music by Leroy Anderson, lyrics by the Kerrs and Joan Ford, and choreography by Agnes de Mille. The show closed after a mercifully brief run, and the Kerrs made a mutual vow never to mention its name again.         Mrs. Kerr went on to take Broadway by storm in 1961 with ''Mary, Mary,'' a comedy about a divorced couple who seem headed for new and misguided relationships until they discover that they still love each other. Barbara Bel Geddes played the title character, Barry Nelson her stubbornly obtuse former spouse, with Betsy von Furstenberg and Michael Rennie as the handsome troublemakers. The Times's critic, Howard Taubman, gave the show a mixed review.         Nevertheless, audiences packed the theater nightly and ''Mary, Mary'' became one of the longest-running productions of the decade. Its 1963 screen adaptation, was directed by Mervyn LeRoy with Debbie Reynolds and Barry Nelson. Meanwhile, the original show was still on Broadway, with more than 1,500 performances in all.         Jean Collins Kerr was born in Scranton, Pa., on July 10, 1922. She attended Marywood Seminary and Marywood College in Scranton and acquired a taste for theater while still a student. She was serving as stage manager of a college production of ''Romeo and Juliet'' when she met Mr. Kerr, then a professor of drama at Catholic University in Washington. Shortly after earning her bachelor's degree at Marywood, she married and received a master's degree from Catholic University in 1945.         Her self-deprecating humor was amply evident in her other published work. She also wrote ''The Snake Has All the Lines'' (1960), ''Penny Candy'' (1970) and ''How I Got to Be Perfect'' (1978), collections of humorous essays.         Her family was a rich source of comic inspiration, a minefield of the unexpected that demanded resilience and a gift for improvisation. In addition to Christopher, who lives in Manhattan, Mrs. Kerr is survived by her sons Colin of Port Jefferson, N.Y., John of Portland, Me., Gregory of Coopersburg, Pa., and Gilbert of Ponte Vedra Beach, Fla.; her daughter, Kitty of Arlington, Mass.; her brothers Hugh Collins of Meriden, Conn., and Frank Collins of Ardmore, Pa., and 11 granchildren.         Mr. Kerr, whose long career embraced teaching, playwriting, directing and theater criticism -- first for The New York Herald Tribune and then for The Times -- died in 1996 at 83.         A tall, handsome woman with a ready smile, Mrs. Kerr never took herself too seriously. ''I'm not a natural playwright at all,'' she told an interviewer. ''I write what I know.'' There were those who felt she drew water from the same well too often. Phyllis Theroux, writing about ''How I Got to Be Perfect'' in The New York Times Sunday Book Review, noted that ''beneath her cleverness lies a sizable literary talent'' waiting to be aired.         Mrs. Kerr returned to the theater in 1964 with ''Poor Richard,'' a coolly reviewed romantic comedy.         Nearly 10 years passed before her next appearance on Broadway, with another romantic comedy, ''Finishing Touches'' (1973).         The 1980 comedy ''Lunch Hour'' turned out to be Mrs. Kerr's farewell to the theater. Set in the Hamptons and directed by Mike Nichols, the play starred Sam Waterston and Gilda Radner.         For all her experience and success in the theater, Mrs. Kerr never stopped worrying about how her work would be received.         She regarded opening night as ''a public hanging, and you're the hanged.'' She once said, ''I think if you can write a play or produce a play,'' the first step toward success has been made, if ''people don't want to kill themselves in the lobby.'' Then came the inimitable extra twist of Kerr: ''Now there must be four or five other steps, but that's the first.''       
         Noriko Sawada Bridges Flynn, a writer and civil rights worker who managed to transcend the struggle between management and labor in her personal and professional life, died on Feb. 7 at her home in Pescadero, Calif. She was 79.         Her first marriage, to Harry Bridges, the fiery Marxist leader of the West Coast longshoremen's union, required a change in legislation. After his death more than three decades later, she married Ed Flynn, president of a Pacific shippers association, who had long skirmished with Mr. Bridges across bargaining tables and picket lines.         For half a century, Ms. Flynn worked for union rights, fair treatment of immigrants and racial and sexual equality but was best known for her contrasting marriages.         Her first wedding, planned as an elopement, was initially thwarted by a Nevada law forbidding marriage between whites and Asians. She was the American-born daughter of Japanese immigrants, and Mr. Bridges was an immigrant from Australia. Friends said Ms. Flynn had a wicked sense of humor. She married Mr. Flynn, the shipping boss, on May Day, the international socialist holiday.         Ms. Flynn grew up on rented land near Los Angeles, where her parents grew fruit and vegetables. Beginning in 1942, when the government ordered the internment of Japanese-Americans on the West Coast, the family spent three years in a desert camp in Arizona. After the war, she moved to the San Francisco area, where for 12 years she was a secretary for Charles Garry, a lawyer whose clients included leading political dissidents and radicals. Mr. Garry introduced her to Mr. Bridges.         As Ms. Flynn described that first meeting to Robert Cherny, a history professor at San Francisco State University who is working on a biography of Mr. Bridges, her future husband was quite drunk. ''Where have you been?'' he mumbled. She replied, ''You mean, as in all your life?''         A relationship ensued and in December 1958, the couple drove to Reno for what they hoped would be a quiet and private wedding.         However, when Mr. Bridges, 58, and Ms. Sawada, 35, asked for a marriage license, the clerk explained that an 1846 law prohibited marriages between whites and Asians. Mr. Bridges protested, saying that his bride was an American, born in the United States, while he was the foreigner.         News accounts quoted the clerk as saying, ''It's not a matter of where you were born. It's the blood. It's against the law here.''         Mr. Bridges quickly took his case to the national press. Within four days lawyers for the couple succeeded in having the law struck down. The two obtained their license and were married in Reno.         For the next 32 years, until Mr. Bridges died in 1990, they were one of San Francisco's most prominent couples. She resumed the studies interrupted by her internment and wrote articles about her childhood for several national magazines. She was also at her husband's side in the 1970's when he stepped up his union's battle with the shippers for guarantees of job security.         In that bitter struggle, Mr. Bridges's major adversary was Ed Flynn, president of the Pacific Maritime Association. In 1971 a strike by Mr. Bridges's union shut down all 56 Pacific ports. But the two men liked and respected each other and understood each other's positions, Mr. Cherny said. He said they would battle in negotiations and then go out for dinner with their wives.         After they both retired, they continued to see each other. And after Harry Bridges's death, his widow kept in touch with his old opponent, who had become a widower. They married in 1994.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Flynn is survived by a daughter, Katherine Bridges Wiggins of Bandon, Ore., and two stepchildren, Robert Bridges of Fremont, Calif., and Marie Shell of San Francisco.       
         Anne Logan Davis Wichern, a lung specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center and professor emeritus at New York University who established one of the country's first emphysema clinics, died March 9. She was 78 and lived on the Upper East Side.         The cause was cancer, her family said, and she died at the Columbia-Presbyterian Center of New York-Presbyterian Hospital.         Dr. Davis, as she was known professionally, was a pioneer in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases. She founded the emphysema unit at Bellevue in 1956 and remained its director until two years ago, when it was merged into the hospital's chest and asthma units.         She was associated with Bellevue since she started her internship there in 1949. An authority in pulmonary critical care, she formally retired in December as an attending physician at the hospital.         She directed the Bellevue chest clinic from 1987 to 1992, overseeing some 6,000 patient visits every year. Through the 1970's and 1980's, she also was a physician and consultant at the Veterans Administration Hospital in Manhattan.         She started her academic career as an instructor at the Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons in 1957, rising to assistant professor of medicine in 1968. That year, she accepted an associate professorship with permanent tenure at the New York University School of Medicine, from which she retired in December.         Anne Logan Davis was born in Rahway, N.J., and graduated from Wellesley College in 1945 and received her medical degree at Columbia in 1949. She decided to specialize in chest and pediatric pulmonary medicine while a resident at Bellevue in the 1950's, after recovering from tuberculosis contracted during her internship.         From experience, she found that in a busy municipal hospital the special needs of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary illnesses tended to receive short shrift. She was given the opportunity to organize the emphysema clinic to deal comprehensively with the patients' medical, social and economic conditions, and to undertake a systematic study and record of their progress.         Dr. Davis is survived by her husband of 47 years, Dr. Walter Adam Wichern Jr., chairman emeritus of surgery at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center; a son, Walter A. III, and a daughter, A. Logan Wichern, both of Manhattan; and a sister, Carol Goodman of Morristown, N.J.       
         Amanda Davis, a promising writer whose first novel appeared in bookstores on Feb. 18, died on Friday when the small plane that was taking her on a publicity tour crashed into a mountain 18 miles from Asheville, N.C. She was 32 and lived in Oakland, Calif.         Her father, Dr. James Davis, who was piloting the plane, a Cessna 177 Cardinal, and her mother, Francie Davis, both of Setauket, N.Y., were also killed.         Her novel, ''Wonder When You'll Miss Me,'' was published by William Morrow. In its first-person narrative a young woman, Faith Duckle, makes a difficult journey from schoolyard outcast to trapeze artist in a circus. Ms. Davis traveled with a circus to do research for the book.         Her other writings include ''Circling the Drain'' (1999, Morrow/Avon), a collection of 15 short stories, mostly concerning young women dealing with loss.         When she died, she was an assistant professor at Mills College, in Oakland, where she taught fiction-writing to undergraduates and graduate students. She received a bachelor's degree in theater from Wesleyan University in Middletown, Conn., and a master's degree in fiction from Brooklyn College.         Her father, who was 63, was chairman of the neurology department at Stony Brook University Medical School in Stony Brook, N.Y. Her mother, 59, was an assistant professor and the chief librarian at Dowling College in Oakdale, N.Y.         Ms. Davis was born in Durham, N.C., her family's longtime hometown.         She is survived by a sister, Joanna Maure Davis, of San Francisco, and a brother, Adam, of Lancaster, Pa.       
         Erika Fromm, an emeritus professor of psychology at the University of Chicago and an expert on the use of hypnosis in therapy, died on Monday at her home in Chicago. She was 93.         Dr. Fromm considered hypnosis a valuable analytical tool that, when used by a skilled practitioner, could provide access to a patient's unconscious conflicts and desires. She said hypnosis could induce an altered state of consciousness involving heightened awareness and focus in approximately 1 in 12 people.         She used hypnosis to treat severely disturbed patients as well as victims of incest and those suffering from post-traumatic stress disorders. She also advocated self-hypnosis as a path to self-exploration.         In the 1980's, Dr. Fromm joined the growing field of behavioral medicine, which uses hypnosis, meditation, biofeedback and other techniques to treat physical ailments. Her book ''Hypnosis and Behavioral Medicine,'' written with Dr. Daniel P. Brown and published in 1987, presented research supporting those methods in treating allergies, asthma, migraines and hypertension.         She was the longtime editor of the journal Research Developments and Perspectives in Hypnosis. Her books include ''Dream Interpretation: A New Approach'' (1964), written with Dr. Thomas French; ''Hypnotherapy and Hypnoanalysis'' (1986), written with Dr. Brown; and ''Self-Hypnosis: The Chicago Paradigm'' (1990), written with Dr. Stephen Kahn. Her final book, ''Changes in the Therapist'' (2000), also written with Dr. Kahn, looked at the impact that patients can have on their therapists.         Born Erika Oppenheimer in Frankfurt, Germany, on Dec. 23, 1909, she received her doctorate in psychology from the University of Frankfurt in 1933. Alarmed by Nazism, she moved to the Netherlands that year and to the United States in 1938. She was a research assistant in psychiatry at the University of Chicago from 1939 to 1940, then spent years in practice and joined the university's faculty in 1961.         Her husband was Paul Fromm, a cousin of the psychoanalyst Erich Fromm and the founder of the Fromm Music Foundation at Harvard, which supports contemporary composers. He died in 1987. Her daughter, Joan Fromm Greenstone, died in 1996. She is survived by a sister, Clementina Kro of Israel; three brothers, Walter Oppenheimer of Germany, Asher Oppenheimer of Israel and John Ormond of Piedmont, Calif.; two grandsons; and two great-grandsons.       
         Dorothy Nelkin, a New York University sociologist who chronicled the uneasy relationship between science and society, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 69.         The cause was cancer, the university said.         Professor Nelkin, a prolific author who began her research at Cornell in 1963, was a close observer of science and how it is perceived -- and, often, misperceived -- by the public.         As a practical matter, that often involved giving warnings about the potential dangers posed by scientific advances that proceed unchecked by careful discussion of their implications. In an interview last year, she said it was hardly surprising that many nonscientists were unnerved by the commercialization of the human body, as scientists seek patents for genes and tissues.         ''If you are looking at the public image of the mad scientist or the scientist out of control,'' she said, ''the issue of patenting has aroused a lot of concerns. The public concern doesn't just come out of space. It comes out of real things that are happening.''         But Professor Nelkin, whose husband of 50 years, Mark Nelkin, is a physicist, was no enemy of science. Although her academic background was in the humanities and the social sciences, she was generally comfortable in the world of science, especially biology. Still, she kept her intellectual distance, believing that lay writers often had a tendency to lionize science.         ''She always saw science in relationship to society, and she never went native,'' said Prof. Troy Duster, a sociologist at N.Y.U.         Dorothy Wolfers Nelkin was born on July 30, 1933, in Boston and raised in Brookline, Mass. She earned her bachelor's degree at Cornell, where she met her husband. In addition to Mr. Nelkin, she is survived by a daughter, Lisa Nelkin of Baltimore; a sister, Nancy Wolfers of London; and a granddaughter.         Although she never earned more than a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Cornell, Professor Nelkin rose to hold one of N.Y.U.'s highest ranks, university professor.         She wrote or co-wrote 26 books, including ''Selling Science: How the Press Covers Science and Technology,'' ''The DNA Mystique: The Gene as a Cultural Icon'' and ''Body Bazaar: The Market for Human Tissue in the Biotechnology Age.'' She also served as an adviser to the federal government's Human Genome Project. She was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1983.         Much of her work focused on the friction between science and technology and the public. In the early years, she might have looked at how the location for a nuclear plant was chosen or workers' attitudes toward their safety. Over the past decade, though, her focus narrowed on DNA breakthroughs and their effect on the public. She recently began exploring the aesthetic of DNA, and its increasing depiction in art and popular culture.         The goal, colleagues said, was to lend perspective to a public alternately smitten and scared by scientific advances.         Professor Nelkin believed that the science would be unable to live up to the hopes floated by its promoters, many of whom stood to make a lot of money.         She worried, too, about the civil liberties issues raised by efforts to amass databases of people's DNA for crime-fighting purposes. And she was a firm skeptic about efforts to link behavior, especially criminal behavior, to heredity.         ''By making social factors irrelevant,'' she wrote, ''genetic explanations of crime provide convenient excuses for those seeking to dismantle the welfare state.''       
         Leela Chitnis, an actress whose half-century-long 40-film career in India progressed from romantic roles to the motherly ones for which she is best remembered, died on Monday at a hospital in Danbury, Conn. She was 93. She had been living in Connecticut for many years to be near her family.         Ms. Chitnis began her acting career onstage at a time women seldom worked as actors. Her son Manavedra Chitnis said that women who did act were regarded as prostitutes, and so Ms. Chitnis was shunned by Brahmans, the priestly caste of which she was a member.         She did not care, her son said, nor was she abashed by these prejudices when she moved on, in the 1930's, to India's large and lively movie industry in Bombay, now known as Bollywood. She began playing romantic leads and became one of the best-known heroines in the country.         From 1948 into the 1980's, she worked as a character actor, becoming famous in the 1950's and 60's for her portrayals of mothers. In these roles, she developed an image of sober probity, underlined by gold-rimmed glasses and white saris.         ''Whenever I think of her, I still shake with awe,'' said Jyotirmoy Datta, the senior arts editor for News-India Times, an English-language weekly published in New York. ''She seemed to be always right and prepared to follow the straight path of virtue.''         In a review of her work in 1997 in India-West magazine, published in Emeryville, Calif., R. M. Vijayakar called Ms. Chitnis the Duchess of Depression, not least because of her characteristic cough.         ''If she appeared on screen it was to cough consumptively, gobble spoonfuls of syrup from bottles perched so precariously on bedside tables that they overturned and crashed to the floor when there was no money to buy another,'' he wrote.         Ms. Chitnis was born on Sept. 9, 1909, in a small town near Bombay. Her father was an English professor who adhered to Brahmo Samaj, a religious movement that rejected caste.         She married a much older man at 15 or 16, and quickly had four children. The couple supported India's struggle for independence from Britain and once risked arrest by harboring Manabendra Nath Roy, a Marxist freedom fighter.         After they divorced, she worked as a schoolteacher and began acting onstage in melodramas typical of the time. She appeared in several movies, and went through a Bombay university in order to be hired by a major studio, Bombay Talkies; it hired only college graduates.         She soon made three hit films -- ''Kangan,'' ''Bandhan'' and ''Jhoola'' -- with Ashok Kumar, who became one of India's top male stars. In a much-remembered scene in ''Kangan'' (1939), she overhears the playwright with whom she is in love declaring his love to another woman -- unaware that he is reading lines from his latest play. The Hindustan Times, in its obituary, said her acting in the movie ''epitomized rustic beauty in mainstream Hindi cinema.''         Ms. Chitnis began playing mothers in 1948 with the patriotic film ''Shaheed.'' Her best known maternal role, according to The Hindustan Times, was in ''Awaara'' (1951), in which she is deserted by her husband for suspected infidelity.         Her last movie was ''Dil Tujhko Diya,'' in 1985.         For older Indians, Ms. Chitnis is remembered as the first Indian movie star to endorse Lux soap, in 1941. Foreign celebrities had previously been the ones to endorse this and other consumer products.         In addition to her son Manavendra, Ms. Chitnis is survived by her sons Benoy and Raj, and by three grandchildren.       
         Frances Stevens Reese, a founder and chairwoman emeritus of the environmental group Scenic Hudson and a veteran of the fight to keep a power plant from being built on Storm King Mountain, died last Wednesday in Valhalla, N.Y. She was 85 and lived in Hughsonville, a village in Dutchess County, N.Y.         She was fatally injured in a car accident on Wednesday on Route 9 near Cold Spring when her driver lost control of the car and struck a utility pole, according to the Putnam County sheriff's office. The driver, Pedro S. Arce, 48, of Hughsonville, survived with lesser injuries.         To members of her organization and to many Hudson River preservationists, she was known as the grande dame of the Hudson Valley.         Franny Reese, as she was known, was a spark plug in a movement that began 40 years ago with a handful of local gentry who sought to check the unbridled development of the Hudson River Valley.         Their immediate cause was to forestall a projected dig for the world's largest hydroelectric power plant, which would have forever changed the dramatic face of Storm King Mountain, looming above the Hudson in Orange County. Her little band won legal standing in 1965 to take on the Federal Power Commission and the developer, Consolidated Edison.         The movement became today's Scenic Hudson, a potent force in the national environmental movement. It was the group's victory in the Storm King case that established the principle that citizens could intervene in court cases affecting the environment even if those individuals were not in danger of sustaining damages to their properties.         The Storm King fight was the first in which a group of such citizens was granted court access in a site-licensing decision. Language derived from that precedent was incorporated into the 1969 National Environmental Policy Act, which established the Environmental Protection Agency and mandated environmental impact studies for such construction projects. Scenic Hudson helped secure passage of other important legislation, like the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the 1980 Superfund Law.         Mrs. Reese remained a mainstay of Scenic Hudson as it helped create dozens of riverfront parks and preserves from Manhattan north to the foothills of the Adirondacks.         As chairwoman from 1966 to 1984, she also oversaw the group's legal and educational work. She attended board meetings until her death and remained cheerfully active as a strategist for policy and litigation, a liaison to state and federal governments and one of the organization's leading fund-raisers.         Frances Stevens was born in Manhattan. She attended Barnard College, majoring in playwriting and English, and Yale Art School. In 1937, she married Willis Livingston Meier Reese, who shared her interests in conservation and historical preservation in the Hudson Valley.         Mrs. Reese was a longtime trustee and benefactor of Marist College.         Her husband, who was a Charles Evans Hughes Professor of Law at Columbia, died in 1990. She is survived by a daughter, Frances R. Olivieri of Manhattan; three sons, John R., of Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y., George B., of Manhattan, and Alexander S., of Hughsonville; six grandchildren; and six great-grandchildren.       
         Patricia S. Goldman-Rakic, a professor of neuroscience at Yale University whose pioneering research on brain and memory functions helped pave the way for understanding schizophrenia and Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, died last Thursday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. She was 66 and lived in New Haven.         She died of complications from head and other injuries suffered last Tuesday when she was struck by a car as she crossed a street in Hamden, Conn., said her husband, Dr. Pasko Rakic, a fellow neuroscientist at Yale.         ''Pat Goldman-Rakic was one of the most distinguished neuroscientists of her generation,'' said Richard C. Levin, Yale's president. ''We grieve her tragic loss in the knowledge that her important contributions will live on.''         Dr. Goldman-Rakic was the first researcher to chart the frontal lobe of the brain, the executive center responsible for personality, reasoning, planning, insight and other high-order cognitive functions. Located behind the forehead, the frontal lobe was once regarded as inaccessible to rigorous scientific analysis. But Dr. Goldman-Rakic used various techniques -- drugs, electrical impulses, behavioral responses and other methods -- to explore and describe its structure.         Among her discoveries, colleagues said, was the demonstration that certain cells in the prefrontal cortex are dedicated to specific memory tasks. One example is the short-term memory that operates when a person dials a phone number or solves a math problem. Like the random-access memory of a computer chip, the mind's ''working memory'' apparently retrieves the data from other regions of the brain, retaining it for as long as necessary and then storing it away as the attention shifts to a new task.         In a 1995 interview with Daniel Goleman of The New York Times, Dr. Goldman-Rakic said that short-term memory appeared to hold vital clues to what goes wrong in the thinking of people with schizophrenia. ''The bizarre thought disorders in schizophrenia, especially the inability to keep a train of thought from being derailed, could be due to a defect in working memory,'' she noted.         In the 1970's, Dr. Goldman-Rakic discovered that the loss of dopamine in the prefrontal cortex led to memory deficits. That study changed neuropsychiatry by providing doctors with insights into the symptoms of mental illness and the effectiveness of psychoactive medications.         Her more recent research showed how amphetamine abuse in adolescence or early adulthood could diminish the mind's performance for years and perhaps permanently. Colleagues said that her work on memory, behavior and drugs had provided a foundation for understanding and treating schizophrenia, Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases and attention-deficit disorders.         Patricia S. Goldman was born in Salem, Mass., on April 22, 1937. She earned a bachelor's degree at Vassar College in 1959 and a doctorate at the University of California at Los Angeles in 1963. After years of research at U.C.L.A., New York University, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the National Institutes of Health, she joined the Yale faculty in 1979.         While she taught some classes, she concentrated on research at Yale, Dr. Rakic said. She wrote or collaborated on hundreds of scientific papers, and was the recipient of many awards for her work. She was elected to the National Academy of Sciences in 1990, and held honorary degrees from the University of Utrecht in the Netherlands and the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.         Besides her husband, whom she married in 1979, she is survived by a sister, Dr. Ruth Rappaport, of Radnor, Pa.       
         Mary Viscountess Eccles, a bibliophile who built up what is widely considered the world's finest collection of rare books and manuscripts relating to Samuel Johnson and his biographer and friend, James Boswell, died on Aug. 26 at her home, Four Oakes Farm, in Somerset County, N.J. She was 91.         Lady Eccles, the American widow of Viscount Eccles, a British politician, businessman and bibliophile who once headed the British Library in London, was first drawn to the world of the Elizabethan theater but later switched her interest and the focus of her collecting to Johnson and Boswell and their circle.         She and her first husband, Donald Frizell Hyde, a New York lawyer, acquired thousands of books and manuscripts relating to these two towering literary figures of the 18th century.         Treasures stored in the huge fireproof library they built at Four Oakes Farm include about 800 letters from Johnson -- about 80 percent of all those known to have survived -- as well as works and papers from the important A. Edward Newton collection of Johnson material, which Lady Eccles, then Mary Hyde, acquired around 1940.         The library also houses the Johnson material from the collection of James Boswell's papers found at Malahide Castle in Ireland, which she bought from the American collector Col. Ralph H. Isham at the end of World War II; Boswell's guestbook from his home at Auchinleck, Scotland; Johnson's diaries for the years 1765 to about 1784; the private journal of Hester Thrale, Johnson's great friend and benefactor; and a collection known as the R. B. Adam Library Relating to Dr. Samuel Johnson and His Era, which she bought from the Adam family of Buffalo in 1948, and which was then regarded as the best in existence.         Under the name Mary Hyde, she also wrote a number of books about her interests. In 1949, Columbia University published her doctoral thesis, ''Playwriting for Elizabethans, 1600-1605.'' In 1958 she, her first husband and E. J. McAdam Jr. edited Volume I of the Yale edition of the works of Samuel Johnson, ''Diaries, Prayers and Annals.''         In 1972 she published ''The Impossible Friendship: Boswell and Mrs. Thrale'' (Harvard), a study of Boswell's relationship with the woman who befriended Johnson. This was followed in 1975 by ''The Thrales of Streatham Park'' (Harvard), an account of Mrs. Thrale and her family.         She was awarded honorary degrees by American and British universities, including Brown, the University of Birmingham (England), the University of Massachusetts and Union College.         She was the first woman elected to the Roxburghe Club, an English association of bibliophiles, and one of the first to join the Grolier Club, another bibliophile's group, in New York City; she was vice president from 1982 to 1992.         Lady Eccles financed her collecting largely from her own family fortune. She was born Mary Morley Crapo in Detroit on July 12 1912. Her family name was derived from crapaud, the French for toad, which had been the name bestowed by Cape Cod natives on a French ancestor of hers who washed up there in 1680. But the family prospered, becoming rich from interests in cement, barges and timber, and that allowed Lady Eccles to indulge her passion for book collecting.         She earned a bachelor's degree at Vassar in 1934, a master's from Columbia in 1935 and a doctorate there in 1945. In 1939 she married Mr. Hyde, and in 1943 they bought Four Oakes Farm, which was her home for the rest of her life.         Lady Eccles described in an essay first published in The Vassar Alumnae Magazine in 1960 how she and Mr. Hyde were drawn to book collecting when they visited a rare book exhibition in Detroit and realized for the first time that books of this kind were not all locked up in libraries but available for purchase.         They also learned some of the risks. The three Shakespeare quartos they bought on that occasion turned out to be defective, Lady Eccles wrote, while a document with the purported signature of Queen Elizabeth I proved to be a fake.         From time to time Lady Eccles encountered resistance to her large-scale purchases of remaining Johnson and Boswell memorabilia in Britain. She had trouble with a patriotic Scottish customs officer when she took five trunks of Boswell papers from Colonel Isham's collection aboard the Queen Mary at Southampton. In 1968, Hugh Mainwaring, who owned the journal Mrs. Thrale kept from 1766 to 1778, refused to sell her the manuscript privately, though she subsequently got it at a Sotheby's auction.         Her first husband died in 1966. In 1984 she married Lord Eccles, who died in 1999. She is survived by two stepsons and a stepdaughter, all of whom live in England: Viscount Eccles of Mowlton, Yorkshire; Simon Eccles of London; and Polly Landsdown of Great Coxwell, Oxfordshire.         Correction:  September 9, 2003, Tuesday  An obituary on Aug. 30 about Mary Viscountess Eccles, a leading bibliophile and collector of material on Samuel Johnson, misspelled part of the name of her home in Somerset County, N.J., where she died. It is Four Oaks Farm, not Oakes.         Correction:  September 25, 2003, Thursday  An obituary on Aug. 30 about Mary Viscountess Eccles, a leading bibliophile and collector of material on Samuel Johnson, misstated the name of the New York University professor who collaborated with her and her first husband in editing a volume of Johnson's works. He was E. L. McAdam Jr., not E. J.       
         Laura Rapaport Borsten, who was in the first group of 40 recruits accepted to be a Wave, a member of the women's Navy corps, died on Aug. 11 at a hospital in Los Angeles. She was 91.         Her husband, Orin, said Mrs. Borsten, who lived in Los Angeles, kept up with other veterans and believed she was the last surviving member of the first group, made up of officer trainees.         Lt. Billy Ray Davis, a Navy spokesman, confirmed that Mrs. Borsten, then Laura Rapaport, joined as one of the first 40 Waves on Aug. 28, 1942. She rose to the rank of lieutenant commander.         President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed the law creating the Women's Reserve of the Navy on July 30, 1942. The corps was soon christened Waves, for Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service. Capt. Mildred McAfee, first director of the corps, suggested that it really meant ''Women Are Very Essential Sometimes.''         Organized to allow more men to be available for combat, women soon filled jobs like repairing aircraft, breaking enemy codes and serving as gunnery instructors. Many did clerical work.         Before the Waves, neither the women who served in World War I nor Navy nurses were permitted to become officers. Mrs. Borsten and her fellow officer trainees were greeted by newsreel cameras and autograph hunters when they reported for training at Smith College in Northampton, Mass.         By the end of the war, there were 8,000 Wave officers and 76,000 enlisted Waves. Though the name Wave was dropped in 1972, Navy women have gone on to command battleships and fighter squadrons, and rise to the rank of three-star admiral.         But they presented challenges to military tradition. For example, Miss McAfee decreed that Waves would be allowed to wear enough makeup ''to look human.''         Laura Golde Rapaport was born on a farm in McIntosh County, N.D., on Feb. 29, 1912.         She graduated from the University of Minnesota with honors in library science. Just as she was starting a job in adult education, Leo W. Schwarz, an author and lecturer on Jewish concerns, met her in Minneapolis. He asked her if she wanted a job in New York City.         She became director of international relations and social relations for the National Council of Jewish Women, and, among other things, helped bring Jews out of Hitler's Germany. In 1938, she testified a Senate committee against the equal-rights amendment, saying that it might jeopardize the gains women had made in areas like widows' pensions.         In 1942, she received a call from Elizabeth Reynard, a Barnard professor who was to become assistant director of the Waves. Professor Reynard said that Miss McAfee, who was to become Waves director, wondered if she was interested in joining.         Like most of the original 40 officer candidates, all of whom had distinguished themselves professionally, Miss Rapaport had no idea why she was asked.         After training at Smith, Miss Rapaport was selected to teach the 750 women arriving for officers' training. She was then assigned to teach officers and enlisted Waves at U.S.S. Hunter, the name the Navy had given Hunter College in the Bronx. She succeeded in her quiet campaign to recruit black officers, and helped forestall a proposal for segregated platoons.         Her last assignment was in Hawaii, the first posting of Waves outside the continental United States. As a transportation officer there, she learned to drive.         After her discharge, she visited her sister in Los Angeles. On a street corner, she saw Mr. Borsten, whom she had dated before the war. They were married a few months later.         In addition to him, Mrs. Borsten is survived by a son, Joseph Borsten of Los Angeles; a daughter, Joan Borsten Vidov of Los Angeles; a sister, Lillian Minkowski of Santa Cruz; and a grandson.       
         Catharine Crozier, a versatile organist who played at the inaugural concerts of the instruments at both Avery Fisher Hall and Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center, died Sept. 19 in Portland, Ore. She was 89.         Ms. Crozier specialized in French music, ranging from Baroque composers like Nicolas de Grigny and Louis-Claude Daquin to 20th-century masters like Olivier Messiaen, Jehan Alain and Marcel Dupré.         But she was equally adept with the classic German repertory and modern works by Paul Hindemith, Vincent Persichetti and others.         Ms. Crozier was one of the most visible concert organists of the last half-century and was chosen as one of the players to christen the new organ at Philharmonic Hall -- now called Avery Fisher Hall -- in 1962, along with E. Power Biggs and Virgil Fox. (The organ was removed during a renovation in 1976.) She also performed at the dedication of the Alice Tully Hall organ in 1975.         In a review of the Alice Tully Hall concert, Allen Hughes of The New York Times called Ms. Crozier a ''symbol of uncompromising quality among organ virtuosos.''         Ms. Crozier, who was born in Hobart, Okla., attended the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, where she received a bachelor's degree in 1936 and both a master's degree and an Artist's Diploma in 1941.         She made her debut at the Washington National Cathedral in 1941 and was the chair of the organ department at Eastman from 1953 to 1955, when her husband, Harold Gleason, an organ professor at Eastman, retired.         In addition to performing, Ms. Crozier edited several editions of ''Method of Organ Playing,'' a textbook by her husband. The book's most recent edition was the eighth, in 1995. Mr. Gleason died in 1980.         In 1993 Ms. Crozier moved to Portland, where she was artist in residence at Trinity Episcopal Cathedral until early this year.         There are no immediate survivors.       
         Norma Storch, a white woman whose decision to have her 4-year-old mixed-race daughter raised by a black couple became the subject of an Emmy Award-winning documentary made by the daughter in adulthood, died on Aug. 28 at her home in Manhattan. She was 81.         The cause was cancer, said the daughter, June Cross, the producer of the documentary, ''Secret Daughter,'' which PBS broadcast in 1996.         The film was heralded as a searing look at race relations in the 1950's and 60's, and drew praise for its emotional rawness and the bravery of both mother and daughter. Other reviews suggested that the documentary's power came from a mother's willingness to reject her daughter and then rationalize it.         Ms. Cross said in an interview last week that this impression properly reflected the documentary but not their real relationship. She said that tensions were exaggerated for dramatic effect.         But for almost 35 years, Mrs. Storch and her husband -- the actor and comedian Larry Storch, who starred as Cpl. Randolph Agarn in the 1960's comedy series ''F Troop,''-- indisputably lived a lie. They told friends and acquaintances that the black girl who visited them at their Hollywood home was their adopted daughter, who lived with a black family for most of the year.         The truth was that Ms. Cross was the child of an affair Mrs. Storch had had with Jimmy Cross, a black song-and-dance man who was Stump in the well-known performing team Stump and Stumpy.         Mrs. Storch fled Mr. Cross soon after their daughter's birth in 1954, because of his drinking, drug use and violence toward her, she said. As June matured and her complexion darkened, she and her mother encountered racist reactions, including a petition from residents of their Manhattan building demanding that they leave.         Mrs. Storch asked two friends, a middle-class black couple in Atlantic City, to raise June. After they took her in, Mrs. Storch cried every night, developed shingles and wrote daily letters to the girl, according to the documentary.         Norma Greve was born on April 6, 1922, in Pocatello, Idaho. Her mother moved from place to place, married seven times or so, and from time to time vanished completely. From the time Mrs. Storch was 9 until her marriage, she used the last name Booth, the name of one of her stepfathers.         Shortly after graduation from high school in Long Beach, Calif., Norma Greve married Jack May, a competitive surfer, with whom she had a son, Lary. After their divorce in 1945, she moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting career, and became a member of the Circle Repertory Theater.         In 1947, she had a brief romance with Larry Storch, and gave birth in 1948 to a daughter, Candace, whom they put up for adoption. Ms. Cross said that Candace and the Storches were reunited after Candace read an article about the documentary in People magazine.         Mrs. Storch had placed Lary with various caretakers as she pursued her acting career. He is now a professor at the University of Minnesota and helped persuade his mother to participate in the documentary.         In addition to June Cross and Lary May, Mrs. Storch is survived by her husband, who lives in Manhattan; her daughter Candace Herman of Los Angeles; and six grandchildren.         Mrs. Storch was working as a hatcheck girl in Manhattan in 1959 when she renewed her relationship with Mr. Storch. They were married in 1961, and two years later moved to Hollywood, where she managed his career.         June Cross spent many summers with them. For the couple's conservative friends, they concocted an elaborate story about having adopted June, who they said was the abused child of former neighbors. They said they had sent the girl to live with black friends of theirs, which was true.         ''In those days, people were encrusted in prejudice,'' Mr. Storch said in an interview with People magazine in 1996. ''We saw no reason to rock the boat.''         Neither did Ms. Cross, even after graduating from Harvard and making a successful career as a television producer, with PBS's MacNeil-Lehrer Report, then at CBS News and later with ''Frontline'' on PBS.         She had one reunion with her father, months before he died of cancer in 1981. She told People magazine that she felt only ''detached curiosity.''         But Ms. Cross said she came to appreciate the decision her mother had made when she was a little girl. In one scene in the documentary, she laughs nervously when her mother says she would have aborted her if she had had enough money.         At another point in the film, she says, ''I think the truth of it is that she loved me enough to give me away.''       
         Dr. Margaret A. Johns, who showed that pheromones can set off hormonal changes in mammals when they activate receptors in a tiny nasal cavity, a process that can attract animals of the opposite sex, died Saturday at St. Vincent's Manhattan Hospital. She was 75.         The cause was a heart attack, said her daughter Sara Johns Griffen.         Scientists had known of the nasal structure, called the vomeronasal organ, on each side of the nasal septum, for more than a century. But it was widely believed that the organ had gradually become functionless and that the odorless chemical messages known as pheromones were detected instead by the olfactory system.         Dr. Johns's research, published in the journal Nature in 1978, led other scientists to question, and later debunk, the long-held notion that humans were incapable of sensing pheromones.         In recent years, research has suggested that the vomeronasal organ acts on the human brain in its hypothalamus, which produces hormones and regulates appetite, anxiety, fear and other behaviors.         In her experiment, Dr. Johns, a graduate student at the time, found that female rats would start to ovulate if exposed to an outside stimulus, like male urine. She then blocked off the vomeronasal organ in several female rats and repeated the procedure. This time, the urine had no effect, suggesting that the pheromones were acting not on the sense of smell, but on the organ many assumed had no real purpose.         ''There was evidence of pheromone communication in insects and invertebrates, but she was the first one to find it in mammals,'' said Dr. Louis Monti-Bloch, who worked on studies in the early 1990's proving that pheromones can induce behavioral changes in humans. ''That inspired studies that explored whether these same pheromones were having an effect in humans.''         Today, scientists are developing synthetic pheromones that could have a range of medical uses, like relieving anxiety and easing symptoms of premenstrual syndrome.         Born in Boston, Margaret Anne Johns earned her bachelor's degree from Hunter College, but not until she was in her late 30's, after she had raised two children. She went on to receive her Ph.D. from the Institute of Animal Behavior at Rutgers University.         In the early 1980's, she did research at Mount Sinai in New York showing that cells within the pituitary gland could absorb serotonin. Her paper, published in the journal Endocrinology in 1982, suggested that the hormone might have an effect on the anterior pituitary gland in mammals, which helps to regulate growth and ovulation, among other things.         Whether serotonin influences the anterior pituitary is an issue that many scientists debate to this day, said Dr. Marc Freeman, a professor of biological science and neuroscience at Florida State University.         Dr. Johns's first marriage, to Craig Johns, ended in divorce in the early 80's.         In addition to her daughter Sara, who lives in Kinderhook, N.Y., she is survived by her husband, H. Peter Stern; another daughter, Kate Johns, of Old Chatham, N.Y.; a brother, Stephen Bush of San Pedro, Calif.; three stepchildren; and eight grandchildren.       
         Carolyn G. Heilbrun, a retired Columbia University literary scholar whose extensive writings included pioneering books and essays in the feminist canon and a dozen highly erudite detective novels under the pseudonym Amanda Cross, died at her home in Manhattan on Thursday. She was 77.         Professor Heilbrun, who had written of taking her own life in a 1997 book, ''The Last Gift of Time: Life Beyond Sixty,'' committed suicide, said her son, Robert. She had not been ill, he noted yesterday. ''She wanted to control her destiny,'' he said, ''and she felt her life was a journey that had concluded.''         Aside from serving as an instructor at Brooklyn College in 1959-60 and as a visiting lecturer or professor at Yale, Princeton, Swarthmore and other colleges, Ms. Heilbrun spent her entire academic career at Columbia, joining the faculty in 1960 as an instructor of English and comparative literature and retiring in 1992 as the Avalon Foundation Professor in the Humanities.         But she was best known as the author of nine scholarly books, including ''Toward a Recognition of Androgyny,'' ''Reinventing Womanhood'' and ''Writing a Woman's Life,'' and scores of articles that interpreted women's literature from a feminist perspective, and as the author of the Kate Fansler mysteries. Her heroine, like her creator, was a professor of literature and a feminist.         The novels were ostensibly murder mysteries whose amateur sleuth sometimes sought clues in literary texts and a killer's motives in academic politics. Most were well received by readers, but some critics said the plots were thin and the social commentary thick, and that the real subjects were women's changing social positions, relationships with one another and struggle for independence.         The books offered scathing depictions of academic backbiting, observations on Ivy League social pretensions and thinly veiled, unflattering portraits of Columbia colleagues, including one professor who seemed to have been modeled after the writer Lionel Trilling.         Some critics complained that satiric wit and clever talk filled half a book before the victim fell dead, and that some of it sounded like an imitation of Oscar Wilde or George Bernard Shaw. But devotees said it was all good fun, and some compared her work to the cerebral puzzles of Dorothy L. Sayers.         Fearing that her mystery writing might be seen by colleagues as frivolous and might even jeopardize her chances for tenure, Ms. Heilbrun concealed the identity of Amanda Cross for six years. In 1964 her first novel, ''In the Last Analysis,'' was nominated for an Edgar Award by the Mystery Writers of America. ''Winning would have blown my cover,'' she recalled.         But after the 1970 publication of ''Poetic Justice,'' with its recognizable depiction of Columbia University's atmosphere after the student revolt of the late 1960's, Ms. Heilbrun's friends began to guess that she might be Amanda Cross, the author of three novels, including ''The James Joyce Murder.'' Later novels included ''Death in a Tenured Position,'' ''No Word from Winifred'' and ''The Puzzled Heart.''         Carolyn Gold Heilbrun was born on Jan. 13, 1926, in East Orange, N.J., the only child of Archibald Gold, an accountant, and Estelle Roemer Gold, who, her daughter would recall, ''sat at home and was bored out of her mind.'' The family moved to Manhattan when Ms. Heilbrun was 6, and she became a voracious reader, devouring Nancy Drew and Judy Bolton mysteries and, as a teenager, the novels of Virginia Woolf and Willa Cather.         She graduated from private schools in New York and from Wellesley College in 1947 with a bachelor's degree in English. She was married in 1945 to James Heilbrun, a Harvard student who became a professor of economics at Fordham University. In addition to her son, of Brooklyn, and her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Margaret Heilbrun, of Brooklyn, and Emily Heilbrun, of Eugene, Ore., and two grandchildren.         Enrolling in graduate school at Columbia, Ms. Heilbrun received a master's degree in 1951 and a doctorate in 1959. Her first notable essay was ''The Character of Hamlet's Mother,'' a 1957 article in Shakespeare Quarterly. It portrayed Gertrude as clever, not shallow, lucid rather than silly: ideas that were forerunners of feminism at the time, but hardly startling when the essay was reprinted in 1990 as part of ''Hamlet's Mother and Other Women.''         On the Columbia faculty, Ms. Heilbrun rose through the ranks: assistant professor in 1962, associate professor in 1967, full professor with tenure in 1972, Avalon Professor in 1985. In 1986 she became the first director of the university's Institute for Research on Women and Gender, which promotes feminist scholarship.         Her academic specialty was British modern literature, roughly from 1890 to 1950, an era that included Yeats, Conrad and Eliot, with a particular focus on the Bloomsbury group, made up of Virginia Woolf, Lytton Strachey, E. M. Forster and other writers.         Although she was widely respected by feminist scholars, she complained when she retired that she was isolated by her male colleagues at Columbia. ''When I spoke up for women's issues, I was made to feel unwelcome in my own department, kept off crucial committees, ridiculed, ignored,'' she told Anne Matthews in an interview for a New York Times Magazine article in 1992.         Throughout her academic career, and afterward, Ms. Heilbrun continued to write books and contribute articles to professional journals, newspapers and magazines. She wrote numerous book reviews and essays for Hers, a former column in The Times.         Her 1973 book, ''Toward a Recognition of Androgyny: Aspects of Male and Female in Literature,'' brought her to prominence in the academic feminist movement. Rejecting traditional ideas of male and female and using examples from Greek literature, the Bible and other writings, she urged women to escape from what she called the prison of gender.         Ms. Heilbrun drew on her long interest in biography and autobiography for her 1988 book, ''Writing a Woman's Life,'' her first best seller, which focused on women writing about themselves and other women. Even accomplished women, like Virginia Woolf and Eudora Welty, tended to judge themselves on how well they fulfilled traditional expectations, she concluded.       
         Dr. Beatrice Blyth Whiting, an anthropologist at Harvard and an expert on the influence of culture on personality, died on Sept. 29 in Cambridge, Mass. She was 89.         Dr. Whiting and her husband, Dr. John W. M. Whiting, a fellow Harvard anthropologist, traveled extensively to study parental practices and child behavior, hoping to identify aspects of human development found in all cultures.         In 1954, she and her husband began the Six Cultures Study of Socialization, a project that involved field studies in Mexico, India, Kenya, Okinawa, the Philippines and the United States. Their work with the project resulted in many scholarly articles.         Twelve years later, they founded the Child Development Research Unit at the University of Nairobi to conduct more intensive studies in Kenya.         In the 1980's, after their retirement from Harvard, the Whitings turned their attention to older children, directing the Comparative Adolescence Project.         Dr. Whiting developed a particular interest in the development of gender roles, a subject she covered in her 1988 book, ''Children of Different Worlds: The Formation of Social Behavior,'' written with Dr. Carolyn P. Edwards. Her book on the lives of Kenyan women, ''Ngecha: A Kenyan Community in a Time of Rapid Social Change,'' also written with Dr. Edwards, is to be published later this year.         Dr. Whiting, who joined Harvard's faculty in 1952, became one of the first women at the university to receive tenure when she was named professor of education at the graduate school of education in 1974. She was a graduate of Bryn Mawr and received a doctorate in anthropology from Yale in 1943.         She lived in Cambridge and in Chilmark on Martha's Vineyard.         Beatrice Blyth Whiting was born on Staten Island on April 14, 1914. She is survived by her daughter, Susan Whiting of Chilmark and Stuart, Fla. Her husband died in 1999.       
         Dorothy J. Farnan, a high school English teacher whose friendship with the poet W. H. Auden and his companion, Chester Kallman, enabled her to write ''Auden in Love,'' a book about their life together, died on Oct. 23 in her Manhattan apartment. She was 84.         Ms. Farnan bridged the worlds of the flamboyantly bohemian Greenwich Village of the 1940's and the conventional milieu of her job as an English teacher at Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn. At times her friend Auden, considered by many the best poet writing in English in the 20th century, even invited her students to tea.         Through Mr. Kallman, who was about her age, Ms. Farnan met his father, Eddie, whom she eventually married.         Edward Mendelson, a Columbia University professor and Auden's literary executor, said in an interview on Thursday that ''Auden in Love'' (Simon & Schuster, 1984) was important because it made it possible to understand the Auden-Kallman relationship, which endured for 34 years, ''in ways that would have been impossible without it.''         The book progresses from the time when the poet, then 32, met Mr. Kallman, a brilliant college student of 18, and traces the peaks and valleys of their relationship, including an exchange of wedding rings and Auden's murderous rage when he was first betrayed by his mercurial lover. It ends not with Mr. Kallman, a poet and librettist, discovering Auden's corpse in a Vienna hotel in 1973, but with Mr. Kallman's own lonely end just 15 months later.         Ms. Farnan had a special vantage point, and many but not all reviewers said she gave an unexpectedly detailed, intimate and accurate view of Auden's private life. ''What she remembered corresponded to things she could not have looked up,'' Professor Mendelson said.         The book oozes gossip, and some reviewers criticized this quality, including Julian Symons, writing in The Times Literary Supplement in London in 1985. Nevertheless, Mr. Symons said the book was an important addition to what he termed ''the Auden biographical corpus.''         Ms. Farnan argued that past Auden biographies had understated the importance of the Kallman relationship, and in so doing had ''discounted most of all Auden's need to love.'' She included a previously unknown Auden poem in the form of a letter written on Christmas Day 1941, in which the events of the Nativity are given outrageous counterparts in the relationship between Auden and Mr. Kallman.         It reads, in part:         Because mothers have much to do with your queerness and mine, because we have both lost ours, and because Mary is a camp name;         As this morning I think of Mary I think of you.         Dorothy Jeanne-Therese Farnan was born on June 29, 1919, in Winona, Minn., the only child of James Farnan, a lawyer, and the former Nanneta Von Starck. She earned bachelor's and master's degrees in English from the University of Michigan, where in 1941 she met Mr. Kallman, a graduate student, ''young, blond and deliciously arrogant,'' in her words.         Mr. Kallman had met Auden in 1939 at a poetry reading in New York. The book's most memorable theme is Auden's determination to remain faithful to Mr. Kallman, even support him financially, as the younger man broke his heart again and again.         ''Chester fell in love for the first time again'' is a phrase that repeats through Ms. Farnan's narrative.         Mr. Kallman and Auden were living together in Michigan when Ms. Farnan met Mr. Kallman, and through him, Auden. Then she moved to Manhattan and lost track of both of them, until Mr. Kallman tapped her shoulder one day at the Waldorf Cafeteria. Soon, she and her best friend, Mary Valentine, were living a life of laughter and ideas, centered in Greenwich Village, revolving around Mr. Kallman, and liberally lubricated with wine of often dubious quality.         ''Those years with Auden, there was a sense of them being golden years,'' the Rev. Carla Valentine Pryne, Mary Valentine's daughter, Ms. Farnan's goddaughter and an Episcopal minister, said in an interview on Thursday.         Ms. Farnan fell in love with Mr. Kallman's father, Eddie, and married him -- ''somewhat illegally,'' she wrote in her book -- in 1948. After the death of Eddie's actual wife, they were legally married in 1975. He died in 1986.         Meanwhile, Ms. Farnan -- a very tall woman with naturally platinum hair, a penchant for rescuing stray cats and a passion for the Latin Mass -- was gradually rising in the New York City public school system. In 1986, she became the first woman to be head of the English department at Erasmus.         Veronica Warren, her successor in that job and now an assistant principal in New Jersey, recalled on Thursday how tough Ms. Farnan's standards were: even remedial-reading students had to study eight Shakespeare plays in their four years of high school.         ''She refused to believe that every student couldn't learn the classics,'' Ms. Warren said in an interview. ''She even considered American literature inferior.''         In her book, Ms. Farnan mentioned that she was only heeding Auden's advice: ''They don't need a paid teacher to learn to read Hemingway,'' he had told her.         Correction:  November 17, 2003, Monday  An obituary on Nov. 2 about Dorothy Farnan, a New York City teacher who wrote ''Auden in Love,'' a book about W. H. Auden and his companion, Chester Kallman, misstated the year in which she became chairman of the English department at Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn. It was 1966, not 1986.       
         Sheila Smythe, a former head of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield and dean of the school of public health at New York Medical College in Valhalla, N.Y., died on Tuesday at New York Weill Cornell Center. She was 71 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a heart attack. a spokeswoman at the college said.         Ms. Smythe was appointed dean in 1990, when she also became professor of health policy and economics at the school. She became its executive vice president in 1995.         From 1987 to 1990, she was chief health policy adviser in the United States General Accounting Office. From 1983 to 1985, she was president and chief operating officer of Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, where she worked for 20 years.         Sheila Mary Smythe was born on Nov. 1, 1932, in County Sligo, Ireland. She earned bachelor's degrees at schools in Omaha and New York, and a master's degree in biostatistics from Columbia University.         Throughout her career Ms. Smythe advocated for the improvement of health care through education and public health programs. She served as an adviser on several task forces for health care reform.         Ms. Smythe also served on boards and advisory councils at numerous charities and educational organizations, including the March of Dimes, the Visiting Nurse Services in Westchester, Manhattanville College, the Dominican Academy and Catholic Charities USA.         She is survived by a niece, Sheila P. Gonley of Bournemouth, England.       
         Dr. Gisela Konopka, a pioneer in the study of troubled adolescents who provided groundbreaking insights on disruptive behavior among girls, died on Dec. 9 in Minneapolis. She was 93.         The cause was pulmonary edema, said Dr. Robert Blum, a friend and colleague, who is a professor of pediatrics at the University of Minnesota. The Konopka Institute for Best Practices in Adolescent Health, named for Dr. Konopka, is at the university.         A retired professor of social work, Dr. Konopka was the author of several works, including ''The Adolescent Girl in Conflict.'' The book, published in 1966, was one of the first in-depth examinations of the lives of troubled teenage girls.         ''All my life, it seems, I have talked about how people can't be bad just because they're black, or Jewish or women,'' Dr. Konopka told The Minneapolis Star Tribune in an interview for an article published in 2000. ''Well, they can't be bad just because they're young.''         Judith Kahn, director of the Konopka Institute, said ''The Adolescent Girl in Conflict'' broke new ground in offering girls a chance to present their own perspectives.         ''No one before had really listened to troubled adolescents and to what they said they wanted and needed in their lives,'' Ms. Kahn said. ''It wasn't just a look at the data, it was a look at what was underneath the data.''         Born Gisela Peiper in Berlin, she joined the resistance movement after Hitler came to power and eventually fled Germany, arriving in the United States in 1941. She met her future husband, Paul, in Germany before her departure, and they married after he arrived in New York a short time later.         Dr. Konopka received a master's degree in social service administration from the University of Pittsburgh and joined the social work faculty at the University of Minnesota in 1947. She later received a doctorate in social welfare from Columbia.         She remained a professor at the University of Minnesota until her retirement in 1978. Her husband, Paul, an engineer at General Mills, died in 1976.         She is survived by a foster daughter, Patricia Dreyer, of Minnetonka, Minn.       
         Blanche Davis Blank, a social scientist and author who led Hunter College as interim president in the early 1990's, died on Friday at her home in New Rochelle, N.Y., her family said. She was 80.         Dr. Blank, a former social science dean at Hunter and academic dean at Yeshiva University, was acting president of Hunter College from 1993 until her retirement as professor emeritus two years later.         She was a founder and, from 1972 to 1980, chairwoman of the Hunter Institute for Trial Judges. She started it with Justice Hortense W. Gabel, a Hunter graduate like her, to provide a common forum for New York's judicial, legal, civic and academic communities.         She wrote several books, most recently a report for the Fund for Peace in Washington, ''It Takes Two to Tango: International Perspectives on the United Nations'' (1998).         One of her books still in print is ''The Not So Grand Jury: The Story of the Federal Grand Jury System'' (University Press of America, 1993). Stemming from her own two-year stint on a federal grand jury, it examines the system in theory and practice, its costs, problems and, in the author's view, excessive secrecy.         She was born in Brooklyn and graduated magna cum laude from Hunter in 1944. She received an M.A. in public administration from Syracuse in 1945 and a Ph.D. in American political institutions from Columbia in 1951.         She started as a lecturer at City College and the New School and returned to Hunter as an instructor in political science in 1956. Named a full professor in 1968, she was dean of the division of social sciences from 1972 until she joined the staff at Yeshiva University in 1977.         She was the academic dean at Yeshiva until 1981 and a political science professor until 1993. That year, the trustees of the City University recalled her as Hunter's acting president, to replace Paul LeClerc, who became president of the New York Public Library. She remained at Hunter, also teaching a course, until the long-delayed arrival of David A. Caputo as the college's 12th president in 1995.         Dr. Blank is survived by her husband of 58 years, Joseph S.; three daughters, Laura, Barbara and Alice, all of Manhattan; and three grandchildren.       
         Dr. Margaret Singer, a leading expert on brainwashing who testified in several high-profile cases contending that various groups inappropriately manipulated their members to control their behavior, died on Nov. 23 in Berkeley, Calif. She was 82.         The cause was respiratory failure, said her son, Sam.         In her long career, Dr. Singer investigated and testified about techniques used by North Koreans against American soldiers in wartime and the Symbionese Liberation Army's influence over the kidnapped heiress Patricia Hearst.         In the 1950's, Dr. Singer interviewed a number of American soldiers who had renounced the United States after returning from captivity in North Korea. The soldiers, she found, had been isolated and plied with propaganda, at times under the threat of physical harm.         Years later, she testified in defense of Ms. Hearst in a case that brought Dr. Singer national recognition and helped generate public curiosity about mind control.         Dr. Singer and her colleagues delved into a little known area of psychology at the trial, arguing that Ms. Hearst had helped rob a bank because she had been brainwashed to embrace the values of the Symbionese Liberation Army, which abducted her.         The group, the team argued, subjected Ms. Hearst to intensely stressful conditions, like isolating her from family and friends and locking her in a closet for six weeks, allowing its members to indoctrinate her and force a bizarre behavioral transformation.         Though Ms. Hearst was convicted, the trial bolstered Dr. Singer's reputation as an expert on mind control. In the following years, she repeatedly testified against the Unification Church, led by the Rev. Sun Myung Moon.         In one case, a libel suit against The Daily Mail of London, she argued that the church was a cult that brainwashed its members by showering them with intense affection, a process she called ''love-bombing.''         Dr. Singer said that she had interviewed hundreds of members of the church and testified that its techniques for mind control were more powerful than those used by the North Koreans on their war prisoners. The church lost its case.         ''This has put us back to the start of the road again,'' Michael Marshall, an official of the church, said at the time of the lawsuit. ''But we shall continue to fight for recognition and to show that we are a genuine religious movement.''         Dr. Singer went on to testify as an expert witness in dozens of cases against groups she described as destructive cults. Former members of the groups or the anguished families of members, like some of the people who lost relatives among the Branch Davidians in the Waco, Tex., in 1993, would often seek her advice.         Several members of the People's Temple, with Dr. Singer's help, left that group before 900 people committed mass suicide in Guyana in 1978.         Dr. Singer would often help win lawsuits against groups that former members claimed had lured them into dark, insular worlds that left them psychologically traumatized.         ''Her testimony would help people understand the clinical impact of a cult's manipulation and exploitation,'' said Dr. Richard Ofshe, a sociology professor at the University of California at Berkeley who worked with Dr. Singer for 20 years. ''There was a constant stream of people who would go into these organizations and end up in psychiatric emergency rooms.''         Dr. Singer's battles made her a target for harassment and death threats. At times, she found dead animals on her doorstep.         Margaret Thaler Singer was born in Denver and earned her bachelor's degree, master's degree and Ph.D. from the University of Denver. She became an adjunct professor at Berkeley in the 1950's.         Dr. Singer conducted several widely known studies on schizophrenia and was a renowned family therapist. She spent much of her career at Berkeley, but also taught at the University of Rochester and Albert Einstein College of Medicine, among others.         In addition to her son, Dr. Singer is survived by her husband, Dr. Jerome R. Singer; a daughter, Martha Singer, also of Berkeley; and five grandchildren.       
         Dr. Elizabeth Bates, a leading expert on the way infants develop language and an outspoken critic of the theory that humans are endowed at birth with a language module, died on Sunday at her home in San Diego. She was 56.         The cause was pancreatic cancer, said Dr. Jeffrey Elman, a close friend and a colleague at the University of California, San Diego.         Dr. Bates, a professor of cognitive science at U.C.S.D. and the director of its Center for Research in Language, was known for her very public stance in the debate on nature versus nurture, that is, how much of human behavior is genetic and how much is learned from the environment.         Dr. Bates thought all development, including the acquisition of language, rested on a foundation of general mental abilities. For example, humans drive cars not because their brains contain car-driving modules but by using various visual, motor and focusing skills, which are parts of the brain's wider repertoire.         Language is special and unique, Dr. Bates said, but its specialness is derived from the interaction of bits and pieces in the brain that are recruited for many purposes. Defining language as ''a new machine built out of old parts,'' Dr. Bates spent her career working out the details of that concept.         In putting forth her ideas, Dr. Bates criticized the theories of the linguist Noam Chomsky of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and his colleague Dr. Steven Pinker, the psychology professor, now at Harvard. They contend that infants have a high degree of early knowledge and that development is more a matter of unfolding inborn traits.         Frequent sparring between the two sides, one based in California, the other in Massachusetts, led to the aphorism that much of cognitive neuroscience lay within the dynamic pull of a west pole and an east pole. Dr. Bates was ''queen of the west pole,'' Dr. Elman said.         Dr. Pinker said in an interview: ''As much as we locked horns, I had a huge amount of respect for her intellect and for keeping people like me honest. In anticipating her criticisms, she forced me to do better work.''         Dr. Bates conducted studies on more than 20 languages on four continents, showing how so-called universals of language like noun-verb agreement vary significantly in specific languages.         She studied infants born with extensive damage to the brain's language areas and found that their language abilities developed normally. In recent work, she found that there was a significant overlap in areas of the brain involved in processing language and areas involved in processing environmental sounds like trains whistling, cows mooing and doors slamming. She concluded that all these areas were specialized for meaningful sounds, not just language.         Elizabeth Ann Bates was born Wichita, Kan. After graduating from St. Louis University, she earned a doctorate in human development from the University of Chicago.         In 1983, she joined the psychology department at U.C.S.D. and in 1989 became the director of the Project in Cognitive and Neural Development at the Center for Research in Language. She wrote or was a co-author of 10 books, including the influential 1996 volume ''Rethinking Innateness,'' and more than 200 articles.         Dr. Bates is survived by her husband, George Carnevale, a fluid physicist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, and a daughter, Julia Carnevale.
