         Louisa Matthiasdottir, an exemplar of the strain of painterly representation that runs through the history of postwar American art, died Saturday at O'Connor Hospital in Delhi, N.Y. She was 83 and lived in New York from 1942 until late 1999, when she moved to Delhi to live with her daughter, Temma Bell, who is also painter.         Ms. Matthiasdottir, whose nickname was Ulla, was born in Reykjavik, Iceland, in 1917. She came to New York in 1942 and had her first solo show at the Jane Street Gallery, New York's first artists' cooperative, in 1948. A laconic, independent woman, she gave few interviews and did not teach painting or write about her work. ''As to painting, I just start painting and that's about it,'' she once said.         Those few words summed up a style that was similarly cryptic and to the point, and that reduced the world to a series of simple, blocky shapes and angled planes of clear, ringing color, all dispatched with a crisp, unfettered directness that allowed no reworking.         It was a style that was at once cool and celebratory, and Ms. Matthiasdottir deployed it evenhandedly. Her work included portraits and self-portraits, still lifes, interiors and distilled, light-filled paintings of the coastal landscape of Iceland, which she depicted as sparsely populated by houses, horses or sheep. She maintained close ties to Iceland, where she came to be viewed as something of a national treasure. She visited almost annually and retained her Icelandic citizenship.         Although Ms. Matthiasdottir enjoyed both critical and financial success in New York, especially after 1970, official recognition proved elusive. She was, for example, included in only one Whitney Biennial, in 1973, and is not represented in any of the city's four major museums. She was one of several postwar artists who, despite Abstract Expressionism's unanimous success, persisted in the notion that abstraction and representation were not mutually exclusive states, that one could paint from reality in a way that gave form, color and paint a power all their own.         The artists who acted on this belief in the late 1940's and early 50's included Robert de Niro Sr. and his wife, Catherine Admiral, Nicholas Carone, Fairfield Porter, Alex Katz and later Nell Blaine, as well as San Franciscans like David Park. Yet Ms. Matthiasdottir's style took root in Iceland before the war.         She was born into a well-to-do family in Reykjavik, where her father was a prominent surgeon. Her parents encouraged her painting, she once said, because they never saw her do anything else. In 1934 she was sent to Copenhagen, where she enrolled in a three-year course at the School of Commercial Art, which encouraged her penchant for simplification and bright color. In 1938 her parents took her to Paris, where she studied with Marcel Gromaire and encountered the work of Matisse. She then returned to Reykjavik and worked for two years among the city's small, struggling avant-garde.         Ms. Matthiasdottir developed a style that merged the post-Impressionism of Edvard Munch with the palette of Fauvism, as well as the influences of less well-known Scandinavian modernists. When she came to New York she intended to study at the Art Students League, but ended up attending classes taught by Hans Hofmann, whose emphasis on structure and strong color she found compatible. Within a year of her arrival she met Leland Bell, a tall, handsome painter who was as voluble as she was aloof. Their marriage in 1944 marked the beginning of a partnership that included side-by-side studios in their house on 16th Street, occasional double exhibitions and a shared gallery, the Robert Schoelkopf Gallery on Madison Avenue, where Ms. Matthiasdottir had 17 solo shows between 1964 and 1991.         Her work is in the collections of the Art Institute of Chicago, the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden in Washington, the Indiana Art Museum in Bloomington and the National Gallery of Iceland in Reykjavik.         Mr. Bell died in 1991. In addition to her daughter, Ms. Matthiasdottir is survived by four granddaughters.         Correction:  March 4, 2000, Saturday  An obituary of the artist Louisa Matthiasdottir on Thursday misstated the given name of a postwar artist with whom she shared the belief that abstraction and representationalism were not mutually exclusive approaches to painting. The artist was Virginia Admiral, not Catherine.       
         Anna Sokolow, a modern-dance choreographer known for her social commitment and searing depictions of urban loneliness, died yesterday at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.         As a dancer and choreographer, beginning in the 1930's, Miss Sokolow was concerned with the toll that society exacts on the individual; her signature pieces were powerful studies in alienation. But she could also create lyrical dance poems that were terse and penetrating. Pain was rarely absent from her work, but her style was abstract, not literal, focused on the essence of deep feeling.         She was equally at home with actors and dancers and often choreographed for the theater, including the Leonard Bernstein musical ''Candide.'' For many years, she taught courses in movement to actors at the HB Studio, directed by Herbert Berghof and the actress Uta Hagen. Miss Sokolow used movement ''as a human experience, not formally, not mechanistically,'' Miss Hagen said at a program at the Kaye Playhouse in honor of Miss Sokolow's 85th birthday.         Jerome Robbins, whose ballets in the 1950's often also dealt with alienation, said at the same tribute, ''She has influenced us all.''         Miss Sokolow consistently portrayed losers, underdogs, the disaffected and questioners of life's meaning. Her movement style was known for its passages of hopeless running in place, silent screams, accusatory stares and sudden falls. Sympathetic to youthful rebellion, she became famous for her images of young people glaring confrontationally at the audience.         If her themes seemed deliberately restricted, the impact of her work was genuine. It surprised no one in the dance community that in 1966 she  was one of seven choreographers who were awarded the initial dance grants made by the recently established National Council on the Arts.         Among her most famous pieces was ''Rooms'' (1955), in which chairs symbolize rooms in a cheap hotel, and the way dancers move on and around those chairs reveals the anxieties and obsessions of the hotel's residents. The work was used in a short film, also titled ''Rooms''  (1966), which featured, among others, Martha Clarke, a Sokolow student at the Juilliard School whose later choreography owed a debt to her mentor. Other Sokolow choreography was preserved by the director Shirley Clarke (Martha Clarke's aunt) in two 1957 films, ''Bullfight'' and ''A Moment in Love.''         Miss Sokolow often choreographed to jazz, and she cast a keen eye on popular culture. Her ''Opus 65'' (1965) was called a ''beat ballet'' for the way she made young dancers in jeans act out scenes of youthful defiance. The work, danced to a jazz score by Teo Macero, a frequent Sokolow collaborator, was performed by the Joffrey Ballet and ended with the sullen young cast jumping into the orchestra pit.         In 1967 Miss Sokolow was the first choreographer hired for the rock musical ''Hair,'' but she withdrew from the show before it opened. Two decades earlier, in 1947, she had choreographed ''Street Scene,'' Kurt Weill's somber musical set on the sidewalks of New York.         Her penchant for pessimistic themes sometimes raised eyebrows. The dance critic Walter Terry said in The Saturday Review in 1967 that ''you can be assured, after seeing any of her dance works, that you'll want to go home and kill yourself.'' Yet Anna Kisselgoff said in The New York Times in 1976 that ''the secret of her success is the way she distills emotion into a few movements.''         Analyzing her outlook, Miss Sokolow once said: ''I don't have a dim view of humanity. I'm not neurotic. But I don't have that happy philosophy, because what the hell is there to be happy about?''         Anna Sokolow's early life was one of hardship. Her parents immigrated  from Russia, and she was born in Hartford in 1910; three years later the family moved to New York, where they struggled to survive. Her father developed Parkinson's disease, which steadily incapacitated him until he had to be hospitalized;  her mother worked as a sewing machine operator and was active in the Socialist Party.         The family lived in poverty on the Lower East Side. But like many immigrants, the Sokolows prized culture and sent Anna as a child to study dancing at a settlement house. She continued her training at the Neighborhood Playhouse, where one of her teachers was Martha Graham. She joined the Graham company in 1930 and remained with it for eight years.         Even while dancing with Graham, she had a little troupe of her own, the Dance Unit, and gained a reputation as a choreographer with a social conscience. She often collaborated with the composer Alex North, who later worked in Hollywood. The Dance Unit toured the Soviet Union in 1934. But despite her concern for suffering humanity, Miss Sokolow's productions mystified the ballet-loving Russians.         She played a major role in developing modern dance in another country after 1939, when the Mexican painter Carlos Merida arranged for her to perform in Mexico City. Although a misinformed press agent billed her as a Russian ballerina, her success led her to stay on and found a modern-dance company, La Paloma Azul, in 1940. Financial problems forced it to disband, but its productions influenced many young Mexican choreographers.         Miss Sokolow returned to Mexico City in 1953 to choreograph for a modern-dance festival. Her premiere was ''Lyric Suite,'' a melancholy mood piece to music by Alban Berg that has since been danced by Miss Sokolow's New York troupe, the Players' Project, and several ballet companies.         Miss Sokolow also helped influence Israeli dance. She first went to Israel in 1954 as an artistic adviser to Inbal, a company that preserved Yemenite Jewish traditions and tried to present those source materials in a contemporary manner. Partly as a result of her guidance, Inbal was much acclaimed at its American debut in 1958. Miss Sokolow often returned to Israel as teacher and choreographer.         In New York she taught at both dance and theater schools, among them the Juilliard School, the HB Studio, the American Theater Wing and the Actors Studio.         Her works entered the repertories of such varied companies as the Joffrey Ballet, the Netherlands Dance Theater, Ballet Rambert, the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the Oakland Ballet, the Royal Winnipeg Ballet and the Repertory Dance Theater of Utah.         Not all her dances were somber. ''Magritte, Magritte'' was based upon the Surrealist fantasies of the painter, ''Odes'' was filled with swirling movement patterns and ''Poem'' was lyrical. Nevertheless, ''Poem'' aroused controversy when it was presented in Mexico City in 1956 because an all-male episode  that could be interpreted as a depiction of homosexual love was denounced as pornographic by some theatergoers.         A tiny woman who dressed austerely, usually in black, Miss Sokolow looked increasingly frail over the years. Yet she continued working, and in 1995 her ''September Sonnet'' was much praised when it received its premiere at the Players' Project. This duet for Jim May and Lorry May, who had often worked with her in the past, was a heartfelt yet never sentimental portrait of middle-aged lovers. Miss Sokolow's honors include the Dance Magazine Award and the Samuel H. Scripps American Dance Festival Award.         Many of those who worked with her remembered her as a fierce disciplinarian. She once explained her pedagogical harshness by telling students: ''I don't dislike you; that's not why I'm hard on you. But I love dance more than I love you.''         Correction:  April 3, 2000, Monday  An obituary of the choreographer Anna Sokolow on Thursday referred incorrectly to her departure from the 1967 rock musical ''Hair.'' She was dismissed before it opened; she did not withdraw.       
         Essie Green Edmiston, an art dealer who represented many 20th-century African-American artists through her Harlem gallery, died on Feb. 26. She was 61 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was bladder cancer,  said Sylvia Hueston, a friend.         Mrs. Edmiston began showing art in her Brooklyn apartment in the 1970's while running a full-time psychiatric social work practice. After meeting the painter Romare Bearden, she turned her attention toward art as a career. With a credit union loan she established the Park Plaza Gallery in Park Slope in 1979. This was followed by the Essie Green Galleries in Harlem in 1989.         There she showed work by Bearden, Lois Mailou Jones and Jacob Lawrence, all of whom she knew as friends. She also showed the work of Allen Stringfellow, Norman Lewis, William S. Carter, William Ossawa Tanner, Charles Ethan Porter, Edwin Bannister and Charles Alston. At the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture she organized a Bearden show in 1991 and a Stringfellow show in 1998.         Mrs. Edmiston was born in Miami in 1938 and grew up in Springfield,  Mass. She received a master's degree in social work from New York University and was preparing a dissertation in social policy at Columbia University at the time of her death. She continued to practice as a psychiatric social worker until the mid-1980's.         She was a founding stockholder of  the Innercity Broadcasting Corporation, which is the owner of the radio stations WBLS-FM and WLIB-AM in New York City. She was also on its board. She was also a board member of the Nanette Bearden Contemporary Dance Theater. Since 1973 she  had been a member of the Soka Gakkai, a Buddhist organization.         She is survived by her husband, Sherman K. Edmiston Jr.; two stepchildren, Sherman K. III and Lisa A.  of New York City; three grandchildren; her mother, Mary L. Green,  and two brothers, Reuben Jr. and Eli Green, all of Springfield, Mass.; and five sisters, Betty Davis of Oakdale, Conn., Katherine Mutcherson of Silver Springs, Md., Iraline G. Barnes of Washington, Phyllis Green of Atlanta, and Lorraine Green of Chicago.       
         Emily Maxwell, the wife of the author and New Yorker editor William Maxwell, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78.         The cause was ovarian cancer, her daughter Kate Maxwell said.         Mrs. Maxwell published short articles and reminiscences in The New Yorker, and from 1957 to 1965, she wrote year-end reviews of children's books for the magazine's Christmas list. She was also a painter.         Mr. Maxwell dedicated a number of his books to his wife. One of them, ''The Old Man at the Railroad Crossing and Other Tales'' (1957), is a collection of fables he wrote for her, some as bedtime stories when she couldn't sleep, and others as Christmas gifts for the family.         In addition to her daughter Kate, of Manhattan, she is survived by her husband; another daughter, Brookie Maxwell, also of Manhattan; a grandson; and two brothers, Robert Noyes of Portland, Ore., and H. F. Noyes of Athens, Greece.       
         Virginia Admiral, an American painter and writer who studied with Hans Hofmann, died on July 27. She was 85 and lived in New York City.         Ms. Admiral was born in Oregon and studied at the Art Institute of Chicago. While working on the Federal Arts Project in Oakland, Calif., in 1938, she became closely involved with the San Francisco poetry scene. With the poet Robert Duncan she published a single issue of a small-press magazine, Epitaph, which developed into The Experimental Review. Later, in New York, she wrote for True Crimes magazine.         In 1940 she enrolled at the Hofmann School in New York to study painting, where she met the artist Robert De Niro, who was working as a class monitor. They married in 1942; their son, the actor Robert De Niro, was born in 1943 and lives in New York City. Ms. Admiral's husband died in 1993. She is survived by a sister, Eleanor Haefele of Sacramento, and five grandchildren.         In 1942 Ms. Admiral exhibited in the Springs Salon for Young Artists at Peggy Guggenheim's Art of This Century Gallery in Manhattan. She had a solo show there in 1946 and was included in the Peggy Guggenheim Collection at the Venice Biennale in 1947.         In the 1960's Ms. Admiral was active in the antiwar movement, often contributing work to shows based on political themes. She was also instrumental in establishing low-cost housing for artists in SoHo. From 1973 to 1980 she showed at Buecker and Harpsichords gallery.         Her work is in the permanent collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Museum of Modern Art in  New York and the Peggy Guggenheim Collection in Venice.       
         Pat Hearn, one of the leading art dealers of the last two decades, a founder of the Gramercy International Art Fair and a pioneer of the art scene in the East Village, SoHo and Chelsea, died on Friday at her vacation home in Provincetown, Mass. She was 45 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was liver cancer, said her husband, Colin de Land.         In her 17 years as a dealer, Ms. Hearn was widely respected as unusually empathetic to artists, open to new art and willing to share artists and ideas with other dealers. When her cancer was first diagnosed and it seemed that her insurance company would not cover her treatment (although it eventually paid for some of it), her friends organized a benefit to which hundreds of artists and dealers donated work and money.         Her gallery was in some ways a continually evolving artwork in which everything, from the 1950's-ish cursive letterhead to the furniture and design of her different spaces, expressed a distinct personality and sensibility. Yet none of this competed with the art on view, which reflected an eclectic mix of artistic generations and media -- painting, Conceptual Art and video art -- and a viewpoint that evolved from somewhat kitschy neo-pop to neo-geo to an ecumenical feminism.         The artists to whom Ms. Hearn gave first shows, or first New York shows, included the painters Philip Taffee, Milan Kunc, Peter Schuyff, Jutta Koether, Monique Prieto and, most recently, Jeff Elrod, and the Conceptualists Susan Hiller, Renee Green, Lincoln Tobier and Simon Leung. She showed artists she knew from her school days in Boston, including the painter George Condo, the installation artist Jack Pierson and the photographer Mark Morrisroe, and fostered the careers of such older artists as the painter Mary Heilmann, the video artist Joan Jonas and the Conceptualist Lutz Bacher. She was especially proud that she was able to mount posthumous shows of the work of Eva Hesse and Ana Mendieta.         Behind all this was a very complex woman, at once sophisticated and wholesome, stringent in her taste, yet extremely generous. Slim, dark-haired and usually dressed in a stylish mixture of designer and vintage clothes, Ms. Hearn resembled a bohemian Holly Golightly. In the early years she was usually trailed around her gallery by a nervous, adoring Chihuahua named Chi-Chi. She liked to give Easter Sunday parties and in the late 90's she held an annual Christmas party, complete with decorated tree, in her Chelsea gallery.         Ms. Hearn was born in Providence, R.I.. She studied painting and video at the Boston Museum School, sang with a band called Wild and Wonderful, and had a brief encounter with performance art before becoming an art dealer. She spent a year in Paris on a travel grant from the museum school in 1981, and while working at an alternative space called Usine Pali Kao began to realize that she was more interested in other artists' work than in her own. She returned to Boston, and while living on unemployment insurance, started a performance space in her home -- a ground-floor room in the Hemenway Hotel -- that she and her friends called the Poly Cow. A few months later she left for New York and a few months after that, in November of 1983, she opened her first gallery.         In terms of location, Ms. Hearn tended to be the first art dealer on the block. When most East village galleries were situated between First Avenue and Avenue A, she opened on Avenue B and Sixth Street and then expanded to a big SoHo-style space with polished wood floors on Ninth Street near Avenue D. In 1988 she moved to the relatively gallery-free southwest corner of SoHo, on Wooster Street near Grand, which soon teemed with new, experimental galleries. And in 1995, hers was one of three galleries to open on a deserted stretch of West 22nd Street in the wilds of west Chelsea on the same snowy February night. The other two were the Matthew Mark Gallery and the Morris-Healy Gallery, and the joint opening signaled a radical reshuffling of the downtown art scene that would eventually bring nearly 150 new galleries to Chelsea.         The year before, Ms. Hearn, Mr. Marks and Paul Morris of Morris-Healy had begun to explore the idea of a New York art fair for younger dealers. The result was the Gramercy International, a lively, live-in fair that took place at the Gramercy Hotel on Lexington Avenue and 21st Street for five years before graduating to larger spaces. The 2001 Gramercy International will be held on Pier 90 and will include 160 participants, nearly double the number of last year's fair at the Javits Center.         Ms. Hearn's first marriage ended in divorce. She and Mr. de Land, whose SoHo gallery, American Fine Arts, is as much an art piece as her own, were married last year after almost 10 years together.         In addition to Mr. de Land, Ms. Hearn is survived by her mother, Alice Darcy Hearn of Cranston, R.I.; two sisters, Marie, of Providence, and Marion, of Warren, R.I.; and two brothers, John, of Providence, and William J., of Cranston.       
         Dawn Langley Simmons, an author whose tumultuous life included a sex change operation and an interracial marriage that scandalized her adopted hometown, Charleston, S.C., died on Sept. 18 at her daughter's home there. She was 77.         Mrs. Simmons, who was the adopted child of the English actress Margaret Rutherford, had Parkinson's disease, said her daughter, Natasha.         Mrs. Simmons was the author of more than 20 books, including novels, biographies, and books for her children. Several of her books understandably touched on her life experiences, given a journey that started on an English estate, touched down on an Indian reservation and stirred deep turmoil in civil-rights-era Charleston.         Jack Hitt, a journalist who grew up in Charleston across the street from Mrs. Simmons and wrote about her for GQ magazine, remembered her as a figure with a piercing stare, a pillbox hat and ''a Dippity-Do hairstyle -- a dowdy doppelganger of Jackie Kennedy.''         Mrs. Simmons was a person around whom legends swirled, Mr. Hitt said. She lived in a grand house filled with antiques and with a hidden garden. She was said to have had a coming-out party for two of her dogs, who were displayed on velvet cushions in the living room, dressed in chenille, long gloves and pearls.         Mrs. Simmons was named Gordon Langley Hall when she was born, at Sissinghurst, the estate of the writer Vita Sackville-West, in Heathfield, Sussex, England. Gordon was the illegitimate child of Jack Copper, Sackville-West's chauffeur (a grandfather was Rudyard Kipling's gardener) and Marjorie Hall Ticehurst, who came, Mrs. Simmons always said, from a high social class.         Mrs. Simmons said she was born with an adrenal abnormality that causes the female genitalia to resemble a man's and was thus raised as a boy. She always maintained that she was -- unequivocally -- female.         As a boy, young Gordon played with Sackville-West's son, Nigel Nicolson. Mr. Nicolson remembered Gordon in a telephone conversation from England last Friday. ''We called him 'Dinky,' and I always think of him that way,'' he said, adding that young Gordon always looked like a boy.         At Sissinghurst, the young Gordon met Virginia Woolf, Ms. Sackville-West's lover and the author of ''Orlando,'' a novel about a boy who changes into a beautiful woman. ''Had she lived a little longer, Vita would have been intrigued to know that the child 'Dinky,' as she called me, would become a real-life Orlando,'' Mrs. Simmons wrote in her memoir, ''Dawn: A Charleston Legend,''(1995, Wyrick & Company).         In his late teens, Mr. Hall emigrated to Ontario, where he worked as a missionary, teacher and midwife among the Ojibwa Indians, according to his book about his experiences, ''Me Papoose Sitter'' (Crowell, 1955). He became an editor for The Winnipeg Free Press, and from 1953 to 1956 was society editor of The Nevada Daily Mail in Missouri. Mr. Nicolson said he was ''a very good journalist.''         He also wrote books about Princess Margaret, Jacqueline Kennedy and American Evangelism. According to the reference work ''Contemporary Authors,'' a critic named W. H. Archer praised Mr. Hall's ''Rose for Mrs. Lincoln: A Biography of Mary Todd Lincoln'' (Beacon Press, 1970), calling it ''scrupulously researched'' and written in ''a charmingly premeditated style.''         In New York in his 20's, Mr. Hall met Margaret Rutherford, who became enchanted with him and, with her husband, Stringer Davis, adopted him.         In that period Mr. Hall also befriended the painter Isabel Whitney, who left him $2 million at her death in 1962, he said. Around that time, he moved to Charleston, settling into a faded 1840 house on Society Street in the Ansonborough section, which had a large gay population. He became friendly with Charleston's grandes dames, restored his house and filled it with Chippendale furniture, mirrors said to belong to George Washington, and bed steps said to have been owned by Robert E. Lee.         In 1968 he underwent a sex change operation at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, and became Dawn Pepita Langley Hall.         The following year Dawn Hall married her 22-year-old black butler, John-Paul Simmons. The publisher of ''Dawn: A Charleston Legend'' was quoted as calling it the first documented interracial marriage in Charleston's history. A bomb threat forced the couple to move the wedding from a Baptist church to the bride's home, and the gifts were destroyed by a firebomb.         In England, Miss Rutherford was reported to have said, ''I am delighted that Gordon has become a woman, and I am delighted that Dawn is to marry a man of another race, and I am delighted that Dawn is to marry a man of a lower station, but I understand the man is a Baptist!''         Soon, Mrs. Simmons appeared to be pregnant. Then in 1972, she began strolling with a baby carriage bearing a little girl whom she called Natasha.         That was the final straw for many people in Charleston. Mrs. Simmons claimed that a white man broke into her house wearing a ski mask and beat her, breaking her nose and foot and necessitating hospitalization.         She also said that her husband beat her. In 1974, after a period of turbulence in which she accused her husband of selling her belongings to buy whisky, the family moved to Catskill, N.Y. Some time later, Mr. Simmons was confined to a mental institution near Albany. His daughter says he is now an outpatient.         Mrs. Simmons spent most of her later years in Hudson, N.Y., where she was an active member of a local Episcopal church and a leader of its youth group. She continued to support her husband and daughter on her meager earnings as a writer.         Her daughter said she would prefer not to discuss her mother's past. ''I would like her to be remembered as the grandmother that she was, as a family woman,'' Ms. Simmons said. ''She was devoted to my children.''         In addition to her husband and daughter, Mrs. Simmons is survived by three grandchildren.         After she published ''Dawn: A Charleston Legend'' in 1995, her childhood friend, Mr. Nicolson, reminisced about her in The Spectator. ''I have maligned her in the past, mocked her strange fate and refused to meet her,'' he wrote.         ''She had asked me for help in arranging an English marriage,'' he wrote, ''and when she called on me, I hid.'' On a trip to Charleston, he avoided meeting her, but saw her on television. ''I saw on the wall behind her photographs of my mother,'' he continued. ''For the first time I was touched.''         But ''there is not a word of reproach for me in her book,'' Mr. Nicolson marveled. ''Like everything else about Dinky, it is gallant, resilient and unfailingly generous.''       
         Janice Brustlein, whose painting career, pursued under the name Biala, spanned two art capitals and several generations, died on Sept. 24 at her home in Paris. She was 97 and had lived in Paris since 1958.         She was known for cryptic, lusciously painted interiors, still lifes, landscapes and street scenes that hovered between abstraction and representation. They belonged to a trans-Atlantic tradition that included French painters like Matisse, Bonnard and Marquet, as well as Milton Avery and Edward Hopper. She might also be grouped with artists like Loren MacIver, Fairfield Porter and Anne Poor, who borrowed from the abstract tendencies of the New York School while concentrating on their immediate surroundings.         Always carrying a sketchbook, Biala drew her subjects from her homes and studios, the cities she lived in and the places she visited, including Cape Cod, Venice, the French Riviera and Fire Island. Although she preferred to live in Paris, her career was based in New York, where she had regular gallery shows beginning in the 1940's.         Biala was described by her niece, the New York painter Hermine Ford,  as a ''uniquely wonderful, widely beloved character'' whose house in Paris ''would fill in the late afternoon with all kinds of people -- writers, artists, next-door neighbors.'' Her close friends included the photographer Cartier-Bresson, as well as the expatriate American painter Shirley Jaffe. She knew literary Paris as well, having lived there with the English novelist Ford Madox Ford from the late 1920's until his death in 1939, during which time she illustrated some of his novels.         Biala rarely revisited her complicated past -- refusing several offers from potential biographers -- and as a result its facts are not always clear. Neither Ms. Ford, or her sister Helen Tworkov, a founding editor of Tricycle magazine, remember the name their aunt was given at birth.  She was born in 1903, the daughter of a Jewish tailor named Tworkovsky in Biala, a village on the Russian-Polish border. Her father soon left for New York, where he set up a shop on Ludlow Street in the Lower East Side; Biala, her mother and her older brother Jacob, who would become the Abstract Expressionist painter Jack Tworkov, followed in 1913.         While both nieces contend that Biala knew she wanted to be a painter from a very early age (before her brother did, in fact), all they know of her artistic education is that at the age of 18 or 19, after a brief period of study at the National Academy of Design, she went to Provincetown, Mass., to study with the painter Edwin Dickinson, whose painterly representation was especially influential on her work. By then she was already living on her own, supporting herself with menial jobs and becoming familiar with Greenwich Village bohemia. Sometime in the mid-1920's she was briefly married to the painter Lee Gatch. After that, a wealthy couple interested in art paid her expenses on a trip to Paris, where she met Ford and became a Francophile.         In 1943, having returned to New York, Biala married Daniel Brustlein, an Alsatian-born painter who contributed cartoons to The New Yorker under the name Alain. Over the next 15 years the couple split their time between Paris and New York. (The McCarran Act did not permit naturalized citizens to live abroad for more than two years at a time.) Their New York circle included Jack and Wally Tworkov, Harold and May Rosenberg, Willem and Elaine de Kooning, Saul Steinberg and Hedda Sterne and Rudy Burckhardt. Mr. Brustlein died in 1996.         Biala's first exhibition was at the Passedoit Gallery in Manhattan in 1936, by which point, it is thought, she had already taken the name of her birthplace. She exhibited at the Stable Gallery, an important artists' cooperative, in 1954, 1956 and 1961. In the 1970's and 80's she was represented by the Gruenebaum Gallery in New York and in the 1990's by the Kouros Gallery, where she had her most recent show in 1999.         Despite her love of Paris, Biala never gave up her United States citizenship. She was at home everywhere. ''I never have the feeling of nationality or roots,'' she once said. ''I always had the feeling that I belong where my easel is.''       
         Mary Sinclair, an actress who was a familiar face to television viewers in the 1950's, died on Nov. 5 in Phoenix. She was 78 and lived in Phoenix.         The cause of death was not disclosed.         Ms. Sinclair, whom Life magazine called ''a hazel-eyed beauty,'' was born in San Diego and became a Los Angeles fashion model but forsook Hollywood for New York.         ''I was the arty type,'' she recalled in a 1951 interview with The New York Times. ''I wanted to go to New York and be a real actress.'' She made the move in 1944 and worked as a model and in summer stock.         In 1946 she married George Abbott, the Broadway producer and director. In the 40's she also began to acquire valuable experience as a freelance television actress, appearing on 36 programs in two years.         In 1951 Ms. Sinclair signed a seven-year CBS television contract. The Times reported that she was the first dramatic actress ''to enter video's incubator for hatching its own stars.'' Later that year, she divorced Mr. Abbott.         Ms. Sinclair usually played sweet, goody-goody characters on television. But not long after signing with CBS, she played quite different parts on three successive evenings: a vicious singer, a spiteful flapper and a libidinous shrew.         As a star, she appeared on many live drama programs, like ''The U.S. Steel Hour,'' ''Studio One'' and ''Playhouse 90,'' which had their heyday in the 50's. She was dazed by the number of men she had to kiss on-screen and said, ''I average two strangers a week.''         She also appeared with Charlton Heston in Paramount's 1953 Western  ''Arrowhead,'' but continued working in television and on the stage. In the 60's she faded from television screens. Later she became a painter of portraits, animals and flowers and lived in Europe and in Los Angeles, where she was a director of local theater productions.         She is survived by a brother.
