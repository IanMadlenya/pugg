        Gladys Vaughan, the first woman to direct a New York Shakespeare Festival production, died Dec. 30 in her home in Manhattan. She was 64 years old.         Gladys Vaughan, the first woman to direct a New York Shakespeare Festival production, died Dec. 30 in her home in Manhattan. She was 64 years old.         For some time Mrs. Vaughan had been suffering from Cushing's disease, a disorder of the adrenal cortex.         She made her directorial debut in Central Park in 1961 when she staged Shakespeare's ''Richard II,'' starring Ben Hayes and J. D. Cannon. She had first gone to work for the festival's founder, Joseph Papp, as an unpaid volunteer, cutting scripts, sewing costumes and collecting props.         She subsequently directed several festival productions. In 1962 she directed a touring company production of ''Macbeth'' and co-directed ''King Lear'' with Mr. Papp. She also staged ''The Winter's Tale'' (1963), ''Othello'' (1964), ''Coriolanus'' (1965) and ''Macbeth'' (1966).         Mrs. Vaughan taught Shakespearean acting at the festival and at Circle in the Square Theater School. She took up painting in 1970 and worked in the Abstract Expressionist style in Los Angeles and New York.         Mrs. Vaughan's marriage to the director Stuart Vaughan ended in divorce. She is survived by her brother, Eugene Vernon Regier of Vancouver, British Columbia.       
        Patricia Anne Hoffman Friedman, executive vice president and a partner in International Contract Furnishings, an importer and manufacturer of modern office and residential furniture, died of cancer Tuesday at New York Hospital. She was 44 years old.         Patricia Anne Hoffman Friedman, executive vice president and a partner in International Contract Furnishings, an importer and manufacturer of modern office and residential furniture, died of cancer Tuesday at New York Hospital. She was 44 years old.         An interior and furniture designer, Pat Hoffman, as she was known professionally, was influential in introducing avant-garde and early 20th-century European designs to the United States.         Ms. Hoffman was born March 7, 1943, in Detroit and graduated from the University of Michigan's College of Architecture and Design. From 1965 to 1970, she worked as director of design for Koch & Lowy, a lighting firm in New York City. After spending two years in Rome working for an architectural firm, Ms. Hoffman returned to New York to join I.C.F., in charge of the company's design programs, including graphics, advertising and showroom design.         For the last 15 years, Ms. Hoffman was instrumental in introducing designs that quickly became synonymous with the avant-garde. In the early 1970's, that included Giovanetti's Anfibio sofa, by Alessandro Becchi, an oversize leather upholstered raftlike sofa bed from Italy and the Interlubke system, a sleek German storage system. Introduced International Designs         Most influential in the modern home furnishings field was Ms. Hoffman's introduction in 1975 of the furniture designs by Josef Hoffmann, the Viennese leader of the early 20th-century Wiener Werkstatte movement. The Hoffmann furniture designs were pivotal in the rediscovery and revival of many other early 20th-century classics and played a critical role in the current interest in this important period of 20th-century design.         A lamp Ms. Hoffman designed in 1969 was exhibited in ''High Styles: 20th-Century American Design'' at the Whitney Museum of American Art in 1985. Some of her other furniture designs have been shown at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago, as well as at the Mobelmesse, in Cologne, West Germany, the Salon International de Meubles in Paris and the Saloni di Mobili in Milan.         Ms. Hoffman is survived by her husband, Samuel Friedman, president of I.C.F.; her parents, John and Mae Hoffman of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and a sister, Jane Knaus.         The funeral will be held tomorrow at 11:30 A.M. at Frank E. Campbell, 1076 Madison Avenue, at 81st Street.       
        Colleen Moore, the star of the silent screen who personified the ''flapper'' of the 1920's, died of cancer yesterday at her ranch near Paso Robles, Calif. She was 85 years old. Miss Moore appeared in about 100 films beginning in 1917 and ending with one of her comparatively few talking pictures, ''The Scarlet Letter,'' in 1937.         Colleen Moore, the star of the silent screen who personified the ''flapper'' of the 1920's, died of cancer yesterday at her ranch near Paso Robles, Calif. She was 85 years old. Miss Moore appeared in about 100 films beginning in 1917 and ending with one of her comparatively few talking pictures, ''The Scarlet Letter,'' in 1937. But it was in the Roaring Twenties that she put her stamp on American social history, creating in dozens of films the image of the wide-eyed, insouciant flapper with her bobbed hair and short skirts.         There was one other distinction known to every fan, even in the days before Technicolor: she had one brown eye and one blue eye. The eyes sparkled at audiences the world over beginning with the 1923 hit that made her big splash, ''Flaming Youth.'' Her Dutch bob was soon copied by hairdressers across America and her air of an emancipated young woman inspired countless imitations. Actress, Trend-Setter and Author         Miss Moore was at the vanguard of fashion's first revolution of the 20th century as skirts rose above the knee, bosoms vanished and waistlines slid down to the hips.         There followed such films as ''The Perfect Flapper,'' ''Naughty but Nice,'' ''Little Orphan Annie,'' and ''We Moderns.'' Her favorite, she said shortly after the end of her career, was a talkie, ''The Power and the Glory,'' which co-starred Spencer Tracy.         At the height of her popularity she earned a million dollars a year from films and she was also an author, writing ''Silent Star,'' her autobiography and ''How Women Can Make Money in the Stock Market.'' In another work, ''Colleen Moore's Doll House,'' she dealt with an elaborate miniature doll house she built in the mid-1920's that cost $470,000 and was designed in the form of a castle, complete with electricity, running water, an organ and a radio. The doll house later was sent around the country for display in department stores to raise money for charity.         Miss Moore was born Kathleen Morrison in Michigan on Aug. 19, 1902. She arrived in Hollywood at age 15 when an uncle arranged a screen test with the director D. W. Griffith. She wanted to be a second Lillian Gish, playing dramatic roles, but instead found herself playing pure-as-snow heroines in Westerns with stars like Tom Mix. She later observed that she usually came out second best to the star's horse. 'A New Type Was Born'         She had long, curly hair then, but at her mother's suggestion in 1923 she cut the curls off and landed the part of the flapper.         ''Here was a chance for a girl who had straight hair, who was not buxom and not a great beauty,'' she told an interviewer half a century later. ''A new type was born - the American girl.''         In 1926, three years after her flapper had burst upon the screen, Miss Moore wrote: ''Don't worry, girls. No edict of fashion arbiters will ever swathe you in long and cumbersome skirts.'' She added: ''The American girl will see to this. She is independent, a thinker will not follow slavishly the ordinances of those who in the past have decreed this or that for her to wear.''         Although she started the short-skirt fad with her appearances on screen, Miss Moore at first dressed quite differently in private life, favoring jeans, baggy sweaters and saddle shoes. But when she became a national fixture as the flapper, a designer friend accused her of being the worst-dressed woman in Hollywood. She took the criticism to heart and changed her manner of dress, managing to look both the all-American girl and chic and urbane.         In 1937 she married Homer Hargrave, a stockbroker, her third husband, and ended her film career. She had previously been married to a film producer, John McCormick, and a New York broker, Albert F. Scott. Mr. Hargrave was a widower with two children, whom she came to consider her own. He died in 1967.         Four years later Miss Moore hired a builder, Paul Maginot, to construct a home in Hidden Valley south of Paso Robles. In 1983 she and Mr. Maginot were married.         Her husband survives, as does her son, Homer Hargrave Jr. of Paso Robles; her daugher, Mrs. Roger Jackson Coleman, several grandchildren and several great-grandchildren.

Mab Wilson Moltke, a former advertising and publicity executive in New York, died Jan. 1 at her home in Blackrock, County Dublin, after a long illness. She was 78 years old and had moved to Ireland in 1970.         Mrs. Moltke, a native of San Francisco, began her career in New York with Saks Fifth Avenue and Vogue. She was the magazine's beauty editor in 1941 when Bergdorf Goodman appointed her advertising director.         In World War II, she went overseas for the Office of War Information. Posted in Stockholm, she met Count Carl Adam Moltke, a member of the Danish underground, who became her second husband in 1944.         Mrs. Moltke, known professionally as Mab Wilson, was director of publicity at Tiffany & Company in 1968 when she rejoined Bergdorf Goodman as director of advertising and publicity.

        Members of the dance and theater worlds gathered yesterday afternoon at the City Center to honor Nora Kaye, the American ballerina who died last year. Known for her dramatic power, Ms. Kaye, who was born in New York City in 1920, was a member of American Ballet Theater from its inception in 1940 until 1951, and again from 1954 to 1959.         Members of the dance and theater worlds gathered yesterday afternoon at the City Center to honor Nora Kaye, the American ballerina who died last year. Known for her dramatic power, Ms. Kaye, who was born in New York City in 1920, was a member of American Ballet Theater from its inception in 1940 until 1951, and again from 1954 to 1959. In between, she appeared with the New York City Ballet. Celebrated for her interpretations of the psychological ballets of Antony Tudor, she also danced in works by Agnes de Mille and Jerome Robbins.         The memorial included speeches by two ballerinas: Alicia Alonso, the Cuban dancer who was part of American Ballet Theater from 1940 until 1955, and Dame Margot Fonteyn, the former star of England's Royal Ballet. ''In her dance,'' Ms. Alonso said of Ms. Kaye, ''there was life always.'' Dame Margot called Ms. Kaye ''the most wonderful friend - understanding, perceptive, encouraging.''         Mr. Robbins analyzed Ms. Kaye's dramatic gift, saying that he believed she was theatrically striking not because she was flamboyant, but because of her gestural economy. Mr. Robbins recalled how last summer, while sitting at a cafe in Spoleto, Italy, he fancied he saw Ms. Kaye pass by.         Other tributes came from Leo Lerman, the theatrical writer; Mike Nichols, the director, and John Taras, Ballet Theater's associate director. Several speakers recalled how Ms. Kaye assisted her second husband, Herbert Ross, the choreographer and director, in his theatrical and film projects. Musical Tributes, as Well         Ms. Kaye had been married first to the violinist Isaac Stern. Mr. Stern was present to play Mozart's Violin Sonata in E minor, with Leonard Bernstein as pianist. Other musical selections included songs by Bernadette Peters and Barbara Cook. Leslie Browne and Robert Hill, of Ballet Theater, offered an excerpt from Tudor's ''Leaves Are Fading.''         The afternoon's touching conclusion came when Lynn Seymour, a British ballerina whose intensity has been likened to that of Ms. Kaye, danced Sir Frederick Ashton's ''Five Brahms Waltzes in the Manner of Isadora Duncan.'' When she stepped forward scattering rose petals, she could have been offering a floral tribute to Ms. Kaye.         Then, with Mr. Bernstein at the piano, Stephanie Friede sang ''Im Abendrot,'' one of Richard Strauss's ''Four Last Songs,'' which accompanied Tudor's ''Hail and Farewell,'' his last ballet for Ms. Kaye. It had been given its premiere by the Metropolitan Opera Ballet in 1959, with Ms. Kaye as guest artist; she retired in 1961. Possessing a theme that symbolized death and transfiguration, ''Im Abendrot'' sounded especially eloquent.

        Isabel Bishop, a painter and printmaker, died of Parkinson's disease Friday at her home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. She was 85 years old.         Isabel Bishop, a painter and printmaker, died of Parkinson's disease Friday at her home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx. She was 85 years old.         Best known for her insight into the everyday activities of American women, young and old, and for her studies of life as it was lived in and near Union Square from 1930 until the present day, Miss Bishop was the living continuation of a specific and distinctively American idiom.         That idiom, which was pioneered at the turn of this century by Robert Henri, Everett Shinn, George Luks, John Sloan and others, was reportorial in style, anecdotal in tone and shorn of all extraneous or merely complimentary material. It was intended to seize a moment, tell a tale, and give a renewed dignity to people for whom high art in this country had not often had a place. A Perceptive Observer         On the street corner, in the automat, in the subway and on park benches in fine weather, Miss Bishop proved herself a perceptive observer. For young women in the big city who were as yet unmarked by life, she had a particular feeling. But she was alert to the potential both for happiness and for an irrevocable, untold misery that exists at every stage of metropolitan life.         For all the rapid, spontaneous, firsthand qulity of her observation, she knew how to reach back into European Old Master painting for support and encouragement. John H. Baur, former director of the Whitney Museum of American Art, once said of her work that ''in some mysterious manner which I do not really understand, her paintings carry forward the great tradition of north European 17th-century figure painting.''         Miss Bishop cherished that connection, and once said that ''you may have true gifts and the ability to make something that is new and surprising, but if your work hasn't any connections and your gift gives out, you haven't any leverage.'' Optimistic Viewpoint         When she first came to New York in the early 1920s, determined to become an artist, Miss Bishop studied at the Art Students League with Kenneth Hayes Miller and Guy Pene du Bois, both of whom had studied with Robert Henri.         From Pene du Bois, and later from her close friend, the painter Reginald Marsh, Miss Bishop learned to sharpen and perfect her sense of a New York subject. But neither age nor familiarity ever eroded her inherently optimistic approach to life. In her late work, it was as apparent as ever she had an unsentimental confidence that one day, somehow, the lot of women in the city would be changed for the better, Miss Bishop was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on March 3, 1902, the daughter of John Remsen Bishop, a schoolmaster, and his wife, Anna Bartram Bishop. Her father moved his large family from Princeton to the Midwest in hopes of giving them a more comfortable life. The failure of this venture, and the experience of genteel poverty in Detroit, gave her a lifelong sympathy with underprivileged people. Moved to New York in 1918         In 1918 she moved to New York and studied at the New York School of Applied Design for Women. Shortly after leaving the Art Students League in 1924, she began to work in the Union Square area, where she eventually took rank as the unofficial but unquestioned visual historian.         In 1932, she joined the Midtown Gallery in Manhattan, with which she remained closely affiliated for the rest of her life.

Now, the villages in Canterbury and Sabbathday Lake are the only ones with living Shakers. There are five undisputed shakers in Maine, and others admitted as new members. The Canterbury village has admitted no new members since 1965.         Services for Miss Soule will be held Tuesday at the Dwelling House Chapel at the village, Mr. Kathmann said.

Miss Soule died in her sleep at the Canterbury Shaker Village, one of two remaining Shaker villages with Shakers, Richard Kathmann, director of the village, said Sunday.         Miss Soule's death leaves Sister Ethel Hudson, 92, and Eldress Bertha Lindsay, 90, as the last Shakers in a community that once numbered 400 men, women and children.         Miss Soule was born in Topsham, Me. At the age of 11, she and her sister were placed with the Shaker community at Sabbathday Lake, Me., after the death of their mother. Chose to Remain         She chose to remain with the community when she turned 21 and signed the Shaker vow of celibacy. In the early 1950's, she became an eldress, or spiritual leader, of the Sabbathday Lake Society. In 1957, she was appointed to the Lead Ministry of the United Society of Believers.         She moved to the Canterbury Shaker Village in 1972 to assume further responsibilities as a member of the Lead Ministry and served as vice president of the nonprofit educational corporation and museum that administers the historic site founded in the 1780's.         Miss Soule frequently told stories to the children visiting the museum. Her favorite was about an orphaned seal pup she helped raise when she lived with her father. They kept the seal in the family bathtub.         Famous for their simple, efficient creations, including the flat broom, clothespin and ladderback chairs, Shakers once numbered 6,000 at 24 communities throughout the country.         Now, the villages in Canterbury and Sabbathday Lake are the only ones with living Shakers.         Services for Miss Soule will be held Tuesday at the Dwelling House Chapel at the village, Mr. Kathmann said.       
        Cleo Hartwig, a sculptor whose works featuring animals, birds and other natural subjects were inspired by her childhood in rural Michigan, died of cancer of the pancreas yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 80 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Cleo Hartwig, a sculptor whose works featuring animals, birds and other natural subjects were inspired by her childhood in rural Michigan, died of cancer of the pancreas yesterday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 80 years old and lived in Manhattan.         Miss Hartwig's work is in the permanent collections of many American museums, including the National Academy of Design, the National Museum of American Art at the Smithsonian Institution and the Pennsylvania Academy of Fine Arts.         Miss Hartwig, a petite woman who wore her hair in a trademark ponytail, was a sculpture instructor at the Montclair Art Museum in Montclair, N.J., from 1945 to 1971 and had previously taught sculpture at Cooper Union. Her work was usually carved from wood or stone, and she was sculpturing until shortly before she died, said Renata Manasse Schwebel, a fellow sculptor and longtime friend.         She was known among her colleagues as a woman who shunned the limelight herself but was a fervid supporter of other artists' careers.         ''When you met her, you thought she was a very shy, little birdie of a person,'' Ms. Schwebel said. ''Underneath it, if you ever tried to change her mind, she was total stainless steel.''         Miss Hartwig studied at Western Michigan University, the Art Institute of Chicago and the International School of Art in Manhattan.         In 1951, she married Vincent Glinsky, a sculptor, who was a founding member of the Sculptors Guild in Manhattan. For many years they shared a studio on West 16th Street. Mr. Glinsky died in 1975.         Miss Hartwig was a director of the National Sculpture Society, and the society's annual exhibition last year included two of her works: ''Owlet,'' a 1969 work in white Tennessee marble, and ''Guinea Fowl,'' a bronze executed in 1986.         She is survived by a son, Albert Glinsky of Manhattan.         The funeral will be private, and a memorial service is planned for a later date.       
        Marta Abba, a leading Italian stage performer of the 1920's and 30's and the lifetime companion of the playwright Luigi Pirandello, died after suffering a stroke on her 88th birthday Friday in a Milan nursing home, her family announced today.         Marta Abba, a leading Italian stage performer of the 1920's and 30's and the lifetime companion of the playwright Luigi Pirandello, died after suffering a stroke on her 88th birthday Friday in a Milan nursing home, her family announced today.         Miss Abba entered Milan's drama school when she was 15 and began her career in 1923 with the stage company of the director Ettore Paladini. She drew acclaim the following year in Virgilio Talli's production of Anton Chekhov's ''Gabbiano.''         In 1925, she became the lead actress for Pirandello, the ground-breaking dramatist whose work often focused on the thin line between illusion and reality. Pirandello, who was awarded the 1934 Nobel Prize in Literature, is considered by many to be one of the great writers of the 20th century European theater. Toured Together         After spending years in Rome performing such Pirandello plays as ''Six Characters in Search of An Author,'' the playwright and Miss Abba went on tour in Italy and abroad, including the United States, France, Britain and Germany.         Pirandello wrote several plays specifically for Miss Abba, including ''As You Desire Me'' in 1930.         In 1928-29, Miss Abba formed her own company of young actors, mostly performing plays of her mentor. In the 1930's, she expanded her repertory to include Shakespeare, Shaw and others. Married After Playwright's Death         Pirandello died in 1936. Two years later, Miss Abba married an American, S. A. Millikin, grandson of a Cleveland steel baron. She retired and settled in the United States.         After the marriage broke up, she moved back to Milan in 1953, returning briefly to the stage with a company in her own name.         She served on the board of the Institute of Pirandello Studies and Contemporary Italian Theater since 1962.         Two years ago, Miss Abba donated to Princeton University the 560 letters that Pirandello had written her.         Funeral services for Miss Abba are scheduled Monday in Milan.

Ella Raines, an actress who starred in film dramas, comedies and westerns during the 1940's, died of throat cancer May 30 in Los Angeles. She was 67 years old.         Ms. Raines's film career took off in 1943. That year she starred opposite Randolph Scott in the wartime thriller ''Corvette K-255'' and became the only actress under contract to a new $1 million production company founded by Howard Hawks and Charles Boyer. Her best-known starring role was in the suspense film ''Phantom Lady'' in 1944. More often she appeared opposite some of the leading actors of the day, including John Wayne in ''Tall in the Saddle'' (1944), Charles Laughton in ''Suspect'' (1945) and William Powell in the Charles MacArthur-George S. Kaufman satire ''The Senator Was Indiscreet'' (1947). Worked With Preston Sturges         She also worked with the director Preston Sturges in ''Hail the Conquering Hero'' (1944). She starred in a television show, ''Janet Dean, R.N.'' in 1953-54. More recently, she appeared in an episode of television's ''Matt Houston,'' although she had largely been in retirement.         A two-year marriage to her high-school sweetheart, Kenneth Trout, a lieutenant in the Army Air Force, ended in divorce in 1945. In 1947 she married an Air Force major, Robin Olds. A hero in World War II and Vietnam, he later became a brigadier general and commander of the United States Air Force Academy at Colorado Springs. They had two daughters.         After her marriage, Ms. Raines appeared in films less frequently. In 1967, when her husband was serving in Vietnam, she characterized herself in a newspaper article as ''an Army wife'' and paid tribute to ''service wives . . . for maintaining a home that is as normal as possible for the children while keeping their worries to themselves.''         She and her husband were divorced in 1975. She is survived by her daughters, Christina Newman and Susan Olds, and a granddaughter.

Frances Midlam Kennedy, a former executive vice president of the advertising firm Saatchi & Saatchi DFS Compton, died of lung cancer Saturday at the home of her daughter in Weston, Mass. She was 75 years old and had lived in Manhattan until last fall.         With such campaigns as ''What's a woman to do'' for Total cereal and ''Bake a Gold Medal memory'' for the flour brand, Mrs. Kennedy rose to prominence in a field with few women executives. Working for what was then Dancer-Fitzgerald-Sample Inc., she was Chicago's Advertising Woman of the Year in 1960.

        Florence Eldridge, the actress who appeared with her husband, Fredric March, in several Broadway plays and movies, including ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' ''The Skin of Our Teeth'' and ''Another Part of the Forest,'' died in a hospital emergency room Monday night in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 86 years old.         Florence Eldridge, the actress who appeared with her husband, Fredric March, in several Broadway plays and movies, including ''Long Day's Journey Into Night,'' ''The Skin of Our Teeth'' and ''Another Part of the Forest,'' died in a hospital emergency room Monday night in Santa Barbara, Calif. She was 86 years old.         The immediate cause of the actress's death was not disclosed, but she had been in frail health for several years. She had lived in a condominium in Montecito, a suburb of Santa Barbara, since 1974. For many years previously, she and Mr. March, who died in 1975 at the age of 77, lived in Manhattan and on a 40-acre farm near New Milford, Conn.         Miss Eldridge, who made her New York stage debut in the chorus of Jerome Kern's ''Rockabye Baby,'' in 1918, was a versatile actress who played in touring stock companies, motion pictures and on Broadway. She Played Mary Tyrone         She topped a distinguished career on the stage in 1956 with her memorable portrayal of the tragic drug addict Mary Tyrone in Eugene O'Neill's autobiographical drama, ''Long Day's Journey Into Night.'' For that performance she was named best actress by the New York Drama Critics Circle.         Miss Eldridge was named Florence McKechnie when she was born on Sept. 5, 1901, in Brooklyn. She graduated from Girls High School and immediately set her sights on an acting career. By 1921 she had made her mark, appearing in the Theater Guild's ''Ambush'' and impelling one critic to call her ''one of the brightest chapters in the season's theatrical history.''         She became one of her era's most celebrated performers, appearing in ''The Cat and the Canary'' (1922), Pirandello's ''Six Characters in Search of an Author'' (1922), and as the neurotic and spoiled Daisy Buchanan in a stage version of F. Scott Fitzgerald's ''Great Gatsby.''         In 1927 she met and appeared opposite Mr. March in Molnar's ''The Swan,'' and they were married within the year. Then, on a repertory tour, they were not allowed to appear in the same plays together, for management considered it unromantic to have a man and wife play lovers. Ascendancy of the Voice         The Marches wound up in Los Angeles in 1928, so the actor could appear in ''The Royal Family'' at a local theater. Sound had just been introduced into films, and Hollywood was eager to give work to stage-trained actors with excellent voices, like Miss Eldridge and Mr. March, and so they settled there.         Miss Eldridge had appeared briefly in a New York-made film in 1923, but her first good movie roles came in 1929, when she made three films, ''The Studio Murder Mystery,'' co-starring Mr. March, ''Charming Sinners'' and ''The Greene Murder Case.'' During the 1930's, while her husband became a major box-office star, she appeared in several movies, including ''The Story of Temple Drake'' (1933), based on William Faulkner's ''Sanctuary,'' ''Les Miserables'' (again with Mr. March, in 1935) and ''Mary of Scotland'' (1936), in which she played Elizabeth I. The acting couple returned to Broadway in 1938 in ''Yr. Obedient Husband,'' a vehicle based on Samuel Pepys's diary, and failed so resoundingly they bought advertising space to apologize. The advertisement, in trade publications, showed the Marches as trapeze artists missing each other's grip in midair. ''Oops, sorry!'' read the caption.  In 1942, during the Broadway run of Thornton Wilder's ''Skin of Our Teeth,'' Miss Eldridge and Mr. March carried on an epic feud with their notoriously temperamental co-star, Tallulah Bankhead. The director of the play, Elia Kazan, in his recent autobiography, ''A Life,'' recalled that nightly, while Miss Eldridge was giving her main speech, Miss Bankhead would conspicuously comb her hair to upstage her. To retaliate, Mr. March stood in the wings gargling loudly while Miss Bankhead gave her big speech. Other Roles Together         In 1948 Miss Eldridge returned to Hollywood to play Mr. March's wife in Lillian Hellman's ''Another Part of the Forest.'' That same year they appeared in a daring and controversial film about euthanasia, variously called ''An Act of Mercy'' and ''An Act of Murder.'' They also acted together in ''Christopher Columbus,'' in which Miss Eldridge was seen as Queen Isabella, in 1949, and, again playing man and wife, in ''Inherit the Wind,'' in 1960.         The Marches had no children of their own, but adopted two, Anthony and Penelope. Miss Eldridge is survived by her daughter, Penelope Fantacci of Florence, Italy; five grandchildren; a great-granddaughter, and two brothers, David I. McKechnie, who lives in Oregon, and Cromwell McKechnie, of Carpenteria, Calif.

        Bonita Granville Wrather, a child film star of the 1930's and a longtime executive in the Wrather Corporation, a complex of oil, entertainment and real estate businesses founded by her husband, Jack Wrather, died of cancer yesterday at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 65 years old and had homes in Holmby Hills, Calif., and         Bonita Granville Wrather, a child film star of the 1930's and a longtime executive in the Wrather Corporation, a complex of oil, entertainment and real estate businesses founded by her husband, Jack Wrather, died of cancer yesterday at St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 65 years old and had homes in Holmby Hills, Calif., and London.         As Bonita Granville, the actress was the epitome of malevolent little girls, particularly in ''These Three,'' Lillian Hellman's heterosexual film adaptation of her play about lebsianism, ''The Children's Hour.'' The performance won the actress a 1936 Oscar nomination.         Among her more than 50 other movies were ''Ah, Wilderness!'' (1935), ''The Plough and the Stars'' (1937), ''Maid of Salem'' (1937), ''Quality Street'' (1937), ''Now Voyager'' (1942) and ''Hitler's Children'' (1943). The spunky blond actress also played the inquisitive title role in the ''Nancy Drew'' detective-reporter series. A Family of Entertainers         She was born in Manhattan on Feb. 2, 1923, into a family of entertainers and went on the stage at 3. She became a leading lady in films of the late 40's and retired from the screen in 1947 to marry Mr. Wrather. She appeared occasionally in television plays and, in 1958, became the associate producer of her husband's popular ''Lassie'' television series and later its producer.         Mr. Wrather was a founding member of the ''kitchen cabinet'' of prominent Californians who encouraged Ronald Reagan to run for Governor in 1967, and he and his wife were close friends of the Reagans. In a statment by the White House yesterday, the President and his wife lauded Mrs. Wrather as ''a warm and caring friend'' who had for so many years ''enriched our lives with her sparkling personality, her wonderful sense of humor, her loyalty and her love.''         Mrs. Wrather held a series of major executive posts in the Wrather Corporation and succeeded her husband as board chairman after his death in 1984, holding the post until last January, when the company was sold to the Walt Disney Company and Industrial Equity (Pacific) Limited, a Hong Kong investment concern. Civic Appointments         Mrs. Wrather was the chairman of the American Film Institute, a trustee of the John F. Kennedy Center and of Loyola Marymount University, a director and former president of the Los Angeles Orphanage Guild, a member of the advisory committee of the Children's Bureau of Los Angeles, a founder and board member of the Los Angeles Music Center and a board member of the Women's Council of the Public Broadcasting Service's Channel 28 there.         For her work on the ''Lassie'' television series and for talks around the country in behalf of environmental conservation, Mrs. Wrather received a Boy Scouts of America National Award and a National 4-H Congress Conservation Award.         Surviving are two daugthers, Molly Dolle and Linda Finocchiaro; a son, Christopher, and nine grandchildren, all of the Los Angeles area.       
        Georgia Graham Sargeant, a former leading dancer in the Denishawn company in the 1920's and a sister of Martha Graham, the modern-dance pioneer, died Tuesday in Tucson. She was 88 years old and had lived in Tucson for the last 10 years.         Georgia Graham Sargeant, a former leading dancer in the Denishawn company in the 1920's and a sister of Martha Graham, the modern-dance pioneer, died Tuesday in Tucson. She was 88 years old and had lived in Tucson for the last 10 years.         Known to the dance world, including hundreds of students, as Geordie Graham, she was also the director of the Martha Graham School of Contemporary Dance from the 1940's through the 1960's. In the 1930's, she married Winthrop Sargeant, who became the music and dance critic of The New Yorker magazine. They were divorced in the 1940's and Miss Graham devoted herself full-time to her administative duties at the school.         The youngest of the three Graham sisters who were born in Allegheny, Pa., and who moved to Santa Barbara, Calif., in 1908, Georgia followed Martha Graham into the Denishawn school in Los Angeles during World War I. Ruth St. Denis and Ted Shawn, considered among the founders of the modern-dance movement, enlisted the teaching talents of both Graham sisters before they recognized them as performers. A Star With Denishawn Troupe         Mr. Shawn nonetheless made Martha Graham a star in his Aztec ballet, ''Xochitl,'' only to see her leave the company in 1922. Georgia Graham, however, danced with the Denishawn Dancers until 1928, sometimes performing in the roles created by Miss St. Denis or her sister. The latter included ''Revolutionary Etude'' and the title role in 'Xochitl.'' According to a fellow Denishawn dancer, Jane Sherman, Georgia Graham stopped the show in that production.         She was a senior member of the Denishawn company on its widespread tour of Asia in 1925-26 and its transcontinental American tour in 1926-27. She also toured with the Denishawn troupe when it became part of the Ziegfeld Follies in 1928. Miss Graham was a dancer in 1931 in the early, all-female Martha Graham Dance Group. In 1933, she appeared in a theatrical production directed by Martha Graham, ''Six Miracle Plays.''         She is survived by her sister.

Alma Cunningham, retired vice president of fashion design for the Simplicity Pattern Company, one of the world's leading manufacturers of paper patterns for clothing, died of breast cancer on Oct. 10 at a hospital in Dallas. She was 78 years old and lived in Dallas.         Mrs. Cunningham joined Simplicity at its headquarters in Manhattan in 1960 as editor of its pattern catalogues. She became a vice president in the late 1960's and retired in 1975.         Earlier in her career she had been a fashion editor for Good Housekeeping magazine and a fashion editor of The Dallas Morning News. In 1947 she became the first director of the newly formed regional chapter of the Dallas Fashion Group Inc., a world-wide organization of women in fashion and related industries. She later became a board member of the international Fashion Group organization, a post she maintained until 1982.         She is survived by her mother, Julia Whitley of Dallas; a son, Bruce, of Tokyo; a granddaughter, and two great-grandchildren.       
        When asked, after a trip to Egypt, how she liked the pyramids, the sculptor Louise Nevelson replied, ''Too small.'' The response, said the art dealer Arnold Glimcher, typified her sense of ''grandeur,'' her ''great expectations'' for herself and everyone around her.         When asked, after a trip to Egypt, how she liked the pyramids, the sculptor Louise Nevelson replied, ''Too small.'' The response, said the art dealer Arnold Glimcher, typified her sense of ''grandeur,'' her ''great expectations'' for herself and everyone around her.         Mr. Glimcher's anecdote was one of many wonderful stories told about the irreverent and irrepressible sculptor at a memorial service held yesterday in the Medieval Court of the Metropolitan Museum. Mrs. Nevelson died at her home in SoHo on April 17 at the age of 88.         Among the more than 250 people who attended were stellar figures from the worlds of art, fashion and the movies. They included the artists Jasper Johns, Marisol, Claes Oldenburg, George Segal and Saul Steinberg; the art dealer Leo Castelli; the actress Sigourney Weaver; the musician John Cage; the couturier Arnold Scaasi; the photographer Arnold Newman, and the museum directors Philippe de Montebello, Richard Oldenburg and Robert Buck, along with William Luers, the Metropolitan's president. Also in attendance were Mrs. Nevelson's son, Mike Nevelson; her sister-in-law, Lillian Berliawsky, and her longtime assistant, Diana McKown. Between tributes spoken by friends, a quintet played music by Beethoven, Mozart and Ludwig Thuille, a 19th-century German composer. Rearranging 'Mountain Woman'         At the gathering, William Lieberman, director of the department of 20th-century art at the Met, described Mrs. Nevelson as ''a great artist, a wonderful woman, an elegant lady and a good and generous friend.''         Mr. Glimcher, Mrs. Nevelson's dealer for many years, drew laughter from the guests by telling of her reluctance to exhibit ''Mountain Woman'' -an early work that she had always disliked - in her 1967 retrospective at the Whitney Museum. As the curator kept insisting on it, ''she was more and more unhappy,'' he said.         Shortly before the show opened, Mrs. Nevelson requested that Mr. Glimcher help her ''rearrange'' it. ''She asked us to carry 'Mountain Woman' across the room, and at midpoint she said, ''Drop it,'' Mr. Glimcher recalled. ''We did, and the work was 'rearranged' to her satisfaction, in a thousand pieces.'' A Telegram at Yaddo         Hilton Kramer, editor of The New Criterion, a magazine of the arts, told of writing one of the earliest reviews of Mrs. Nevelson's work in the mid-1950's. It was the first in her long series of sculptural environments known as ''walls.'' He said that later, at Yaddo, the writers' retreat in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., he was summoned to the telephone by Western Union with a telegram from Mrs. Nevelson. ''The telegram read, 'I love you,' '' Mr. Kramer recalled.         Despite her later success, he went on to say, Mrs. Nevelson ''remained extraordinarily independent of her reputation and other people's reputations.'' And he cited her belief that ''you can be anything you want to be'' as ''the key to her artistic ambitions, her esthetic audacity and the personal freedom she achieved as woman as well as artist.''         Barbaralee Diamonstein, a member of the New York City Landmarks Commission, a writer on art and architecture and a longtime friend of Mrs. Nevelson, described the sculptor -known for her theatrical garb and personality almost as much as for her art - as ''all collage:her work, her conversation, her ensembles.''         ''A complex cross between a princess and a peasant, an egalitarian with some surprisingly elitist concerns,'' she said, ''Louise was a living assemblage who accurately mirrored her startling and stunning constructions.'' 'I Always Knew I Was Great'         Speaking also of Mrs. Nevelson's belief in herself as a vital factor in her work, Miss Diamonstein recalled once asking her how she had survived during her many years of obscurity before success. ''I always knew I was great,'' Mrs. Nevelson replied. The short program was ended by the playwright Edward Albee, who said Mrs. Nevelson had understood ''perhaps better than any artist I've known, that she was her art.'' And he told of interviewing the sculptor with a tape recorder for an article he was writing. ''She said she didn't mind,'' he said. ''I tested it out and it worked well. Then, when I actually put it on the table, she said 'What's that?' She passed her hand over it a few times. I asked the important questions. When I got home, my tape recorder was blank. It was simply that Louise was a wizard and those of us who knew her, knew her work, we knew she was a wizard, did we not?''

        Peggy Parish, the author of more than 30 children's books that have sold more than 7 million copies, died of a ruptured abdominal aneurysm on Friday at Clarendon Memorial Hospital in Manning, S.C. She was 61 years old.         Peggy Parish, the author of more than 30 children's books that have sold more than 7 million copies, died of a ruptured abdominal aneurysm on Friday at Clarendon Memorial Hospital in Manning, S.C. She was 61 years old.         Miss Parish's best-known character is Amelia Bedelia, a literal-minded maid who cuts a mistake-prone swath through 11 books (which are illustrated by various artists). When told to help the children plant bulbs, she buys light bulbs. When told to weed the garden, she plants row upon row of big weeds. When her employers, Mr. and Mr. Rogers, ask her to stuff stockings for the neighbors' children, she wonders why they want stockings full of turkey stuffing, but she dutifully obeys. When she is asked to make a spongecake, she snips a sponge into small pieces and drops it into a cake. A Birthday Celebration         Amelia Bedelia has many redeeming qualities, of course, not the least of which is her naivete, and she is loved by her fictional employers. She is also loved by real schoolchildren, many of whom joined in a celebration this year of Amelia Bedelia's 25th birthday, sponsored jointly by Greenwillow Books, Harper & Row and Avon Books, her principal publishers.         Paulette C. Kaufmann, director of children's book marketing at William Morrow & Company, the publisher of Greenwillow, said that hundreds of bookstores and libraries were given mailboxes in which children were invited to submit birthday wishes. ''Since August,'' she said, ''the contents of those mailboxes have been arriving daily - thousands of letters and drawings from children who have read and loved books about Amelia Bedelia.'' From Teacher to Writer         Miss Parish was born in Manning, and graduated from the University of South Carolina with a degree in English. She taught school in Oklahoma, Kentucky and, for more than 15 years, at the Dalton School in Manhattan. It was while teaching third grade at the Dalton School that she published her first book, in 1961. Her first Amelia Bedelia book was published two years later.         Her other books include ''The Cats' Burglar,'' ''Dinosaur Time,'' ''The Ghosts of Cougar Island,'' ''Good Hunting Little Indian,'' ''Hermit Dan'' and ''Let's Be Early Settlers With Daniel Boone.''         Miss Parish had a lifelong interest in teaching children to read and study, and she was proud that her books were often used in schools. She returned to Manning in 1972, continuing to write and to speak to library associations and children's education groups.         She is survived by her brother, Stanley, of Manning. A funeral service is to be held today at 2 P.M. at the Presbyterian Church in Manning.

        Alice Boney, a prominent dealer in Oriental art, died of cardiac arrest Wednesday at her Manhattan apartment. She was 87 years old.         Alice Boney, a prominent dealer in Oriental art, died of cardiac arrest Wednesday at her Manhattan apartment. She was 87 years old.         Miss Boney was self-taught, yet rose to become an adviser on Chinese and Japanese art to collectors and museums. ''The doyenne of Oriental art,'' a Hong Kong magazine, Orientations, called her in an article to appear later this month.         ''In the 65 years of her career, she did what few women in the world dared to do,'' the article said. ''She entered the male-dominated world of Oriental art and she prospered.''         Born in Philadelphia, Miss Boney inherited a trust fund from her grandfather. She moved to New York, where she met Ian Kleykamp, a Dutch art dealer. They married and opened a gallery on Fifth Avenue.         They brought a shipload of Chinese tomb sculptures from the Tang Dynasty (618 to 906 A.D.) to New York and mounted an exhibition of the art. In 1926, they exhibited contemporary Japanese paintings, then rarely seen in the United States. Helped Build Hoover's Collection         During the Depression, the gallery closed and Miss Boney divorced. She went into business for herself, selling art to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and the Freer Gallery in Washington.         Miss Boney was instrumental in building President Herbert H. Hoover's porcelain collection of Ming Dynasty (1368 to 1644 A.D.) and Manchu Dynasty (1644 to 1912 A.D.) objects.         During the 1940's and 1950's, she helped to organize exhibitions of art and furniture at the China Institute and elsewhere. ''She introduced leading Japanese artists and potters to America,'' said Amy Poster, the acting director of the Asian art department at the Brooklyn Museum. In 1958 Miss Boney went to Japan for six months and stayed for 16 years, returning annually to the United States to sell art.         ''She was the preeminent dealer in her field of Asian art and particularly Japanese art,'' Ms. Poster noted. ''She taught a younger generation of dealers, collectors and museum professionals a great deal about an esthetic that she understood very well.''         When Miss Boney returned to New York in 1974, she worked from her Park Avenue apartment. She greeted visitors dressed in a green silk robe and matching antique jade jewelry. The robe, a Japanese yukata, which is less formal than a kimono, was given to her by a sumo wrestler.         There are no survivors.
