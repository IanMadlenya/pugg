         Jane Clapperton Cushman, a writer and literary agent, died on Dec. 30 at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 68 and lived in Greenwich Village.         The cause was cancer, said her son, Thomas Cushman of Manhattan.         Her company, the JCA Literary Agency, was founded by her husband, John A. S. Cushman, in 1976; he died in 1984.         Mrs. Cushman was known for representing and encouraging young first novelists. Her agency also represented authors like Richard Rhodes, who won a Pulitzer Prize in 1988 as well as a 1987 National Book Award for ''The Making of the Atomic Bomb,'' and David Garrow, whose ''Bearing the Cross'' won a Pulitzer in 1987.         Mrs. Cushman was born in Oxford, England. She graduated from Somerville College at Oxford in 1952 and came to the United States in 1960. She reviewed books for Cosmopolitan magazine, was an editor at Crown and other publishing houses and wrote for magazines in the United States and Britain.         Besides her son, she is survived by a sister, Amanda Clapperton-Blake  of London.       
         Clare Potter, a leading American fashion designer of the 1930's and 40's known for imaginative use of color and simplicity of line, died Jan. 5 at her home in Fort Ann, N.Y. She was 95.         Along with Claire McCardell and Tina Leser, Ms. Potter was one of the designers credited with inventing American sportswear, a style that has influenced designers all over the world. She was a featured designer at Lord & Taylor when the store was headed by the legendary Dorothy Shaver, and received the first Lord & Taylor Design Award in 1938 for ''distinguished designing in the field of sports clothes for women.'' She also received a Neiman Marcus Award in 1939 and a Coty Fashion Critics Award in 1946. In 1939, she designed a blue wool dress for Eleanor Roosevelt to wear to meet King George VI and Queen Elizabeth of England.         Several of Ms. Potter's designs are  in an exhibition called, ''Designing Women: American Style 1940-1960,'' at the Wadsworth Atheneum in Hartford.         ''She was incredibly important,'' said Richard Martin, the curator of the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art. ''She was one of that first group in the 1930's of designers recognized by name. She was recognized by American women for getting rid of ornamentation. She wasn't the boldest, like Claire McCardell, but she was known for color and simple textures, for a discreet style of dressing, for sophisticated sportswear.''         An aristocratic-looking woman who loved sports, particularly horseback riding, Ms. Potter designed for women like herself who favored casual clothes that were simple yet sophisticated. ''Large numbers of American women want clothes that are refined,'' Ms. Potter said in a 1948 interview with The New York Times. ''I aim to give them in a medium-priced, ready-to-wear costume what they would find in custom-made styles.''         Among the styles she was known for were the two-piece swimsuit consisting of a bra and bloomers, the evening sweater and the sidesaddle-draped skirt. Even for evening, her designs tended to be as casual as a shirt and skirt or pants and a tunic. One outfit of the 1940's combined a rose-colored blouse, a pale blue floor-length skirt and a green belt.         ''She did forward-looking active sports clothes, sundresses, trousers, bathing suits and evening sweaters,'' said Valerie Steele, the chief curator of the Museum at the Fashion Institute of Technology. ''She wasn't influenced by Paris, but by the modern American leisure life style.''         Ms. Potter was born in Jersey City in 1903. Her affinity for color could be traced to an interest in art she developed while in high school, where she was art editor of the school paper, and continued with studies at the Art Students League. Although she did not know how to sew, she took a draping course and produced what she later described as ''my first weird costume,'' consisting of a long, slinky red wool dress with huge silk sleeves that she dyed to match.         She went on to study at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn and after graduation found a job with a dress manufacturer. In 1948 she went into partnership with Martha Stout, a former magazine editor, in a ready-to-wear company called Timbertop. The name came from the turkey farm in West Nyack, N.Y., where Ms. Potter lived with her husband, J. Sanford Potter, an architect.         By the mid-1950's she was in business on her own, working from a barn on her farm with her husband drafting the patterns for her clothing. ''It was very chic to go out there and buy things in a lovely spot,'' recalled Virginia Wagoner Booth, who was then a buyer for Lord & Taylor and became a lifelong friend.         In the late 1950's, Mr. Potter designed and built a Japanese-style house in Fort Ann on Lake Nebo, where the couple grew camellias and raised Dalmatians.         ''They kept horses down in Virginia,'' Ms. Booth said, ''and went down every weekend in the fall to hunt. Clare remained physically active almost until the end. When she took to her bedroom, she could look out at the lake and see the birds. She loved to watch and feed the birds.         ''When Sandy died four years ago,'' she added, referring to Mr. Potter, ''we scattered his ashes on the property. We'll do the same thing with hers.''         Ms. Potter left no survivors.       
         Dr. Judith Silberpfennig Kestenberg, a psychoanalyst specializing in child development and the emotional state of Holocaust survivors and their children, died Saturday at her home in Sands Point, N.Y. She was 88.         Dr. Kestenberg headed Child Development Research, which she founded 30 years ago, and Holocaust Child Survivor Studies, both based in Sands Point. With her husband, Milton, she started the research center's International Study of the Organized Persecution of Children.         She and her associates traveled all over the world to collect taped interviews with more than 1,500 child survivors of the Holocaust and their children, as well as the children of Nazis. Fluent in French, German and Polish, she wrote two German books used to teach German children about the Holocaust.         Judith Silberpfennig was born in Tarnov, Poland, and trained in medicine, neurology and psychiatry in Vienna. She came to New York in 1937 and completed her training at Bellevue Hospital and the New York Psychological Institute.         Her husband was born in Lodz, Poland, and became a lawyer there before coming to the United States in 1939. He managed real estate in New York and, after World War II, sued in German courts to seek compensation for Holocaust victims and also organized aid for their children.         They were married in the mid-1940's and became a team in their Holocaust pursuits when he started representing the victims, especially children, before the courts and found that many of them had only vague memories of their ordeals.         Dr. Kestenberg, a professor emeritus at New York University Medical School, taught generations of psychiatrists, psychologists, psychoanalysts and other experts on development, mental health and dance-movement therapy. She also was on the staff and faculty at Long Island Jewish Hospital.         She published seven books and some 150 professional articles. Most recently she edited, with Dr. Charlotte Kahn, ''Children Surviving Persecution: An International Study of Trauma and Healing'' (Greenwood, 1998).         Her other books in print include ''Sexuality, Body Movement and the Rhythms of Development'' (Aronson, 1995); with Dr. Ira Brenner, ''The Last Witness: The Child Survivor of the Holocaust'' (American Psychiatric Press, 1996), and, as editor with Dr. Eva Fogelman, ''Children During the Nazi Reign: Psychological Perspective on the Interview Process'' (Greenwood, 1994).         Milton Kestenberg died in 1991. Dr. Kestenberg is survived by a son, Howard, of Foxborough, Mass.; a daughter, Janet Kestenberg of West Chester, Pa., and four grandchildren.         Her work at Child Development Research is being continued by Dr. Fogelman and associates.       
         Dr. Jan Hawkins, a pioneer in the use of computers and other technology in education, died Feb. 9 at New York Presbyterian Hospital. She was 47 and lived in Cambridge, Mass., and on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.         The cause was breast cancer, her family said.         Before joining the education faculty at Harvard University in September, Dr. Hawkins established her reputation through her work as director of the Center for Children and Technology, an agency founded in 1981 by the Bank Street College of Education in New York. Dr. Hawkins joined the group that year, long before computers had become an integral part of education.         ''She worked to find the mutual fit needed so technology could work in an educational setting,'' said Dr. Howard Gardner, a colleague of Dr. Hawkins's at Harvard. Dr. Hawkins was often called upon for help and advice by school districts, museums and other educational institutions looking for ways to integrate computers into their programs.         In her first studies during the early 1980's, she showed that children, especially girls, used computers in sociable and collaborative ways, not in isolation as critics had feared, said Dr. Margaret Honey, a longtime colleague of Dr. Hawkins's at the center.         In 1994, the Center for Children and Technology became a division of the Education Development Center, based in Newton, Mass. Dr. Hawkins became a vice president of that association, which, like the Center for Children and Technology, is a nonprofit research and development group financed by grants and contracts with foundations and government institutions.         Jan Hawkins was born in New Canaan, Conn., and received her bachelor's degree in psychology and English from Tufts University in 1973. She received a master's degree in psychology and a doctorate in developmental psychology from the Graduate Center of the City University of New York in 1987.         She belonged to numerous boards and advisory groups in her field. She was an editor of professional journals and at Cambridge University Press, dealing with its ''Learning by Doing'' series.         Dr. Hawkins is survived by her parents, John and Francette Hawkins of Mountain View, Calif.; two sisters, Kim Hawkins of Cleveland and Cynthia Rahilly of Manhattan; a brother, John Hawkins of Virginia Beach, Va., and her fiance, Prof. Rand Spiro of East Lansing, Mich.       
         Dorothea Zack Hanle, a longtime editor at Bon Appetit, a cookbook writer and one of the founders of Les Dames d'Escoffier, an international women's organization that promotes fine dining and wine, died Tuesday at the home of her son, Alan, in North Brunswick, N.J. She was 83 and lived in Manhattan and Ship Bottom, N.J.         Ms. Hanle was born in Philadelphia and grew up in Ship Bottom, where her father, Richard A. Zachariae, was a real estate agent. Throughout her life, she was called Zack.         After attending Wilson College in Chambersburg, Pa., and Barnard College, she was hired by Mademoiselle, where she wrote on a wide range of subjects. Dell Publishing took note of her flair for dispensing useful advice and hired her as editor in chief of its special-projects division. At Dell, she wrote and edited more than 65 pocket-size how-to handbooks, and in 1964, under the name Dorothea Zack Hanle, wrote the book ''The Hairdo Handbook: A Complete Guide to Hair Beauty.''         In 1972, CBS Publications wooed her to edit a new publication, Epicure, but she remained at Dell, editing the first issue of Epicure under the pen name Carter Chase. She then left Dell and edited Epicure for two years under her own name, and later edited another CBS magazine, Everywoman's, which competed with Family Circle.         In 1976 she joined the staff of Bon Appetit, where she created several columns and features, including  ''The Bon Vivant,'' ''Entertaining With . . .'' and ''Profiles in Cooking.'' According to Tanya W. Steel, a senior editor for the magazine, her byline appeared more often than that of any other writer.         She was Bon Appetit's New York editor until 1990, when she was named an editor at large. From 1997 until her death she was a consultant to the magazine.         Her books include ''The Surfer's Handbook'' (1968), ''Cooking With Flowers'' (1971) and ''Cooking Wild Game'' (1974). With Martin Herz, she wrote a children's cookbook, ''The Golden Ladle'' (1945). She also wrote books on gardening, diet and exercise.         In 1990, Ms. Hanle was honored by the James Beard Foundation at its first annual Editor's Dinner.         She is survived by her son; a daughter, Jennifer Malahowski of Austin, Tex., and three grandchildren.       
         Judge Mary Johnson Lowe, a Federal judge in the Southern District of New York who was known for her rulings in discrimination cases, died  Saturday at a hospital in Las Vegas, Nev. She was 74 and had homes in the Bronx and Las Vegas.         The cause was heart failure, and she had been in declining health, a daughter, Leslie H. Lowe, said.         Judge Lowe was the second black woman appointed to the Federal judiciary, according to The Journal of Blacks in Higher Education. She was recommended by Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and appointed by President Carter in 1978. At the time, there were 400 Federal trial judges, 15 of whom were black and 5 of whom were female.         As a senior judge, a status she acquired in 1991, she sat on the bench here for part of the year, and had been doing some judicial work while in Las Vegas.         Earlier, she was a judge of the Criminal Court of the City of New York from 1971 until 1973, when she was named an Acting State Supreme Court Justice assigned to the Manhattan Supreme Court's Centralized Narcotics Term. She held that post, sitting in Manhattan, until 1974. She served on the Supreme Court in Bronx County in 1975 and 1976. In 1977 she was elected a justice of the State Supreme Court.         In 1984, in District Court in Manhattan, she issued a widely noted injunction barring New York City from ''refusing to allow homeless individuals to register to vote on the ground that they fail to inhabit traditional residences.'' She said the city's Board of Elections had defined the term ''residence'' to exclude ''an entire group of otherwise eligible voters,'' estimated at the time at 20,000.         In the ruling, she said that voter residency requirements could be satisfied by ''homeless individuals identifying a specific location within a political community which they consider their home base, to which they return regularly, manifest an intent to remain for the present, and from which they can receive messages and be contacted.''         In 1981 she ruled that a New York City pension system, which assumed that women lived three years longer than men, discriminated illegally against women by requiring them to make higher contributions even though they received lower monthly benefits when they retired.         One of the most controversial cases she handled was a 1988 racketeering trial in which the jury convicted eight men, including the reputed former head of the Genovese crime family. The conviction was overturned with unusually harsh language when the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found that Judge Lowe had prevented the presentation of important evidence. ''This was an error of constitutional magnitude,'' the appellate judges wrote.         She was a visiting lecturer at Harvard Law School. The honors she received included a New York State Bar Association award for her ''outstanding judicial contribution to the criminal justice system.''         Judge Lowe was born in Manhattan and grew up in Harlem. She received a bachelor's degree in 1952  from Hunter College, a law degree with honors in 1954 from Brooklyn Law School, where she was president of her class and the first black editor in chief of the law review, and a master's degree in 1955 from Columbia Law School.         Judge Lowe's marriages to Edward Hatfield Lowe and Ivan A. Michael ended in divorce. She is survived by two daughters, Bess Michael of Washington, and Leslie, of Manhattan; a son, Dr. Edward H. Lowe of Edison, N.J.; a granddaughter; two sisters, Eddie Johnson Carkhum of Teaneck, N.J., and Ann J. Bolton of Los Angeles, and four brothers, Harry Johnson and Dr. James J. Johnson, both of Teaneck, and Dr. John William Johnson and Robert Johnson, both of the Bronx.       
         DEBBIE BOYLAN is a dinosaur and proud of it, the owner of an independent bookstore in Westchester County who is not persuaded that she wants to go head-to-head with Barnes & Noble and Amazon.com.         Her customers at Good Yarns in Hastings-on-Hudson are more than happy to bring their own coffee, a plain cuppa joe for 60 cents from the bagel place next door, rather than take out a loan for a double latte at the nearest superstore.         And they'd prefer to drop in for an hour of good conversation rather than order a book with the click of a mouse. Internet shopping may be  efficient, but it's not a way of finding out whose daffodils have popped and whose children have gotten into college.         Good Yarns, by all accounts, is a dying breed, a hole-in-the-wall in an era of megamalls, a brick-and-mortar business in the age of on-line commerce. It is one of 3,300 independent book stores, according to the American Booksellers Association, down from 5,200 in 1992.         In response to the threat of extinction, the trade group has hired a marketing heavyweight, begun a national advertising campaign to encourage people to shop small and created its own on-line store, scheduled to open this summer.         Ms. Boylan and her co-owner, Rowie Edelman, plan to read the prospectus on the joint venture, which Michael F. Hoynes, the association's new marketing director, says is ''like True Value Hardware,'' a way for the little guys to ''come together but keep their identity.'' But the owners of Good Yarns are skeptical.         ''I don't see us expanding on the Internet,'' Ms. Boylan said. ''We have a finite and loyal customer base. They want to touch books, look at books, talk about books.''         Good Yarns was abuzz with gardening chatter earlier this week, when 60 degree temperatures had snow dripping from eaves all over town, the current rushing in the Saw Mill River and doors open along Main Street. A landscape architect from Irvington came in for Faulkner's ''As I Lay Dying.'' She stayed to commiserate with Ginny Auld, a saleswoman, who was mourning a dead butterfly weed, whose orange blooms had brightened her yard for 19 years.         A former Hastings resident who now lives across the river in Nyack stopped in after her weekly Jewish history class at the temple. She left with ''A Boy's Life,'' by Tobias Wolfe and ''The Story of Little Babaji,'' a version of ''Little Black Sambo'' that restores much of the original 1899 text. But not before a lengthy discourse on roses.         THE hot book on this balmy day was a well-reviewed first novel, ''Amy and Isabelle,'' by Elizabeth Strout. Ms. Boylan had ordered two copies for regular customers from the nearby river towns who were willing to wait a few days rather than shop in one of several Barnes & Nobles on Central Avenue, the dreary commercial spine of the county. Both costumers rushed in as soon as they got the telephone call. ''I have it on order, too,'' Ms. Boylan said. Disappointment crossed her face. She could not ''borrow'' a copy for the early morning hours when she does most of her reading.         Ms. Boylan grew up just blocks from the store, graduated from Hastings High School and Mercy College in neighboring Dobbs Ferry. She went to school with half the merchants in the village, and her 53-year-old sister, Donna, with the other half. The women own a two-family house and share responsibility for their elderly father, who is blind. Reading time is scarce with the demands of an aging parent and a seven-day-a-week business. Ms. Boylan pines for the expansive days of childhood, when she would read ''Black Beauty'' over and over. At 12, she discovered ''Franny and Zooey,'' was ''knocked of my feet'' and ''never read another kids' book again.''         Now, binge reading is possible only  on vacation. During a recent week in Florida, she raced through three novels and found herself bookless at the airport. It was one of the few times in her life, Ms. Boylan said, that she has bought a book someplace other than at Good Yarns.         The store was once a needlepoint shop. But times changed, wives and mothers went to work, and the wool and crochet hooks gave way to novels and biographies. Ms. Boylan was a customer back then, buying books -- mainly 20th century American fiction -- to read on the train to Manhattan, where she worked as an editor. Later, with her sister, she owned a graphic design business. With the advent of desktop publishing, her business became obsolete and Ms. Boylan took part-time work at Good Yarns while she looked for something to do. That turned out to be buying a share of the store when Ms. Edelman's partner retired.         The two women seem quaintly oblivious to issues like foot traffic. ''I'm trying to envision a busy day, '' Ms. Boylan said. ''Fifty customers? A hundred? I'm guessing. But a good day is anything over $1,000.''         And what sells well in a village of 8,000 that supports four bookstores (one second-hand, one for foreign language books and one for first editions)? Hardcover nonfiction. Paperback fiction. Local authors. Whatever Ms. Boylan recommends -- lately Alice McDermott's ''Charming Billy'' or Don DeLillo's ''Underworld.''         ''Low-end political scandal and movie star books don't go here,'' she said. ''We've only sold two Monicas. If we sold three I'd be surprised.''         PUBLIC LIVES       
         Lila Hotz Luce Tyng, the first wife of Henry R. Luce, founder of Time Inc., died on Wednesday at her home in Gladstone, N.J., five days after her 100th birthday.         Mrs. Tyng, the mother of Mr. Luce's children, was a leading figure in New York's social and philanthropic circles for several decades.         Though overshadowed in history by the editor's famous second wife, the author Clare Boothe Luce, Mrs. Tyng played an important role in the life of Mr. Luce, who sought her advice even after they were divorced, said Robert E. Herzstein, a professor of history at the University of South Carolina and the author of ''Henry R. Luce'' (Scribner, 1994).         Lila Hotz was born in Chicago in 1899, the daughter of Robert Schuttler Hotz, an inventor and financier, and Lila Ross Hotz. On New Year's Eve 1919, she met the young Luce through one of his Yale classmates, Thornton Wilder; they were married in 1923.         The young wife hoped that Time's growing success would eventually allow her workaholic husband to join her in the kind of social whirl she loved. But they divorced in 1935, not long after Mr. Luce met Clare Boothe, whose literary and journalistic drives and interests better matched his own. ''Lila was devastated when Luce confronted her with his intention to divorce her,'' Dr. Herzstein said. ''But they maintained a closeness and were in constant contact, often discussing their children's education and careers, among other things.''         Mrs. Tyng and Mr. Luce, who died in 1967, had two sons: Henry Luce 3d,  chairman and chief executive of the Henry Luce Foundation in New York City, and Peter Paul Luce of Englewood, Colo.         In 1939, she married Sewell Tappan Tyng, a lawyer, author, head of a mining company and assistant to the New York City District Attorney, Thomas E. Dewey. She became a fixture in New York society, serving on the boards of several institutions,  including the Henry Street Settlement, the Berkshire Farm School, the Spence-Chapin Adoption Service  and the Grosvenor Neighborhood House. She once reported attending 36 balls in 36 weeks.         Besides her two sons, Mrs. Tyng is survived by six grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.       
         Edith Anderson, an American writer who defied postwar ruin and harsh political realities to resettle in divided Berlin with her German Communist husband and lived just long enough to see her cold war memoir published and praised as a literary event, died on Tuesday at her home in Berlin. She was 83.         Ms. Anderson, whose last name was originally Handelsman, had returned to Berlin on April 7 after two weeks in New York to promote her new book, ''Love in Exile,'' published in March by Steerforth Press of South Royalton, Vt.         The product of decades of reminiscences, journalism and correspondence, the book traces Ms. Anderson's odyssey from a conservative Jewish upbringing in the Bronx, to a stint at the Communist newspaper Daily Worker, to encounters with Richard Wright, Simone de Beauvoir, Anna Seghers, Stefan Heym and other literati. She also wrote of her consuming romance with Max Schroeder, a surrealist poet, editor and antifascist whom she married and followed from his wartime exile in New York back to Soviet-controlled East Germany in 1947.         ''Love in Exile'' has been hailed by Grace Paley, Doris Lessing and Vivian Gornick, among other writers, as a sharp and gripping portrait of an ideological and human landscape as foreign to today's Americans as the dark side of the moon. A review in The New York Times Book Review  found the book most affecting when Ms. Anderson recounted her domestic anguish and search for love outside the marriage.         In an early section, she described how she landed her job at The Daily Worker in 1942, when she was 26.         ''Hastening down Broadway to my Marxist analyst who charged only $5 a session because I was unemployed (he too was still young) I bumped into a former college crony named Milton. He hailed me joyously. 'You're just the person I need!' He told me he was cultural editor of The Daily Worker but had just been drafted into the Army and must find a replacement by the weekend.''         She was overwhelmed. She would scrub floors at The Daily Worker. But she had no newspaper experience. She wrote:         '' 'I'll break you in,' he said.         '' 'In three days?         '' 'Less.' ''         She asked herself how she had the nerve to pass herself off as cultural editor. ''My analyst brushed these scruples aside. He was delighted that I had a real challenge to bite into; life, as Marx said, was a struggle and I was no more a fraud than anyone else.''         Still, she was soon dismissed and ended up as one of the women on train crews hired to replace men called to war. Shortly afterward, she met Mr. Schroeder, a craggy and mesmerizing onetime bohemian 17 years her senior. He had escaped from Nazi captivity in Vichy, France, and was editing an anti-fascist publication in New York.         After he returned to Germany in 1946, she followed the next year, via Paris, after almost joining the American Army in a desperate effort to enter restricted Berlin at a time when almost everyone there would have given anything to get out. She was to remain, with only intermittent visits home, for the next 52 years, although her husband died in 1958. They had a daughter, Cordelia, who still lives in Berlin.         In ''Love in Exile,'' Ms. Anderson said that as a widow she considered returning to the United States with her daughter but was deterred by the imagined voice of Max: ''What right have you to deprive her of the Socialism for which so many people died or went into exile? It may be imperfect but something can be made of it.'' The book ends in 1962.         Although clearly enamored of Marxism since youth, Ms. Anderson was not overtly political, said her childhood friend, the writer Helen Yglesias, a classmate at James Monroe High School in the Bronx. ''She was highly sympathetic to Max's idealism and his hope that a just society could be built,'' she said.         But she was a sharp and often corrosive chronicler of the death throes of the German Democratic Republic as Communism collapsed and the Berlin Wall fell in 1989: ''a kaleidoscope rolling downhill,'' as she described it.         In an account of the final days, later included in an anthology, ''Without Force or Lies'' (1990), she wrote of traveling through East Germany in a train compartment with her grandson and watching a young man and woman, strangers, suddenly shed their inhibitions and take up the taboo subject of politics.         The man, agitated, ripped off his tie, warning that East Germans  ''had just about had it,'' she wrote.         '' 'I give it one more year before something busts,' he said.         '' 'Six months,' she replied.''         Her grandson grew alarmed and Ms. Anderson sought to calm him. ''But I felt my own scalp creep, as if some law of nature had had broken, a sheep instead of baaing shouted in a human voice, 'Enough!'         ''The young woman had hit it right on the nose: six months. The unthinkable happened here.''         At the same time, Ms. Anderson also wrote acidly of the former West Germans ''tramping around'' the prostrate east, flooding it with inferior ''Western goods.''         Edith Handelsman grew up on Hoe Avenue in the Bronx and graduated in 1937 from New College, a division of Teachers College at Columbia University. In addition to her daughter, she is survived by a brother, John Bernard Handelsman of Hampton Bays, N.Y., a cartoonist at The New Yorker, and a grandson.         Besides her memoir, Ms. Anderson also wrote ''Gelbes Licht'' (''Yellow Light'') in 1956 about her railroad work, and short stories, children's books and radio plays. A play, ''Wo Ist Katalin? (''Where Is Katalin?''), was produced in Weimar in 1977. From 1960 to 1977 she was the Berlin correspondent for The New York National Guardian.         Mr. Handelsman said that on her recent book-promotion visit to New York, his sister seemed confused and forgetful, possibly presaging her fatal stroke.         But Ms. Anderson's literary agent, Malaga Baldi of Manhattan, said any infirmities disappeared at a reading the author gave at the New School for Social Research on March 25.         ''She started to read an excerpt,'' Ms. Baldi said, ''but the people would not let her stop.''       
         Grace Zia Chu, who introduced a generation of Americans to Chinese cuisine though her cooking classes in Manhattan and her landmark book ''The Pleasures of Chinese Cooking,'' died Thursday at a nursing home in Columbus, Ohio. She was 99.         In an era when most Americans believed that chop suey was a classic Chinese dish, Mrs. Chu led her students and readers, step by step, down the complicated byways of Chinese cooking, which, she explained, differed from region to region and, ideally, relied on raw ingredients that did not come from a can. For home cooks bewildered by the unfamiliar ingredients and techniques involved, Mrs. Chu proved to be an ideal guide. Assuming, correctly, that her readers knew precisely nothing about Chinese cuisine, she wrote clearly and simply, tailoring her recipes to the realities of the American kitchen, even if that meant calling for creamed corn in the recipe for chicken velvet corn soup.         Mrs. Chu was born in Shanghai. She was the eldest of the nine children of Zia Hong-lai, a Christian educator and editor, and Sochen Sze. After graduating from the McTyeire School for Girls in Shanghai in 1918, she won a scholarship to Wellesley College in Wellesley, Mass., where she earned a degree in physical education in 1924. After returning to China, she taught at McTyeire and taught physical education at Ginling College in Nanjing, and from 1935 to 1947, she was a vice president of the world Young Women's Christian Association.         In 1928, she married Chu Shih-ming, an army officer and an official in the Nationalist Government who at one time was an interpreter and aide-de-camp to Chiang Kai-shek.  When he was posted as a military attache to the Chinese Embassy in Washington in 1941, Mrs. Chu took on the entertaining duties that transformed her into an ambassador for Chinese food.         Mrs. Chu returned to China after World War II but left in 1950 and took up permanent residence in the United States, becoming a citizen in 1955. By that time she had settled in Manhattan, where she began teaching cooking classes at the China Institute. For the next 30 years, she taught at the institute, the Mandarin House restaurant on West 13th Street and at her apartment on West 111th Street.         Her classes later resulted in two cookbooks, ''The Pleasures of Chinese Cooking'' (1962) and ''Madame Chu's Chinese Cooking School'' (1975).         In ''The Pleasures of Chinese Cooking,'' Mrs. Chu patiently guided her readers through unfamiliar territory. She listed and described the basic ingredients of Chinese dishes, and the utensils and techniques used to prepare them. She showed how to use a Chinese cleaver, how to hold chopsticks, how to grow bean sprouts at home and how to order a proper Chinese meal in a restaurant. In a concession to American tastes, Mrs. Chu included recipes for chop suey, chow mein and other Chinese-American hybrids, but then pressed on to offer more authentic fare like string beans in bean curd sauce and lobster with black bean sauce, as well as challenging banquet dishes like shark fins with Chinese cabbage.         ''The book may well be the finest, most lucid volume on Chinese cooking ever written,'' Craig Claiborne wrote in The New York Times in 1962. To a generation of Americans familiar with the distinctions among Sichuan, Hunan and Cantonese cooking styles, ''The Pleasures of Chinese Cooking'' reads like a period piece, but in the early 1960's it was a badly needed instruction manual. It is telling that in his review of the book, Mr. Claiborne had to explain to readers that a wok was ''a Chinese cooking utensil.''         With Arthur Chu, Mrs. Chu wrote ''Oriental Antiques and Collectibles: a Guide'' (1973), ''Oriental Cloisonne and Other Enamels'' and ''The Collector's Book of Jade'' (1978).         Her husband died in 1965, and Mrs. Chu moved to Columbus in 1986. She is survived by her sister, Ruth Zia, of Columbus; two sons, Samuel, of Columbus and Daniel, of New York City; three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.         MRS.

         Elizabeth Tilberis, the editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar, who transformed it from a tired magazine into a viable voice in fashion while she battled ovarian cancer and raised awareness of the disease, died yesterday morning at Mount Sinai Medical Center. She was 51 and had homes in Manhattan and East Hampton, N.Y.         Ms. Tilberis was highly respected for her ability as an editor, her warmth and her good humor in the face of debilitating treatments to halt the spread of the cancer that ultimately took her life. While hospitalized in December 1993 and again in the summer of 1995, she oversaw each issue of the monthly magazine, which she had taken over in February 1992. Until just a few days before her death, she was working on the June issue.         When Hearst Magazines, which publishes the 132-year-old Harper's Bazaar, hired Ms. Tilberis away from her job as editor in chief of British Vogue, it created a sensation in fashion magazine circles. She became the third reigning British editor of an important New York magazine, following Anna Wintour, editor in chief of Vogue, and Tina Brown, who was then the editor in chief of Vanity Fair and later became the editor of The New Yorker and is now developing Talk magazine.         The fashion world was abuzz with gossip on two topics: speculation that Hearst was paying Ms. Tilberis an annual salary of $1.25 million (never confirmed or denied) and anticipation of a rivalry between Ms. Tilberis and Ms. Wintour, her predecessor at British Vogue, who had recommended Ms. Tilberis as her replacement there. (No outward signs of either hostility or warmth were seen in the years they competed in New York.)         Ms. Tilberis's aim when she took over Harper's Bazaar, she said, was to make it ''the most beautiful fashion magazine in the world.'' She hired talented stylists and famous photographers and brought in Fabien Baron to redesign the look of the magazine. Under his art direction, it developed a strong graphics style,  which was widely copied.         The first issue under Ms. Tilberis's direction, September 1992, had a stunning cover shot by Patrick Demarchelier of the model Linda Evangelista in a stark black dress against a white background with no other headline on the cover than ''Enter the Era of Elegance.'' It was a startling contrast to the usual fashion magazine cover with multiple headlines in different colors. Subsequent issues added text lines and color and eventually looked more like other fashion publications. An exception was this year's February cover of Madonna, also photographed by Mr. Demarchelier, in striking black and red.         Industry reaction to the first change in the magazine was mixed. Some saw it as coolly elegant. Others thought it boring and lifeless. But it won awards, including two National Magazine Awards in 1993.         In 1994, Ms. Tilberis was named editor of the year by Advertising Age and received an award from the Council of Fashion Designers of America, which was presented to her by Diana, the Princess of Wales. The two women became friends in London, where the Princess of Wales often dropped by the offices of British Vogue and also appeared on its cover twice while Ms. Tilberis was editor. The Princess was also twice on the cover of Harper's Bazaar under Ms. Tilberis's editorship, once during her lifetime and once posthumously.         The September 1994 issue of Harper's Bazaar contained an informative article by Aimee Lee Ball, ''Ovarian Cancer: One Woman's Fight,'' in which Ms. Tilberis linked her use of fertility drugs in the late 1970's to the ovarian cancer that was diagnosed in December 1993. The fertility treatments were unsuccessful. The article described the disease and its treatment, which included nine weeks of chemotherapy, which caused Ms. Tilberis to lose 30 pounds.         In another article in the magazine, in May 1996, Ms. Tilberis described in diary form a bone-marrow transplant she underwent the previous summer to eradicate vestiges of the cancer. In both articles, she chose to find something positive to say about her illness: she had gone from a size 14 to a fashionable size 6 and was pleased that her silver hair was as flattering in its new short length as it had been as a chin-length bob.         She also discussed her battle with the disease in ''No Time to Die,'' a memoir written with Ms. Ball and published last year by Little, Brown. In 1997, Ms. Tilberis became president of the Ovarian Cancer Research Fund.         Elizabeth Kelly Tilberis was born Sept. 7, 1947 in Alderley Edge, a village outside of Manchester, England, to Jane and Thomas Stuart-Black Kelly. Her father was an eye surgeon, who was a pioneer in laser retinal detachment surgery and in developing soft contact lenses in the 1960's.         She received a Bachelor of Arts degree in fashion design from Leicester Polytechnic, a British school comparable to New York's Fashion Institute of Technology. It was there that she met her future husband, Andrew Tilberis, an artist, who was her tutor. She and her husband later adopted two children, Robert, now 17, and Christopher, 14.         In addition to her husband and sons, she is survived by her relatives in England: her mother, of Bath; her sister, Lois Stuart-Black of London, and her brother, Dr. Grant Kelly of West Sussex. Following her graduation in 1970, Ms. Tilberis went to British Vogue as a fashion assistant and worked her way to the top, becoming editor in chief in 1987.         Ms. Tilberis was active on the New York charity social scene, serving as chairwoman of benefits for causes like pediatric AIDS, the New York City Ballet and the Costume Institute of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.         She was scheduled to receive a Humanitarian Award in June from the Council of Fashion Designers of America, which will now be given posthumously, said Fern Mallis, the council's executive director. ''We are pleased that the award was announced earlier and not something added after her death,'' Ms. Mallis said yesterday.         Despite Ms. Tilberis's personal popularity and the publicity her tenure brought to the magazine, Harper's Bazaar never ousted Vogue from its pinnacle as the fashion publication with the largest circulation and the most advertising pages. As time went by under her editorship, the magazine lost some of its specialness and began to look more like other fashion publications. It also lost some high-profile editors and photographers to other magazines.         Unfazed, Ms. Tilberis pronounced herself pleased with the magazine in an interview in 1995. ''I think we made the niche we wanted to make, and I think we are the elegant fashion magazine I wanted to create,'' she said.         In an interview published last year in The Times, Ms. Tilberis discussed the stark contrast between her glamorous job and her illness: ''You can live in the fashion world and go to fashion shows and have your picture taken, et cetera, et cetera. But there's an important balance with what really goes on in life, which is sickness and suffering and people dying. Prior to having cancer, I didn't realize there was this whole different world. It's a great wake-up call.''       
         Darlene Geis, an author and editor, died on March 25 in a fire at her home in Manhattan. She was 81.         Ms. Geis wrote a number of popular books for young readers. ''The Little Train That Won a Medal'' was published in 1947 and has sold more than three million copies. She was also the author of ''Design for Ann'' (1949), ''The Mystery of the Thirteenth Floor'' (1953) and ''Dinosaurs and Other Prehistoric Animals'' (1959). She collaborated with Dione Lucas on ''The Gourmet Cooking School Cookbook'' (1964) and edited ''A Treasury of Great Recipes'' (1965) by Mary and Vincent Price.         Ms. Geis joined Harry N. Abrams, the art book publishers, in 1969 and eventually became senior editor for special projects. In that capacity she wrote and edited several books for Disney Enterprises, including ''Treasury of Children's Classics,'' ''The Fantasia Book'' and ''Treasury of Stories from Silly Symphonies.'' She also was instrumental in the creation of the ''The Joys of Wine'' (1977), working with Clifton Fadiman and Sam Aaron. Her other projects for Abrams included ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Operas'' and ''Encyclopedia of Quilts.''         She is survived by her husband, the publisher Bernard Geis; two sons, Peter, of La Honda, Calif., and Stephen, of Geneva; a sister, Jean S. Gottlieb of Fort Myers Beach, Fla.; eight grandchildren, and one great-grandchild.       
         Mary Lutyens, a well-born English  biographer and novelist who was applauded by critics on both sides of the Atlantic, died on April 9 in London. She was 90 and lived in London and the English county of Dorset.         Miss Lutyens (pronounced LUTCH-ens) was a daughter of Sir Edwin Landseer Lutyens (1869-1944), the British architect who planned New Delhi and many of its Government buildings, including the Viceroy's palace. Her mother was Lady Emily Lutyens, daughter of the First Earl of Lytton, a poet and a Viceroy of India.         Not surprisingly, Mary Lutyens was worldly as well as literary. In London, The Independent noted,  ''She was famous for her dry martinis and her elegance and, although unmusical, danced alone to Cole Porter for exercise.'' As a writer, she won praise for the accuracy and readability of her biographies, which included ''Millais and the Ruskins'' (1968). Sir John Everett Millais (1829-96) was a handsome British painter and a founder of the Pre-Raphaelite movement in Britain. John Ruskin (1819-1900) was a British social theorist and critic whose wife, Effie, fell in love with Millais.         Writing in The New York Times Book Review, Carolyn G. Heilbrun noted: ''Mary Lutyens has now restored to England the Davis Cup for the editing of Victorian letters -- a trophy long in American hands. In 'Millais and the Ruskins,' combining exemplary scholarship with editing that is at once tactful and informative, she uses many previously unpublished letters by eminent Victorians to tell a passionate and moving story. Her book will be equally valuable to the Victorian scholar and to what used to be called the general reader.''         Miss Lutyens was the editor of a related book-length collection of letters, ''Young Mrs. Ruskin in Venice,'' which was described in The Times Book Review by another critic, Joan Evans, as ''admirably and discreetly edited.''         Miss Lutyens also wrote several authoritative books about the Indian spiritual philosopher Jiddu Krishnamurt (1895-1986). They include ''Krishnamurti: The Open Door'' (1991).         Her more than a dozen works of fiction include ''Cleo'' (1974), which Martin Levin in The Times Book Review called a ''flawless tour de force.''         She also wrote fiction under the pseudonym Esther Wyndham.         Miss Lutyens was born in London and educated privately before attending Queens College, London. She  became a writer in her early 20's.         She married Anthony Sewell in 1930 and the couple were divorced in 1945. Later that year she married J. G. Links, an art expert known as Joe, who died in 1997.         She is survived by a daughter from her first marriage, Amanda.       
         Beverly Lewis, a vice president and senior editor at Bantam Books,  died on Monday in Manhattan. She was 51 and lived in Manhattan.         Ms. Lewis died on the way to a hospital after collapsing on a Manhattan street, her husband, Sandy Eames, said. The family is awaiting results of an autopsy.         Ms. Lewis had been named a vice president on May 18. As one of the firm's senior editors, she developed works by established novelists, including Jonathan Kellerman, Dean Koontz and Michael Palmer, and occasional celebrity authors like Patty Duke, Ali McGraw, Twyla Tharp and Gen. Norman H. Schwarzkopf. She had recently begun work on the much-anticipated autobiography of John Glenn, the former senator and astronaut, to be published this fall.         In a memo to his colleagues today, in which he had intended to announce Ms. Lewis's recent appointment, Irwyn Applebaum, the president and publisher of Bantam Books, said, ''She had the sharp eye to know when her writers could do better'' and, he added, ''she had the unwavering resolve and confidence to motivate and inspire her writers to reach down and indeed improve their work.''         A native of Arkansas, Ms. Lewis graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Sweetbriar College in Virginia. She worked as an editor at Pocket Books, Dell Publishing and Harcourt Brace before joining Bantam Books in 1986 as a consulting editor. She was promoted to senior editor in 1991.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a son, Alex, and a daughter, Elizabeth, both of Manhattan, and a brother, Clayton Lewis of Luxembourg.       
         Ruth Gilbert, a retired editor at New York magazine and The New York Herald Tribune, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 88 years old.         Ms. Gilbert was best known as the editor of her own page in New York magazine listing what she felt was stylish in the city at the moment.         She spent 24 years at New York magazine, retiring in 1992, and was an editor on the magazine when it was an insert in The Herald Tribune.         Ms. Gilbert is survived by a daughter, Gwynne Wolin of Stamford, Conn., and Coconut Creek, Fla., and two grandchildren.       
         Alice Adams, widely admired for her deft, elegantly observed novels and short stories, died yesterday at her home in San Francisco. She was 72.         She had been treated for heart problems earlier in the week and seemed to have died in her sleep, said her editor, Victoria Wilson.         In 10 novels and five collections of short stories, Ms. Adams created richly textured, artfully constructed novels about women's lives that sometimes mirrored and sometimes anticipated changes in the society as a whole. Admirers particularly praised her ability to capture place and voice and the deceptively artful craft of her writing.         Ms. Adams was born Aug. 14, 1926, in Fredericksburg, Va., grew up in Chapel Hill, N.C., was educated at Harvard, and spent most of her adult life in San Francisco, and her writing in many ways fused the seductive intimacy of the South, the intellectual sophistication of New England and the sense of adventure and openness to new experiences of the West.         ''She was just so deft and had such a wonderful touch,'' said Ms. Wilson, her editor for 25 years at Knopf, where she published all of her short-story collections and all but one of her novels. Another novel, ''After the War,'' has been completed and will be published next year. ''She was a master at condensing so much, with so much resonance, into a short form,'' Ms. Wilson added.         Alice Adams lived a life full of enough energy, contradiction and nuance that it would have made an apt subject for her own fiction. She was the only child of Agatha Erskine (Boyd) Adams and Nicholson Barney Adams. Her father was a Spanish professor at the University of North Carolina, her mother a frustrated writer full of unfulfilled literary aspirations. Ms. Adams described her family as ''three difficult, isolated people.''         She graduated from high school at 15, at which point, she once said, she ''ran into trouble because of that Southern thing that women are supposed to be stupid.''         She went to Radcliffe College, where she graduated at the age of 19 and soon married a fellow Harvard student, Mark Linenthal. The couple spent their first year together in Paris, where she soon realized the marriage was a mistake. ''I loved Paris,'' she said later, ''except I disliked him so much.''         The couple moved to San Francisco in 1948, where she found little time to pursue her writing. Eventually the couple divorced in 1958. Struggling to raise their only son, Peter, who survives her, she began writing seriously soon after while holding a variety of bookkeeping and clerical jobs. She published her first novel, ''Careless Love,'' to mixed reviews and after years of struggling to establish herself published her first short story for The New Yorker in 1969. She became one of the magazine's most distinctive fictional voices, eventually publishing more than 25 short stories there.         She soon established herself as a skillful, widely admired short-story writer and her second novel, ''Families and Survivors,'' the odyssey of a woman who moves from the South to San Francisco and from relationship to relationship, was published by Knopf in 1975. Reviewers either loved it or hated it, but it established her as a serious literary presence. That novel was followed by ''Listening to Billie'' in 1978 and the short-story collection ''Beautiful Girl'' in 1979. The Washington Post Book World compared the book to the work of F. Scott Fitzgerald ''in both style and subject matter.'' She had her greatest success with ''Superior Women'' in 1984, which became a best seller and traced the lives of five Radcliffe women from 1943 to 1983. Admirers saw it as fusing the sensibilities of Jane Austen and Mary McCarthy.         Not everyone was so enamored. Some critics found her work mannered and humorless. But she became a consistent seller, who was widely admired and sometimes imitated by other writers.         ''No one wrote better about the tangled relations of men and women or about the enduring romance of friendship,'' said Fran Kiernan, a former New Yorker editor, who edited Ms. Adams's New Yorker stories for 10 years, beginning with ''Beautiful Girl'' in 1977. ''She was a great romantic, with the highest expectations of life. As a writer, she was unfailingly wise.''         Ms. Adams's stories have appeared in 22 O'Henry Awards collections and in several volumes of ''Best American Short Stories.'' She received an Academy and Institute Award in Literature from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters.         Tall and striking looking, with short blond hair, turning gray, Ms. Adams was known for her sense of style as well as for her liberal politics and her wry view of life.         Describing the difficulty of writing as one ages, she said, ''Some smart person once said that what happens is your critical standards rise, and your talent does not necessarily increase in a commensurate way.''       
         Shirley Katzander, a public relations consultant who specialized in promoting cultural and political figures, died on Wednesday at her home in Manhattan. She was 78.         She had congestive heart failure, a friend, James A. Moore, said.         For nearly 20 years, Mrs. Katzander ran her own public relations company, which included among its clients at various times Reading Is Fundamental, a federally funded organization that encouraged reading among inner-city children, and Playboy magazine.         During the 1950's and 60's Mrs. Katzander was a fixture at The Reporter, the liberal, anti-Communist magazine edited by Max Ascoli. There she promoted the work of the magazine's writers, among them Meg Greenfield, Marya Mannes and George Bailey.         After the magazine closed in 1968, she worked briefly for Senator Jacob K. Javits, Republican of New York.         Mrs. Katzander was born Shirley Saltzman on Jan. 31, 1921, in Philadelphia. Almost immediately on graduation from high school, she was hired as a reporter at The Philadelphia Inquirer, covering the city's nightlife.         She married Howard L. Katzander, also a reporter, just as the war in Europe started. When it ended, they moved to Frankfurt, Germany, where Mr. Katzander wrote for Stars and Stripes and Mrs. Katzander was a copy editor. They returned to New York City in the early 1950's and divorced in 1957.         She is survived by a brother, Edward Saltzman of Somers Point, N.J.       
         Virginia Wise Marx, an educator and psychologist who dedicated herself to the care of children and their families, died last Sunday at White Plains Hospital. She was 93 and lived in Scarsdale, N.Y.         Since the early 1930's, Mrs. Marx had been involved in community affairs and a wide array of agencies. She set up remedial programs in five school districts and helped establish Westchester County's first full-time child guidance clinic.         More recently she devoted herself to the creation and expansion of a day care center at Westchester Community College. Now known as the Virginia Marx Children's Center, it serves nearly 100 children.         Many of their parents are single mothers on public assistance who attend the college. She created another center at Teachers College, Columbia University, for training educators in child care.         She and her husband, a New York developer, endowed the Virginia and Leonard Marx Professorship in Child and Parent Development and Education at Teachers College in 1993, as well the Marx Lecture Series at Teachers College. That program allows the college to give a platform to top researchers in child development. She also served on the advisory board of the Center for Infants and Parents.         Born in St. Louis, she graduated with a degree in psychology from  Washington University, then received a master's in social work. She  earned a master's in child psychology at Teachers College and spent a fellowship year in clinical psychology at what was then its Child Guidance Institute.         Before her marriage in 1930, she  designed children's toys for Macy's and was a contributing editor for Parents magazine. Her quarterly articles advised readers about child development.         Among Mrs. Marx's beneficiaries were the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services, where she was a trustee for over 40 years and a longtime member of its Child Development Center committee. She supported its training branch, the Selig Educational Institute, and the Center for the Study of Social Work Practice, a joint undertaking with Columbia.         Other charities included UJA-Federation of New York, White Plains Hospital Center, Scarsdale Edgemont Family Counseling Service, and Camp Rainbow, a UJA affiliate serving handicapped children. Her interest in American antique furniture fueled her support of the American Wing of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Friends of American Art at Yale University, and the Art Museum of Sarah Lawrence College.         Mrs. Marx is survived by her husband; their son, Leonard Jr. of Greenwich, Conn.; two daughters, Mary Lynn Bianco of Los Angeles, and Jennifer Gruenberg of Scarsdale; two sisters, Muriel Ducibella of Orange, Conn., and Jane Smith of St. Louis; a brother, Rudolph Wise Jr. of Baldwin, Mo.; six grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.       
         Marjorie Lederer Lee, a novelist and poet, died Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 78 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, her son John said.         Ms. Lee drew on her experiences as a young mother of five in Bryn Mawr, Pa., to write about suburbanites in her first novel, ''The Lion House.'' Among her other works were the novels ''The Eye of Summer'' and ''Dr. Block and the Human Condition'' and a book of poetry,  ''What Have You Done All Day.''         Ms. Lee, who was born Marjorie Ruth Lederer in Manhattan, began writing at a young age. By the time she was 13, her poetry and short stories had appeared in publications like Mademoiselle, Harper's Bazaar and McCall's.         She was a graduate of Sarah Lawrence College, to which she had earned a full scholarship. While a student there, she wrote the words to the Sarah Lawrence College song, set to a 17th-century Dutch carol. The song had its premiere at her  commencement ceremony in 1944. It fell out of use by the early 1950's.         After college, she married Robert Lee and in her early 20's was the poetry editor of The Ladies' Home Journal. Several of her own poems were set to music and performed by Dinah Shore and Martha Raye, among others.         In her youth, Ms. Lee was the constant companion of her first cousin Richard Avedon, the photographer.         ''She was the source of my energy, the front-runner of everything intellectual, inventive and original in our most formative years,'' Mr. Avedon said.         In addition to her son John, of Manhattan, she is survived by two other sons, Robert Jr., of Haverford, Pa., and Steven, of West Nyack, N.Y.; two daughters, Alison, of Berkeley, Calif., and Jordan, of Nashville, and nine grandchildren.       
         Meg Greenfield, the editor of The Washington Post's editorial page, who brought a combination of sharp-eyed analysis and wry wit to bear on a generation of the nation's policy makers and politicians, died yesterday morning at her home in Washington. She was 68.         She died of cancer, said The Post's publisher, Donald E. Graham. The cancer had been diagnosed three years before, but not until the last six weeks did the disease sap her strength enough to silence her tart editorial voice. Her last column appeared in The Post on March 15.         Fred Hiatt, an editorial-page colleague, said yesterday, ''When it was time for her column, no matter how her body was conspiring against her, she would summon this incredible force of will and turn out a column that the rest of us would envy.''         In four decades as a reporter, editorialist and quietly influential opinion maker in the nation's capital, Miss Greenfield provided a stream of informed commentary that had an impact on the public perception of six Presidential administrations and scores of policy debates, ranging from affirmative action and abortion rights to the Panama Canal treaties and the Persian Gulf war. In 1978, when she was The Post's deputy editorial page editor, she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize for commentary.         In her role as the newspaper's editorial-page editor for the last 20 years and as a columnist for Newsweek magazine for 25 years, Miss Greenfield pored over the details of policy with the passion of a political scientist and wrote of the complex architecture of democracy with reverence. She also perfected a tone of sly mockery and an eye for the absurd, both of which informed the best of her work.         ''Meg has had a big influence,'' said Jodie Allen, who was lured into journalism by Miss Greenfield and is now a senior writer at U.S. News & World Report. ''She set the tone of debate early, before it became conventional wisdom. It's hard to see, because so many things she pioneered, like neoliberalism, are now in the water supply.''         Though capable of a passion for social justice, she sometimes irritated the city's progressive circles with her skepticism about any government's abilities to keep fallible citizens up to some moral mark. She also arched an editorial eyebrow at what she considered blunderbuss attacks on the conservative policies of the Reagan Administration.         A hands-on manager of both the editorial and op-ed pages of The Post, Miss Greenfield also spotted and showcased intellectual talent. Washington writers and commentators, including George Will, Michael Kinsley, Roger W. Wilkins and Charles Kraut hammer credit Miss Greenfield with starting or fast-forwarding their careers.         Her friends and confidants were legion, including Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Alice M. Rivlin, the vice chairwoman of the Federal Reserve Board. Miss Greenfield's diminutive figure was a fixture in the elite dining rooms of Georgetown, where she lived near the home of her employer, who was also among her closest friends, Katharine Graham, the chairwoman of the executive committee of the Washington Post Company, which owns both The Post and Newsweek. She was also close to Mrs. Graham's son, Donald, who is the company's current chairman and chief executive as well as The Post's publisher.         ''Meg was unique in her mind, character, and affinity for hard work,'' Mrs. Graham said in a statement yesterday. ''She was both brilliant and funny, a writer and an editor of amazing ability. She will be missed by all those affected by her original, independent thinking, by her family, her colleagues, and her close friends.''         As an editorialist, she was both a judge and a connoisseur of the foibles of the city's political and intellectual elites. ''Her mark was her obliqueness,'' Mr. Will said. ''Most columnists are Hemingway. She's Henry James, using understatement, nuance, indirection. It lasts better.''         Though missing in action from the televised punditry that began to dominate the nation's political discussion in the 1980's and 1990's, Miss Greenfield wielded her influence in many other venues, from the dinner parties of the powerful to the Columbia University offices where, from 1986 to 1995, she sat in judgment on her colleagues' work as a member of the Pulitzer Prize Board.         She also had a keen sensibility for literature, history, fact and hypocrisy, and what dose of each goes into a person's reputation. That sensibility shone through one of her last columns, ''Goodbye, Columbus,'' in which she discussed the attitude of President Clinton's supporters toward Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia.         ''Senator Byrd was seen for a time as just another starchy, retrograde legislator, all hung up on the archaic lore of the Senate, ceaselessly spouting citations and precedents from the Constitution,'' she wrote. ''To be rude about it, as they were, they dismissed him as a bore.         ''But when it became apparent that his inclination and his own studies were leading him not to a love of Clinton or even to a degree of political solidarity with him, let alone any sympathy for what he did, but rather to conclusions about the Constitution that would be advantageous to Clinton, all that quickly changed. Byrd became in the Clinton supporters' depiction a great Roman statesman, a man beyond reproach -- a living, walking, breathing toga.''         Mary Ellen Greenfield -- she derived Meg from her initials -- was born on Dec. 27, 1930, in Seattle, where her father, Lewis Greenfield, ran an antiques business. She graduated summa cum laude from Smith College in 1952, with a major in English literature, then spent a year as a Fulbright Scholar at Cambridge University in England, specializing in William Blake's works.         After considering an academic career, Miss Greenfield decided on journalism instead, joining The Reporter, a magazine of analysis and commentary, in 1957 as a researcher in its Washington bureau.         After three years of largely anonymous work, she published, in the heat of the 1960 Presidential campaign between Richard M. Nixon and John F. Kennedy, a scathing intellectual profile of Mr. Nixon.         ''Refusal to answer a question by setting up a straw man to attack instead is a not uncommon device of debating,'' she wrote. ''But in Nixon's prose the straw man emerges as more than a debating device: it is an innate feature of his thinking. Nixon apparently finds it almost impossible to make a statement that is not, in some manner, an argument. Ideas never quite exist for him until they have been pitted against something else -- an extreme danger, a radically different point of view, or a potential attack from some sinister quarter.''         Miss Greenfield was promoted to staff writer at the magazine in 1961 and in 1965 became its Washington editor. When The Reporter shut down in 1968, Miss Greenfield became the first person hired by Philip Geyelin, the newly appointed editorial page editor of The Washington Post. One of Mr. Geyelin's early goals was to turn The Post away from the hawkish stance on the Vietnam War favored by its departing editorial page editor, J. Russell Wiggins.         As Mr. Geyelin and Mrs. Graham recount it, Miss Greenfield paid a courtesy call on Mr. Wiggins. Afterward, the unreconstructed cold warrior said to his dovish successor: ''My boy, you're making the mistake of your life. She's on my side.''         Few others would try to pigeonhole Miss Greenfield in the years that followed.         A year after she arrived at The Post, Mr. Geyelin made Miss Greenfield his deputy. A decade later, she replaced him. Even though she rose to the top of her profession during the years that saw the rise of the feminist movement, Miss Greenfield kept a studied distance from it.         Still, Miss Greenfield gleefully skewered some of the racism and sexism of the city's journalistic culture. In 1970, she solicited an op-ed article from Mr. Wilkins, a prominent black intellectual and policy analyst, about the Gridiron Dinner.         The piece focused on the raw humor featured at the dinner, which is an annual off-the-record event that brings the city's journalistic and political elites together for assorted high jinks. ''It was a piece that really kind of blew the town apart because people were not supposed to write about the Gridiron and I wrote about how racist that particular dinner was,'' Mr. Wilkins said.         Miss Greenfield and Mrs. Graham toured another Gridiron from the outside, trying to get a feel for the women's protests while ducking behind the dashboard of a car to avoid being seen. After the barriers fell, Miss Greenfield was a frequent guest at Gridiron dinners, attending the most recent one earlier this year.         An avid reader of literature, Miss Greenfield studied Latin in the 1970's so she could read more classic works. She was also a perennial on the college commencement circuit, receiving honorary degrees from Smith, Georgetown University, Wesleyan University, Williams College and Princeton University.         When she first became ill with lung cancer, Miss Greenfield returned to the region where she grew up and bought a home in the Puget Sound area. The property also allowed her more time to see her nephews and nieces. Her late brother's five children are her only remaining relatives.         In 1980, she wrote a mock lament to the knee-jerk excesses of her chosen profession. The piece was inspired by an embarrassing mistake at The Boston Globe that let a joke headline, ''More Mush From the Wimp,'' sneak into the newspaper over an editorial about a speech by President Jimmy Carter. After 100,000 copies were on the street, it was replaced with the headline ''All Must Share the Burden.''         ''That's the part that got us,'' Miss Greenfield wrote. ''All Must Share the Burden.'' She continued: ''Just put us in the presence of that headline and, we can't help ourselves, we start automatically and compulsively writing the editorial that goes with it. It's all about how men of good will should cease the bootless acrimony as there can be no winners in this tragic dispute and the biggest losers of all will be -- are you ready? -- well, of course, the nation's children.''         She added: ''When the end of the world finally comes about and editorial writers are all called to judgment, it won't be the headline pranks run amok, that sort of thing, that will get us. No, it will be all those other miles of editorial prose that fit so nicely under the headline ''All Must Share the Burden'' for which we will, collectively, fry.''       
         Shirley Potash Clurman, a retired magazine editor and television producer, died yesterday at St. Rose's Home in Manhattan. She was 74 and lived on the Upper East Side.         The cause was cancer, her family said.         Mrs. Clurman, a native of Los Angeles, began her career in the publicity department of 20th Century Fox before moving to New York to work as an assistant to Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d.         She did public relations work for Time Inc. and, until the early 1960's, for the Rockefeller family, then worked as an editor at People magazine. When she retired, she was working for ABC News as an associate producer of the news magazine program ''20/20.''         Mrs. Clurman was the widow of Richard M. Clurman, a longtime leader in New York City's cultural life and former chief of correspondents and head of Time-Life News Service. He died three years ago. She is survived by their son, Michael, of Manhattan; two stepdaughters, Susan Emma Clurman of Manhattan and Carol Mae Duning of Alexandria, Va., and a sister, Ellen Schwartz of Waco, Tex.       
         Francine Everett, a singer, dancer and actress who was one of the stars of the all-black cast ''race'' movies of the 30's and 40's, died at a nursing home in the Bronx on May 27.         She gave her birth year as 1920, however by 1933 she was already appearing with the Four Black Cats, a nightclub variety act. Shortly thereafter, she began acting with the Federal Theater in Harlem, which was sponsored by the Works Progress Administration.         After marrying the actor Rex Ingram, she moved to Hollywood in 1936. Upon her arrival, she is said to have turned down a part as one of the angels in the Warner Brothers all-black spectacle ''Green Pastures,'' in which her husband starred as De Lawd, and she later refused to accept the stereotypical roles of servants that were offered by the studios.         Her marriage to Mr. Ingram ended in divorce in 1939, and Ms. Everett returned to Harlem. She quickly became a familiar face as a lead in low-budget, independently produced black films like ''Keep Punching'' (1939), which starred the boxing champion Henry Armstrong; ''Big Timers'' (circa 1945), which featured Moms Mabley and Stepin Fetchit, and ''Dirty Gerty From Harlem U.S.A.'' (1946), which was directed by Spencer Williams Jr., who later portrayed Andy in the ''Amos 'n' Andy'' television series.         Among her Hollywood film credits were bit parts in ''Lost Boundaries'' (1949) and in Sidney Poitier's first film, ''No Way Out'' (1950), which was her final appearance on the screen.         The entertainment historian Henry T. Sampson said that Ms. Everett  and Edna Mae Harris were the last of the leading ladies of the all-black films. The cultural historian and lecturer Delilah Jackson said that Billy Rowe, an editor of The Pittsburgh Courier and writer for The Amsterdam News in New York, called Ms. Everett ''the most beautiful woman in Harlem.''         The former actor and award-winning filmmaker and producer William Greaves said that Ms. Everett  ''was a true legend of black film and theater, one of the top stars of the 40's race movies.''         He added, ''She would have been a superstar in Hollywood were it not for the apartheid climate in America and the movie industry at the time.''         Her arresting looks may not have benefited her career as a Hollywood player at a time when black actresses were rarely portrayed as glamorous, but they served her well as a model and singer.         As a vocalist, Ms. Everett appeared in more than 50 ''soundies,'' short musical films featuring the most renowned jazz and popular musicians of the 1940's. One was the 1947 release ''Ebony on Parade,'' which starred Dorothy Dandridge, Cab Calloway and the Count Basie band. She was also a popular print model who appeared in clothing and cosmetic advertisements in the 40's.         She is survived by an aunt, Lucy Williams.         Ms. Everett retired from show business in the 1950's. She held a clerical job at Harlem Hospital until her retirement in 1985. But she maintained a keen interest in black film and entertainment. She was a member of the Negro Actors' Guild and often lectured and participated on panels and in seminars sponsored by the International Agency for Minority Artists Affairs, which promotes black films.       
         Ruth Whitney, the editor who steered Glamour magazine for 31 years and influenced several generations of women during three important decades in American feminism, died yesterday at her home in Irvington, N.Y. She was 71.         The cause was Lou Gehrig's disease, or amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, said her daughter-in-law, Christina Ferrari.         Mrs. Whitney was the editor in chief of Glamour, a magazine owned by Conde Nast Publications that now has a circulation of 2.1 million readers, from 1967 until last September. Part of her mission, she said, was to make feminism accessible, not intimidating, to American women.         Her reputation for frankness reached into the pages of Glamour, where -- along with the standard fare of women's magazines, like frothy fashion spreads and light service articles -- she published articles about sexuality, politics and women's health issues that other women's magazines had generally avoided. And her editorial decisions -- like putting a black model on the cover of Glamour in 1968, a first in the women's magazine industry -- sometimes caused a stir in magazine circles.         In an interview a week before she retired last September, Mrs. Whitney explained her goal as editor in chief of Glamour: ''I always felt that I had a mission. I wanted to broaden the scope of a magazine to go with women's lives. I never wanted to appeal to everyone. That's not what we were about, and that's not the secret of our success. But I really wanted to make women feel good about themselves, not just about what they wore.''         Mrs. Whitney's origins were more humble than glamorous. She was born Ruth Reinke is Oshkosh, Wis., on July 23, 1928. Her mother, Helen, was a housewife, and her father, Leonard, was a designer of gravestones and mausoleums, but the only effect her father's choice of career had on her, she said last year, was that she learned to drive in a cemetery.         She was awarded a scholarship to Northwestern University, where she met Daniel Whitney, a journalism student; they married shortly after her 21st birthday. Unlike her husband, who attended journalism school but eventually ran his own advertising agency, Mrs. Whitney decided against professional journalism training and went straight to work for Time Inc. as a promotional copywriter. She didn't last long in the job.         ''It was an election year and I was madly for Adlai,'' she said. ''And the company was not madly for Adlai. So I got more and more sullen and eventually they fired me.'' To her dismay, the young Mrs. Whitney found that she could not get a job writing for Newsweek or Fortune.         ''What I always say next,'' she said, ''was that if you had a uterus, you couldn't write for those magazines.'' She found a job in women's magazines and, at 28, became editor in chief of a now-defunct magazine called Better Living, then of Seventeen. She arrived at Glamour in 1967.         During her tenure the magazine won four National Magazine Awards, including two for general excellence, in 1981 and 1991, and one in the public interest category in 1992, for a series conceived by Mrs. Whitney on the availability and safety of abortions in America. Until her death, she served on the board of the NOW Legal Defense Fund.         While she was editor, she kept a low profile. She never ran an editor's note at the front of the magazine and refused parties for her 20th, 25th and 30th anniversaries as editor in chief. When S. I. Newhouse Jr., the chairman of Advance Publications, the parent company of Conde Nast, asked her what she would like for her 25th anniversary, she asked that he establish two scholarships in her name at the Newhouse School of Journalism at Syracuse University.         Despite her low-key manner, she was fond of controversy. When she wanted to feature the black model on the cover of Glamour in 1968, the issue was debated at every level of the company, all the way up to the president. ''I never shied away from controversy,'' Mrs. Whitney said last year. ''It's always good for you.''         And she was a champion of women who confronted authority. In October  1991, just as Anita Hill began testifying on Capitol Hill against the nomination of Clarence Thomas to the Supreme Court, Mrs. Whitney closed the December issue of the magazine -- with its special feature on notable women of the year -- and went home to watch the hearings. On Sunday she called her production manager and said that she wanted to reconfigure the issue to include Ms. Hill as one of the notable women, which she did, beating most monthly magazines to an interview with Ms. Hill.         Gloria Steinem, a former contributing editor to Glamour, said that decisions like those defined the magazine under Mrs. Whitney. ''She was always trying to get as much real information into the pages of a fashion and beauty magazine as she possibly could,'' Ms. Steinem said.         The combination of fashion and service with strong editorial articles worked especially well on the newsstand. Glamour is second in circulation in its field only to Cosmopolitan. Conde Nast is a privately held company and does not disclose the earnings of its magazines, but in 1997 Steven T. Florio, the chief executive officer, said that Glamour's annual profits were in the ''tens of millions of dollars.''         Richard B. Stolley, the first managing editor of People and now the senior editorial adviser at Time Inc., said that Mrs. Whitney's rare longevity in the magazine industry could be attributed to her forward thinking.         ''She truly tried to turn her readers into not only capable women,'' he said, ''but functioning citizens of America, with all the knowledge and concerns that she felt young women ought to have. And of course she was right.''         The magazine business was long a family enterprise. Mrs. Whitney's husband served as her sounding board on all editorial matters until his death in 1995. Her son, Philip, who survives her, was until last year an executive at Money magazine; his wife, Christina Ferrari, is the managing editor of Teen People magazine. She is also survived by a brother, Leonard Reinke, of Oshkosh.       
         Trudi Schoop, a popular Swiss-born comic dancer who became a pioneer in the use of dance movement to treat mental illness, died on July 14 at her home in Van Nuys, Calif. She was 95.         Throughout the 1930's Miss Schoop was often called a female Charlie Chaplin because of the way she, like Chaplin, could combine merriment with pathos. But in the mid-40's she gave up performing to explore ways in which dance could serve as therapy for schizophrenic patients.         The daughter of a Zurich newspaper editor, Miss Schoop was essentially self-taught, although she did take some ballet and modern-dance lessons after she had already established herself as a performer. By the early 30's she was spending much of her time traveling with her company, and she made several American tours under the auspices of the impresario Sol Hurok.         Miss Schoop specialized in comic suites based upon the misadventures of a central figure. She played a male character who was frequently likened to Chaplin's Little Tramp in ''Fridolin on the Road.'' Reviewing its New York premiere for The New York Times in 1935, John Martin called Miss Schoop ''agreeable and clever,'' but also ''obvious and naive.'' Two years later, he was more enthusiastic about ''Blonde Marie,'' finding this depiction of an awkward but endearing servant girl notable for its ''great gusto and good humor.''         Miss Schoop remained in Switzerland throughout World War II, often performing in anti-Fascist cabaret shows. When the war ended, she resumed touring, offering a New York season in 1947. Soon thereafter she settled in the Los Angeles area and began a second career as a therapist.         Working with several California medical institutions, including Camarillo State Mental Hospital, she developed what she called ''body-ego technique,'' which used movement to help lead patients out of isolation so that they could respond to, rather than shrink from, human contact.         No immediate family members survive.       
         Marguerite W. Cullman, a longtime theatrical investor who was also an author, died yesterday in her apartment on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 94, and her main residence was in Purchase, N.Y.         After working as an editor of the old Stage magazine, Mrs. Cullman began investing with her husband, Howard S. Cullman, who was chairman of what was then called the Port of New York Authority and was prominent in the tobacco industry, serving on the board of Philip Morris  Inc. He died in 1972.         The couple began investing in Broadway productions in the 1930's because, as their children said yesterday, while Mrs. Cullman worked at Stage she liked to be sure that a play the magazine wrote about would not fold before the next issue appeared.         As a family story has it, Mrs. Cullman proved prescient in guessing on behalf of the magazine which plays would prove durable. When her husband learned that, he proposed that she read the scripts of forthcoming Broadway productions and he study the financial prospectuses issued by their producers.         After Mrs. Cullman left the magazine, the couple began their investing, which continued into the 1970's and brought them renown for their shrewdness and energy.         Robert Whitehead, the theatrical producer, recalled last night, ''I could see that she got a kick out of the theater and a kick out of being associated with it through investment.''         Among the hits that the Cullmans helped bring to the stage were ''Life With Father,'' ''Oklahoma!,'' ''Carousel,'' ''Brigadoon,'' ''South Pacific,'' ''Annie Get Your Gun,'' ''Fiddler on the Roof,'' ''Teahouse of the August Moon,'' ''Death of Salesman'' and ''A Streetcar Named Desire.''         During the 1940's and 1950's, their children said, the couple's success rate was so high that their participation in a forthcoming show was enough to guarantee its full funding.         Marguerite Sanders, as she then was, was born and reared in Manhattan, attended Columbia University, worked as a writer and editor for the McNaught Newspaper Syndicate and contributed articles to The New York Times Magazine, The New Yorker and other publications.         In addition, she wrote two books, ''Occupation Angel'' (1962), about Broadway, and ''Ninety Dozen Glasses'' (1960), about her life with Mr. Cullman in 1958, when he was the United States Commissioner for the World's Fair in Brussels.         She was also vice chairman of the Lighthouse for the Blind and served on the board of the Spence-Chapin Home for Adoption.         An early marriage was annulled. She married Mr. Cullman in 1935.         She is survived by a daughter, Marguerite P. Cullman of Severna Park, Md.; a son, Brian Henry Cullman of Manhattan; two stepsons, Hugh Cullman of Beaufort, N.C., and Paul T. Cullman of Ferndale, Wash.; 12 grandchildren and 25 great-grandchildren.       
         Brenda Hughes Moore, a human-rights advocate and arts consultant and the wife of the Right Rev. Paul Moore Jr., retired bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of New York, died Sunday at New York Presbyterian Hospital. She was 56 and lived in Greenwich Village and Stonington, Conn.         The cause was hepatitis, her husband said.         A native of Richmond, Mrs. Moore graduated from Salem College in North Carolina and studied at the University of Aix-Marseille and the University of Perugia.         She accompanied her first husband, John Franklin Campbell, a Foreign Service officer, to Ethiopia, where she became a special assistant to Emperor Haile Selassie and arranged a national exposition of Ethiopian crafts. She was also interested in the cause of Eritrea, then seeking independence from Ethiopia. Back in the United States, she assisted her husband, the first editor of Foreign Policy and author of ''The Foreign Affairs Fudge Factory.''         Mr. Campbell died in 1971 at age 31, and the next year she married Vernon Eagle, then the executive director of the New World Foundation, which supported civil rights and community projects.         The year after Mr. Eagle's death in 1974, she married Bishop Moore, who had officiated at her second wedding and had himself recently been widowed. She later received a degree from Yeshiva University as an arts appraiser.         In 1989 she and Bishop Moore visited the island of East Timor, and for the rest of her life she championed the cause of autonomy for East Timor.         Besides her husband, Mrs. Moore's immediate survivors are two sisters, Stephanie Hughes of Phoenix, and Lisa Hughes of Honolulu.       
         Joan Wight, the widow of the Yorkshire veterinarian who wrote under the name James Herriot and the model for a character in his books and television programs based on them, died on Wednesday. She was in her 80's.         Ms. Wight's health slowly declined after her husband died in 1995 at age 78, said Thomas McCormack, the former editor in chief of St. Martin's Press, which published the first five Herriot books.         Her husband, whose real name was James Alfred Wight, vividly depicted his wife as the endearing and supportive Helen Herriot in his memoirs, beginning with ''All Creatures Great and Small.'' Mr. McCormack described Ms. Wight as the model for ''the humorous, loving and, from time to time, tolerating wife of James Herriot.''         ''All Creatures Great and Small'' became the basis for a long-running television series, which was originally a BBC-TV production and later a cable television series in the United States. Its accounts of rural life attracted an audience of millions around the world.         On television, Helen was played first by Carol Drinkwater and later by Lynda Bellingham. In a 1979 movie, ''All Things Bright and Beautiful,'' Helen was portrayed by Lisa Harrow.         Although ''All Creatures Great and Small'' became a best seller, it was not reviewed until months after its publication, when strongly positive word-of-mouth reports had begun to make it famous.         One episode in the first Herriot book describes how Ms. Wight met her future husband. She grew up on a farm in Yorkshire not far from ''the surgery,'' as Mr. Wight's veterinary hospital was known.         One day, she brought in a calf with a broken leg. Mr. Wight repaired the damage with a splint. Later, she brought in a dog with a dislocated hip, and this time, he had eyes only for her. They soon became engaged.         ''A characteristic scene comes in the final chapter of 'All Creatures Great and Small,' '' Mr. McCormack said. ''The scene tells of Joan's and James's honeymoon, which is interrupted by a sudden, mad crush of work, which kills their hope of taking a trip. As Joan sits with notebook on her knee and pencil at the ready, she smiles. It was a magnificent, loving ending.''         Ms. Wight is survived by a son, James, and a daughter, Rosemary Page, both of Yorkshire in northern England.       
         Elizabeth Forsling Harris, who was briefly the first publisher of Ms. magazine, died on July 14 in Manhattan, where she lived. She was 77.         She died in a hospital of complications from emphysema, said a friend, Patricia Reilly.         Ms. Harris helped start Ms. magazine in late 1971, but she left after the first issue, citing disagreement on a wide range of issues.         In 1975, she filed a suit for $1.7 million against the first editor of Ms., Gloria Steinem, and Pat Carbine, the publisher, contending that they had fraudulently misrepresented the value of the magazine's stock. The suit was dismissed.         After Ms. magazine, Ms. Harris worked in the early days of cable television, developing a shopping service called Cable Catalog with Neiman Marcus. In 1976, she became the publisher of Working Woman. In the early 1980's, she was a deputy commissioner at the New York State Department of Commerce.         Ms. Harris was born in Greeneville, Tenn., on Jan. 8, 1922, and graduated from Mount Vernon College in Washington.         In 1941, she took a job at Newsweek in New York as a researcher. She later became a radio and television editor. In 1951, she joined ABC, where she produced a program featuring Walter Winchell, and was one of the network's first programming executives.         Two years later, she left to start her own public relations company in Dallas, where she remained through the late 1950's, until she became a special consultant for Arthur Godfrey Productions in New York.         In 1961, she was the deputy associate director of the Peace Corps. She returned to Dallas in July 1963 and was the local White House liaison for President John F. Kennedy's visit on Nov. 22, 1963.         After the Kennedy assassination, she returned to Washington, where she again worked for the Peace Corps and the Democratic National Committee.         She later worked for the Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. in New York, the Urban Institute research organization in Washington and CRM Inc., in Del Mar, Calif., the publisher of Psychology Today.         Ms. Harris was the first president of the Women's Forum, a networking organization, served on the board of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and was a trustee of Mount Vernon College and Tusculum College in Tusculum, Tenn.         No immediate survivors were reported.       
         Celestine Sibley, an Atlanta newspaper columnist who for 55 years wrote about the commonplaces of Southern life in a prose as soothing as the hum of cicadas in summer, died on Sunday at her vacation home on Dog Island, Fla.         Ms. Sibley was 85, and her last column was published in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on July 25.         In it, she writes of her own invalid's insomnia, when her thoughts turn to Key lime pie (''you stumble a bit fishing it out of the refrigerator, and Key lime has a tendency to slither'') and quilts (''when they are old and faded and weightless, you pull them up and remember the women who made them and the families they 'kivvered' with them'').         There were few regional columnists who could match Ms. Sibley for longevity, although the columnist Herb Caen of The San Francisco Chronicle did stretch his career over 58 years before his death in 1997.         But unlike other proud regional voices -- Mike Royko in Chicago or Atlanta's own Ralph McGill -- Ms. Sibley was not forceful as she passed on her musings about minutiae: choosing a Christmas tree, baking a pie, daydreaming about a Civil War battle and forgetting to pay a toll in the process. Echoes of the novelist Margaret Mitchell's ability to describe and evoke nostalgia run throughout Ms. Sibley's work.         ''It was a country-girl-come-to-the-city kind of column,'' said Bill Kovach, a former editor of The Journal-Constitution, who is curator of the Nieman Foundation for Journalism at Harvard University. ''She was the last voice of the white-glove, tea-and-apple-blossom set that had not a sharp edge on it.''         Ms. Sibley was born near Pensacola, Fla., and joined The Atlanta Constitution as a reporter in 1941, covering murder trials and Georgia Statehouse politics. She was assigned her first column in 1944 when she had to take time away from the office to be with her children.         ''For generations and generations of Georgians, she embodied the South, the simple, folksy, homespun South,'' said Cynthia Tucker, the editorial page editor of The Constitution. But, Ms. Tucker cautioned, Ms. Sibley ''was not as one-dimensional'' as her columns about gardens and scotch pines, dogwoods and azaleas  might indicate. ''This was an intelligent woman with a lot of backbone,'' she said.         An article in The Journal-Constitution last week described Ms. Sibley's rebuff to Gov. Jimmy Carter after he had sent a letter to every state legislator disputing an article she had written about the legislative maneuvering involving one of the Governor's bills. When Mr. Carter invited her to his office to discuss the issue, she refused, saying, ''You mean you want to insult me publicly and apologize in private.''         And years after the racial turmoil of the 1960's that transformed the South, Ms. Sibley wrote a 1990 column about the movie ''Driving Miss Daisy,'' marked by a sharpness and almost rueful tone. Writing of a scene in the movie when painfully complacent Atlantans hear themselves chastised for inaction in the civil rights battles, Ms. Sibley said, ''It was an Atlanta attitude at the time, and many Atlantans took it like Miss Daisy, listening and looking at the empty chair beside her where her black servant and best friend, Hoke, should have been sitting if her courage had matched her good will.''         Ms. Sibley also wrote 25 books, most of them mystery novels, including some that featured Kate Kincaid, a reporter at The Atlanta Searchlight.         Her first husband, Jim Little, died  at age 45. Her second husband, James Strong, died in 1988. She is survived by two daughters, Susan Sibley Little Bazemore of Des Moines and Mary Everitt Little-Vance of Roswell, Ga.; a son, James W. Little 5th of Alford, Fla.; eight grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.       
         Raisa Maksimovna Gorbachev, who broke Kremlin tradition by sharing the spotlight with her husband, the former Soviet President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, and did so with bold self-assurance and flair, died today in Munster, Germany. She was 67.         The cause was leukemia, aides to Mr. Gorbachev said. She had been under treatment in University Hospital in Munster since late July.         Mr. Gorbachev's rise to the leadership of the Communist Party in 1985 was the first sign of a seismic shift in the Soviet Union's calcified politics and economy. But it was Raisa Gorbachev who, both at home and abroad, soon came to embody the changes to come. She emerged as a First Lady who had her own mind, her own style and according to reports of a secret videotape that circulated after one of her foreign trips, her own American Express card.         None of this endeared her to the Soviet public, who began to grumble early in her husband's tenure that she was too pushy, too flashy and too influential. Her appearances on foreign trips and her cultural projects at home stirred debate in many Russian kitchens over whether the proper place for Kremlin wives was -- as it had always been -- at home, or at least in the background.         But since the beginning of this month, when Russians first learned that their former First Lady had been hospitalized in Germany with an advanced and rare case of leukemia, sentiments toward her in Russia began to shift. Favorable articles began to appear in the press, and thousands of letters and telegrams of sympathy arrived at the hospital in Munster, where her husband kept a faithful vigil that touched many Russian hearts. ''It must be in the Russian character -- to run somebody into the mud, and them laud them to high heavens after a tragedy strikes,'' said Vladimir Polyakov, a Gorbachev spokesman.         President Boris N. Yeltsin, Mr. Gorbachev's bitter rival in the early 1990's, sent a message of condolence today, and in a statement he said that a ''wonderful person, a beautiful woman, a loving wife and mother is no longer with us.''         In his autobiography, published in 1996, Mr. Gorbachev acknowledged that the resentment over his wife's high profile surfaced in letters written to the Communist Party's Central Committee. ''Who does she think she is, a member of the Politburo?'' he quoted one as saying. ''The simplest answer would have been: 'No, she is my wife.' ''         She first became known in the West in 1984 when she accompanied her husband, then a ranking member of the Soviet Politburo, to Britain, where they were received by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. Diplomats and reporters, scanning the couple for clues about the next generation of Soviet leaders, quickly focused up on her wardrobe -- in particular her gold lame sandals with chain straps, a far cry from the dowdy shoes worn by other Kremlin wives. On a later trip to France, the French press labeled her clothes ''elegant, but not chic.''         On her foreign travels, she also became known for a haughty conversational style that bordered on the pedantic. During the 1986 summit meeting in Reykjavik, Iceland, she needled her tour guides with persistent questioning, adding didactic commentary of her own. Visiting the United States for the first time in 1987, she irked Nancy Reagan with lectures on subjects ranging from architecture to socialism, reportedly prompting the American President's wife to quip, ''Who does that dame think she is?''         As she became more comfortable in her role as the Soviet First Lady, she loosened up and her wardrobe became more subdued. On a visit to Washington in 1990, she established more friendly relations with Barbara Bush, from whom she got a recipe for blueberry pie.         Born in the Siberian city of Rubtsovsk, Raisa Titarenko grew up as the daughter of a railway engineer. She graduated from school with a gold medal -- top honors in the Soviet system -- and went on to the prestigious University of Moscow. She was studying philosophy there when she met Mr. Gorbachev, then a law student. According to his book, he was smitten, but she was aloof.         ''Our first meeting had not impressed Raisa at all,'' he wrote. ''She seemed calm and indifferent -- judging by the look in her eyes.'' Not much later, at an impromptu party staged by Mr. Gorbachev's roommates for Raisa and her friends, ''I wanted to impress her,'' he wrote, but ''I think I made a terrible fool of myself. She was reserved and was the first to suggest breaking up the gathering.''         After an intense courtship, the two penniless students were married in 1953, the year of Stalin's death. They had one daughter, Irina, born in 1956, who survives her along with Mr. Gorbachev and two granddaughters.         After the couple completed their college work in 1955, the family returned to Mr. Gorbachev's home region of Stavropol in southern Russia. There Mrs. Gorbachev completed a doctoral dissertation, entitled ''The Emergence of New Characteristics in the Daily Life of Collective Farm Peasantry,'' based on an unusual amount of field research, which was accepted by the Lenin Pedagogical Institute in Moscow.         When her husband, then first party secretary in Stavropol, was promoted to Moscow as a Central Committee secretary in charge of agriculture, she returned to academics, taking a job as lecturer in philosophy at Moscow University, a position which she gave up when he became General Secretary of the Communist Party.         As the wife of the Soviet leader, she was enlisted as a board member of the Soviet Cultural Foundation, headed by Dmitri S. Likhachev, one of Russia's most distinguished academicians, which was created to promote the arts and to restore the country's cultural heritage.         In this role, she became one of her husband's conduits to the Russian intelligentsia, which was then rallying to his call for more ''glasnost,'' or openness. As Soviet censorship eased, the Soviet people rushed to rediscover books and parts of their own history that had been buried under a rigid Communist ideology.         Mrs. Gorbachev's most traumatic moments came during the August 1991 coup, when the Gorbachevs were held hostage at a seaside villa in the Crimea while a group of Communist hard-liners tried to seize control in Moscow. The coup failed, and Mr. Gorbachev and his family returned to Moscow, visibly shaken. ''Raisa Maksimovna took it very hard,'' said Mr. Gorbachev at a news conference after their return to Moscow.         In 1991, Raisa Gorbachev published a book of reminiscences, entitled in English, ''I Hope,'' which she decided to write after a visit with Mrs. Bush in 1990 to Wellesley College where, she said, ''the girls showered me with questions.'' Reviewers found the book self-serving in parts but also informative about the couple's intellectual journey as, together, they came to realize the flaws in the Soviet system.         In her last years, Mrs. Gorbachev started a club that drew together a dozen well-known and high-powered Russian women for conferences, charitable projects and informal debates. She described the group as an attempt to promote a civil society in Russia. Against her wishes, the club became known as the Raisa Maksimovna Club.         Lyudmila Telen, a deputy editor at the newspaper Moscow News and a member of the club, said her impressions of Mrs. Gorbachev changed as she got to know her better. ''She set herself very high goals -- she felt she had to improve herself,'' said Ms. Telen. ''Going from wife of a provincial first secretary to First Lady was a big jump.         ''She wanted to represent the country in a new way. She understood that what Mikhail Sergeyevich was doing was a revolution, but she had many complexes, too -- a natural reserve and a Soviet way of behavior that she tried to overcome.''         Ms. Telen said Mrs. Gorbachev was well aware of the resentment against her felt by many Russians. But she herself was never bitter. ''She realized that people had been used to different women, different traditions, different leaders,'' said Ms. Telen. ''She understood it. It hurt her of course, but I never heard her be mean or bitter about it.''         As a couple, the Gorbachevs shared interests in philosophy and literature, theater and politics. Mr. Gorbachev on several occasions acknowledged that he often turned to his wife for advice. In his book, he recalled how the two would have their most serious discussions in the garden of their Government-provided apartment, beyond the earshot of K.G.B. eavesdropping devices.         Their close relationship was the envy of their friends. At a dinner in Paris in the fall of 1985, her host said she confided: ''I am very lucky with Mikhail. We are really friends, or if you prefer, we have great complicity.''         After the collapse of the Soviet Union in December 1991, when Mr. Yeltsin took over Mr. Gorbachev's office in the Kremlin, he became a political pariah in Russia, widely blamed for ushering in reforms that led to a decade of political and economic instability.         After a disastrous run for the presidency in 1996, he maintained a low profile at home, while Mrs. Gorbachev, who accompanied him on the international lecture circuit, became practically invisible until her recent illness.         With a diagnosis of acute lukemia, Mrs. Gorbachev was rushed to the hospital in Munster on July 25. News of her hospitalization became public only in early August.         According to Russian news reports, Mr. Gorbachev remained at her side day and night. ''Dear God,'' the former Soviet President, visibly exhausted, told a Russian television reporter on Aug. 9, ''for her to undergo such a drama these two days before my very eyes.''       
         Mignon Garland, a dancer and teacher who played a major role in keeping Isadora Duncan's legacy alive in the United States, died on Sept. 15 at her home in San Pablo, Calif. She was 91.         After Duncan's death in 1927, her repertory and ideas as a pioneer of modern dance were passed directly to Ms. Garland and other disciples by the pupils Duncan had trained in Germany and called her adopted daughters. Two of them, Anna Duncan and Irma Duncan, were Ms. Garland's teachers in New York.         She, in turn, taught many of the fourth- and fifth-generation Duncan dancers performing today, including her granddaughter, Amy Baird Garlin, and Lori Belilove, well known for her concerts in New York.         As founder and director of the Isadora Duncan Heritage Society, Miss Garland was often consulted by scholars and performers.         Miss Garland, born in Brooklyn, studied ballet and other forms of dance as a child and was 13 when she performed at Town Hall. After seeing a performance by Anna Duncan in 1927, she decided to devote her life to Duncan dancing.         In 1930, she toured internationally with the Minneapolis Symphony as a member of Irma Duncan's company. After a United States tour, the pupils of the Russian school founded by Duncan invited Ms. Garland to study and dance with them in Moscow in 1931.         After her return in 1933, Miss Garland helped found the New Duncan Dancers and was dance editor of New Theater magazine. In 1942 she formed the Contemporary Duncan Dancers with two other prominent Duncan disciples, Hortense Kooluris and Julia Levien. The group performed at Carnegie Hall in 1944 with the National Symphony Orchestra conducted by Leon Barzin. In 1952 the original members of Irma Duncan Dancers marked the 25th anniversary of Duncan's death with a concert at Carnegie Recital Hall.         Interest in Isadora Duncan's legend remained alive, but performances of her works became infrequent after the 1950's until Miss Garland helped promote the current Duncan revival that began with the 1977 centenary of the dance pioneer's birth.         After moving to Berkeley, Calif., in 1957, Miss Garland lived for many years in San Francisco at 501 Taylor Street, the site of Duncan's birth, which Miss Garland marked with a bronze plaque in 1973 at a ceremony attended by Irma Duncan.         In 1977, Mayor George Moscone proclaimed May 26 as Isadora Duncan Centenary Day, and Miss Garland's company, the San Francisco Duncan Dancers, performed in Colonial Concert Hall. In 1988 Miss Garland succeeded in having a street renamed Isadora Duncan Lane.         Miss Garland was also trained as an elementary school teacher at the Maxwell Training School in Brooklyn and like her parents, she was active in social and political causes. Her mother, Rose Heiman Halpern, helped Margaret Sanger open a birth control clinic in Brooklyn in 1916; her father, William Halpern, was defeated as a candidate for the New York State Assembly. Ms. Garland was denied a permanent teaching license in New York City. According to her son, Victor Garlin, the reason was ''her political organizing for improved schools in Harlem.''         After moving to California, Miss Garland taught Duncan's dancing under the auspices of the San Francisco Art Commission Neighborhood Arts Program and in private schools. She opened her own studio in 1973 and gave her last major recital with her students in 1989.         In addition to her son, of Berkeley, she is survived by a sister, Paula H. Gould of New York, and two granddaughters.       
         Sigrid de Lima, a writer whose early works won praise but who withdrew from public life in midcareer, died on Sunday at a hospital in Nyack, N.Y. She was 77 and lived in Valley Cottage, N.Y.         The cause was a stroke, said her daughter, Alison de Lima Greene.         Ms. de Lima burst upon the New York literary scene in 1950 with ''Captain's Beach,'' the first published novel to come out of the editor Hiram Haydn's prestigious workshop at the New School for Social Research. The tale of a handful of threadbare survivors in a shabby rooming house on the New York waterfront, the book met with mixed reviews with critics simultaneously proclaiming Ms. de Lima the next Hemingway, Dostoyevsky or Woolf, or calling her writing ''painfully studied and even windy.''         Ms. de Lima fared better with her second work, ''The Swift Cloud'' (1952), about the murder of a disabled child in a California town. The book was well received.         Her slim body of work won her a Prix de Rome in 1953, with a fellowship in literature at the American Academy of Arts and Letters in Rome. There she met and married a fellow winner, Stephen Greene, an artist.         With her ''Carnival by the Sea'' (1954), described in The Times as ''the moving story of a lovely lost Eurydice, wandering in the gaudy hell of a modern amusement park,'' critics were generally agreed on her considerable skills. After only two more works, ''Praise a Fine Day'' in 1959 and ''Oriane'' in 1968, both of which met with acclaim, Ms. de Lima ceased writing for publication, preferring instead to spend time with her family, Ms. Greene said.         In addition to her daughter, of Houston, she is survived by her husband.       
         Anneli Cahn Lax, a professor and editor who was a leader in the publishing of mathematical literature, died on Friday at her home on Manhattan's Upper West Side. She was 77.         Professor Lax had pancreatic cancer, said her husband, Peter Lax.         She retired in 1992 from New York University, where she had been a professor for 31 years after holding other posts there for 18 years.         In her dissertation at N.Y.U. and in later publications, she made significant contributions to the theory of hyperbolic equations, a complex mathematical theory about aspects of the behavior of many kinds of waves.         She may be best known, however,  for her contributions to the understanding of mathematics by both students and lay people, especially as the editor of the Mathematical Association of America's New Mathematical Library Series.         The series, started in 1961, included 36 published volumes by 1995. It was planned, by Professor Lax and others, to make mathematics accessible to the general reader without stinting on technical accuracy. Its first two books, ''Numbers: Rational and Irrational'' by Ivan Niven and ''What Is Calculus About?'' by W. W. Sawyer, are still in print after a third of a century.         In addition, Professor Lax ''led the way in changing mathematical pedagogy, in exploring the connections of mathematics to the larger curriculum, in understanding the interplay between language and mathematics,'' Joanne V. Creighton, president of Mount Holyoke College, said in awarding her an honorary degree in 1997.         President Creighton said Professor Lax's experiences in mathematics and family life had endowed her with a special awareness of the challenges confronting young women interested in mathematics.         Professor Lax was a longtime active member of the New York Academy of Sciences and was instrumental in shaping its program of science education for children.         ''There is a misconception among people and schoolchildren about the nature of mathematics,'' she said in a 1979 interview. ''They consider it a matter of rules and regulations instead of thinking.'' The pressure, she said, was for pupils to come up with the right answer quickly, without time to analyze.         The honors she won included an award for ''distinguished service to mathematics'' from the mathematical association.         Professor Lax was born in Kattowitz, Germany. She and her family fled Hitler's Germany in 1935 and settled in New York. She received a bachelor's degree in 1942 from Adelphi College and her doctorate in 1956.         Besides her husband of 51 years, who is also a professor of mathematics at N.Y.U., she is survived by a son, Dr. James D. Lax of Manhattan,  and three grandsons.       
         Jessie Lee Brown Foveaux, who sold her first book for $1 million when she was 98, died on Saturday in a hospital in Duluth, Minn., where she was vacationing with her daughter. She was 100.         Miss (her preference) Foveaux (pronounced FOH-voh), a snowy-haired great-great-grandmother, lived a literary fairy tale when she turned a memoir she wrote in a writing class for senior citizens in her hometown, Manhattan, Kan., into the book ''Any Given Day.''         In a 1997 auction Warner Books paid $1 million for the rights to publish the book.         In its 208 pages, she told of the quietly heroic struggle of a woman to win her independence while she was in a bitter marriage to an alcoholic. She worked in a laundry and as a nurse's aid to support her eight children before and after the divorce.         Her book, never intended for publication, ''just poured out,'' said Charley Kempthorne, a part-time farmer who taught a writing class at the Manhattan Adult Learning Center. ''She had bottled it up for many, many years.''         Miss Foveaux was an unschooled and unskilled writer, but she was clearly a born storyteller. Her words were straightforward. Of her decision to divorce, she wrote, ''I made up my mind to live my life so that I need not be ashamed to look at myself in a mirror.''         The book, which she began in 1977 and took several years to write, came to light only after an article about it appeared in 1997 on the front page of The Wall Street Journal to which Mr. Kempthorne had sent a copy. The article set off a frenzy to buy the book, leading to the auction.         The editor who acquired it, Claire Zion, called the writing ''very plain, very clear,'' and said that it would be altered only insignificantly for publication. ''We in New York try to sit here and think what the country is thinking,'' she said. ''This is Kansas talking.''         The book auction and the publicity visit to New York transported her to a new world. Miss Foveaux flew for the first time, took limousines, stayed at fancy hotels, appeared on talk shows and was written about in newspapers. She took it all with a big grain of salt.         ''I imagine I'll be like everyone else that ever got into a mess like this,'' she said.         The book was published in 1997 and remains in print but was not a best seller, despite the wide pre-publication publicity it received.         Miss Foveaux was born in Holden, Mo., in 1899, at a time when the world of Mark Twain was fading into memory. Her early childhood was spent on a small Missouri farm, but then her family moved frequently, to Arkansas and Washington State, among other places. As World War I started, she got her first job and fell in love with a young soldier. He vanished in the war, her beloved mother died, and the Depression wreaked hardship. She had eight children. As her book related, she struggled to maintain them in difficult circumstances.         She is survived by two daughters, Faye Marie Rutledge of Winder, Ga., and Aleda Torgerson of Silver Bay, Minn., and a son, Marion, of Manhattan, Kan., as well as 16 grandchildren, 24 great-grandchildren and five great-great-grandchildren.         In an interview after the $1 million auction, she was asked if she would buy cars and houses for her relatives. She shot back, ''They didn't help me, did they?'' The article describes family members bursting into nervous laughter.       
         Linda F. Pezzano, a marketing consultant who helped what once was an obscure Canadian board game, Trivial Pursuit, achieve sales totaling more than $1 billion, died Tuesday at a hospice in Manhattan. She was 54.         She died of cervical cancer, said her brother David.         The Trivial Pursuit campaign designed by Ms. Pezzano changed the way game makers do business. Dorothy Crenshaw, who worked with Ms. Pezzano in marketing games and other products, said the approach was based on drumming up favorable word-of-mouth comments, or buzz.         For Trivial Pursuit, Ms. Pezzano sent 1,800 top buyers who would be attending the 1983 New York Toy Fair a series of teasing messages in the months before the event. She also sent the game to Hollywood stars whose names were mentioned in its trivia questions. When some stars, including Gregory Peck, James Mason, Pat Boone and Larry Hagman, wrote letters of thanks, she used them in her promotions.         She also staged game-playing events at parks, bars, restaurants and ski clubs to stimulate conversation.         One virtue of her campaign was that it was cheap. By giving away a few hundred games at a wholesale cost of $12 each, a fad was started.         ''She knew nobody would play a board game without getting their hands on it,'' said Chris Byrne, who in 1985 worked with Ms. Pezzano in selling the game Pictionary, a way of playing charades on paper. ''She took games to the people,'' said Mr. Byrne, who is now editor of Toy Report, an industry publication.         Mr. Byrne said her direct approach to potential players contrasted sharply with what was then the standard -- and expensive -- practice: relying on television, movies and licensing agreements.         ''She created the model that everyone now uses,'' he said. ''Today we call it 'viral marketing.' ''         Giving games away was a major part of the strategy, and she and Mr. Byrne would sometimes pass out free Pictionary games to every passenger on a flight they were on. ''We estimated that for every complete Pictionary we gave away, we sold between 5 and 12 more,'' he said.         Ms. Pezzano was born and raised in Schenectady. She came to Manhattan at 17 to become a folk singer. She attended Elmira College without obtaining an undergraduate degree but later earned a master's degree from Columbia Business School while working full time.         Besides her brother David of Schenectady, she is survived by another brother, Michael of Portland, Ore.         After a short stint with a public relations firm in the early 1980's she founded her own company, which took on Trivial Pursuit as one of its first projects. After her company was acquired by Dorf & Stanton in 1986, she moved to Italy, where she advised businesses on international ventures. In 1995, she returned to New York and started a new company, Pezzano Inc.         She continued to work on games, including a new sports trivia game called Rules of the Game. Among her ideas was to sell it in sporting goods stores rather than toy stores, where board games are traditionally sold.         ''You could go to Harvard Business School and learn how to do that,'' Mr. Byrne said, ''but to Linda it was always just common sense, and fun.''       
         Marilyn Silverstone, who left a career as a top photographer for the simple life of a Buddhist nun with the name Ngawang Chodron, died of cancer in a monastery near Katmandu last Tuesday, her sister Susan Darer said. She was 70.         She founded a nunnery several years ago near Katmandu, Nepal, one of the first Tibetan Buddhist nunneries outside of Tibet. It was a major step toward recapturing women's traditionally strong role in Tibetan Buddhism, said Gene Smith, a Boston-based publisher of Buddhist books. Ms. Silverstone worked for the photo agency Magnum -- photographing subjects from Albert Schweitzer to the coronation of the Shah of Iran -- but her last years were spent establishing the nunnery.         ''She was very interested in helping other women,'' said Jean Thies, a Buddhist living in Manhattan who has a business importing Tibetan Buddhist goods into the United States. Ms. Thies and others said this was a response to a diminished religious role for women in the Buddhist communities in exile from Tibet. Mr. Smith said, ''Women had come to be regarded as just handmaidens to the clergy.''         Ms. Silverstone's personal transformation, from a stylish photographer in Dior suits to a nun with a shaved head and running shoes dyed purple to go with her maroon robes, struck friends and colleagues as remarkable. As for herself, she saw the personal journey to her ultimate Buddhist identity, Ngawang Chodron, as essentially inevitable.         ''The only way to make my inside match my outside was to become a nun,'' she wrote.         Ms. Silverstone was born on March 9, 1929, in London, grew up in Scarsdale and graduated from Wellesley College in 1950. Her father was a movie executive who worked with Charlie Chaplin and other early movie stars; her mother, late in life, decided to get an education and graduated from college at 80.         Ms. Silverstone's first jobs were with art and design magazines, including Art News. In 1955, she became a freelance photographer. She went to India on an assignment to photograph Ravi Shankar in 1956 and fell in love with Frank Moraes, then editor of The Indian Express. They lived together until 1974, socializing in an elite set of politicians, journalists and intellectuals.         Her reputation as a photographer grew, and in 1967 she became a full member of Magnum, which is organized as a photographer-owned cooperative. She covered such big events as the arrival of the Dalai Lama in India, but it was the insights into Indian life, particularly in the villages, that she most cherished.         One famous image showed an Indian princess sitting shyly in sunglasses surrounded by 265 tigers her husband had shot. Ms. Silverstone avoided ''poverty pictures,'' calling them an Indian cliche.         Increasingly, she came to see taking pictures as predatory, once suggesting that subjects become ''like pieces of meat.'' But she readily admitted that she herself would often choose the most abject case in a line of poor children to make her journalistic point. ''You find you are getting glib with your hands,'' she said.         So she was ready to complete a journey that had begun when, as a child suffering from the mumps, she picked up ''Secret Tibet'' by Fosco Maraini. She said the book provided a key she long carried in her subconscious, the mysticism of Tibet. Mr. Moraes died in 1974 and she became a nun in 1977.         In 1987, she was fully ordained in a ceremony in Hong Kong.         Friends say she exhibited a hearty sense of humor, one laced with American Jewish expressions. She wrote several books, including several children's books published in the 1960's. In 1985, she published ''Ocean of Life: Visions of India and Himalayan Kingdoms.'' Just before her death, she finished translating a book by an 18th-century female lama into English.         Besides Ms. Darer, she is survived by another sister, Barbara S. Garrison.         Starting on Nov. 5, the work of five Magnum photojournalists, including Ms. Silverstone, will be exhibited at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh. In a biography of her, one of the other photographers, Eva Arnold, quoted Ms. Silverstone summing up her life.         ''I can say that I did it all,'' Ms. Silverstone was quoted as saying. ''The secret though is just keep walking through life without analyzing it too much or clinging to it too much. Just walk on.''         Correction:  October 6, 1999, Wednesday  An obituary of the photographer and Buddhist nun Marilyn Silverstone on Monday misstated the given name of a photojournalist whose work, along with hers and others', will be exhibited at the Scottish National Portrait Gallery in Edinburgh beginning Nov. 5. The photojournalist is Eve Arnold, not Eva.       
         Dr. Naomi Bluestone, a medical writer, a practitioner, a teacher and a ''Dear Abby'' to a generation of aspiring doctors, died Nov. 13 at her home in Center Barnstead, N.H. She was 63 and had moved there from Great Neck, N.Y., in 1991.         The cause was chronic lymphocytic leukemia, said her husband, Robert Press.         Dr. Bluestone wrote about 200 articles in professional as well as lay journals. She wrote a book, ''So You Want to Be a Doctor?'' (William Morrow, 1981), for college students contemplating medical careers and fielded the question with humor and satire.         Her main interests were in social and public health and psychiatry, and she continued to write about them to the end. Until two years ago, her general psychiatric practice in Center Barnstead drew patients from near and far.         Born in Wilmington, Del., she graduated from the University of Delaware with an English major. Changing course, she graduated from Women's Medical College of Pennsylvania in 1962 and trained in psychiatry in New York in the 1980's.         In between, Dr. Bluestone held teaching and administrative posts in New York at Mount Sinai Hospital, Bird S. Coler Memorial Hospital and Montefiore Hospital. She was also  the city's assistant commissioner of health for chronic and long-term care in the 1970's.         She wrote on many issues confronting American medicine, particularly those affecting women as doctors and patients. Dr. Bluestone also helped organize national conferences and seminars on the challenges for female doctors and the special problems of female patients.         She wrote columns for such publications as The New Physician, Medical Dimensions and Resident and Staff Physician. As an editor she was associated with The New York State Journal of Medicine and The Journal of Community Health.         ''I was getting letters from medical students,'' Dr. Bluestone said in an interview after her book was published, ''and the medical students would pour their hearts out to me to the point where I was starting to feel like the Dear Abby of the medical profession.''         She said some asked advice about the dictatorial atmosphere of hospitals and the terror and loneliness of internship, adding, ''The women, in particular, wrote to me about sexism, discrimination, problems juggling career, home, family, husband.''       
         Regina Shoolman Slatkin, a dealer in old master drawings and a writer and specialist on the 18th-century French painter Francois Boucher, died on Thursday at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 92 and had homes in Manhattan, Essex, N.Y., and Palm Beach, Fla.         Born in what was Austria-Hungary and reared in Quebec, Mrs. Slatkin graduated from McGill University. She went to Paris on a French government fellowship to study at the Sorbonne and the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, and became interested in French art. She also studied at the University of Chicago.         When she returned to Canada she worked as a journalist on The Montreal Star and for the Jewish Welfare Board. She also published poetry and collaborated with the ethnologist Marius Barbeau on a government-sponsored project, later made into a book, to collect and translate the folk songs of Quebec.         In 1936 she married Charles E. Slatkin, a New York schoolteacher, and moved to Manhattan. Mr. Slatkin worked as a liaison between the public schools and the city museums from an office at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Mrs. Slatkin worked as an editor and for several years as executive director of the Iranian Institute of Art and Archaeology.         In 1959 the couple opened a gallery in their apartment on East 92nd Street that specialized in old master drawings and Impressionist painting and sculpture. Their exhibitions were often accompanied by scholarly publications, like the 1962 show of Rodin's sculptures and watercolors whose catalog included essays by Leo Steinberg and Albert Elsen.         Mrs. Slatkin, who published numerous articles on Boucher in Burlington magazine and other journals, was instrumental in organizing the National Gallery of Art's 1974 exhibition of Boucher drawings, the first major show of its kind in North America, for which she wrote the catalog introduction and entries. With her husband she wrote ''The Enjoyment of Art in America'' (1947) and ''Six Centuries of French Master Drawings in America'' (1950). Her last article, ''A Note on a Boucher Drawing,'' was written and published in Master Drawings magazine in 1996.         After her husband's death in 1977 Mrs. Slatkin became interested in the decorative arts, building a collection of early-American glass that she donated to the State University of New York at Plattsburgh. She also donated 19th- and 20th-century prints.         Mrs. Slatkin is survived by two daughters, Carole Slatkin of Plattsburgh and Laura Slatkin of Chicago.       
         Phoebe Snetsinger, who saw and recorded more birds than anybody else, died on Nov. 23 in a van accident on a birding expedition to Madagascar, shortly after viewing an exceptionally rare Helmet vanga. She was 68 and lived in Webster Groves, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis.         Birding went from a hobby to a passion for Mrs. Snetsinger on the day in 1981 that a doctor told her she had an incurable cancer, with less than a year to live. Rejecting therapy, she took off to Alaska on a scheduled trip, her first long-distance journey simply to see birds.         ''She came back and felt good,'' her husband, David, said. ''Things just started snowballing from there.''         Mrs. Snetsinger liked to say her avian ardor ''began with a death sentence,'' and her relentless energy reflected that level of urgency as her cancer went into the first of several remissions. Family members and friends could not imagine her without binoculars, floppy hat, sneakers, telescope and other field gear as she scurried around the globe on scores of bird tours, most costing more than $5,000. An inheritance paid the bills; she supplied the boundless energy. She said she spent more time in the world's jungles, mountains and other wild areas than at home.         There were setbacks, as the cancer, melanoma, recurred every five years or so, only to go into remission again. But her record, as verified by the American Birding Association, was sighting about 8,400 birds, or nearly 85 percent of the species now estimated to exist, more than 2,000 birds ahead of her nearest competitor.         ''She was a celebrity in our bunch,'' said Bret Whitney, a co-founder of Field Guides, a tour operator based in Austin, Tex. Mrs. Snetsinger was traveling on one of the group's tours when the van overturned. Mr. Whitney said she apparently died instantly.         ''She gave so much to the birding world and had so much more left to give,'' said G. Stuart Keith, the birding association's first president. At the highest tier of birding, it was a common joke to differentiate between Phoebe Snetsinger and the phoebe, a genus of flycatchers.         Genera, or large groups of species (as in the genus Homo of Homo sapiens), were of considerable importance to Mrs. Snetsinger, who kept a separate list of those that have only a single species, known as monotypic genera. Her list of more than 2,000 such genera far surpassed anyone else's, said Mr. Whitney, who also works as a research associate at Louisiana State University.         She also kept extensive notes on subspecies, using index cards as a catalog until switching in recent months to a computer from the Remington portable typewriter she had used since college.         Her subspecies notes, in whatever format, are important because many of the birds have now been reclassified as species. When she started, there were 8,500 officially named species, compared with about 10,000 now. A spokeswoman for the American Museum of Natural History said some scientists believed there could eventually be as many as 18,000 named separate bird species.         This means that her life list will almost certainly grow posthumously. ''She has birds in escrow,'' Mr. Whitney said.         Mrs. Snetsinger was born in Lake Zurich, Ill., where she attended a one-room elementary school with only two other students. At 11, she met her future husband, then 13, in 4-H clubs.         She graduated from Swarthmore College as a German major, and then taught science at the Baldwin School, a private girls school in Bryn Mawr, Pa. When Mr. Snetsinger returned from service in Korea, they both attended graduate school and she earned a master's degree in German literature.         They had four children, all of whom survive. They are Thomas, of Corvallis, Ore.; Penny, of Woodbridge, Conn.; Carol, of Missoula, Mont., and Susan, of Tempe, Ariz. All but Penny pursued careers relating to birds, Thomas as a researcher in endangered bird species for the Federal government, Carol as a bird researcher in Alaska and Montana, and Susan as a student of the spotted owl in the Northwest.         In 1965, a friend took Mrs. Snetsinger birding for the first time in Minnesota, and when her husband took a corporate job in Missouri she pursued her interest with a group of birders. (Birders adamantly spurn the term ''birdwatcher'' in the belief that it suggests a lack of gravity.) The group visited local woods and prairies each Thursday afternoon.         After birding came to represent a new lease on life to her, Mrs. Snetsinger began to take longer and longer trips. She was hooked when she visited Kenya and saw 500 different birds in three weeks. Her odyssey was aided by new technology for recording bird sounds, greater access to more and more remote habitats and the increasing numbers of tours being offered.         The depth of her enthusiasm is suggested by her response to a fall she took about six months ago while climbing a mountain in the Philippines: she stayed in the field for two additional weeks to see more birds.         The whole idea of listing birds, or at least the seriousness of the pursuit, is also sometimes criticized, or at least satirized. Indeed, it is called ''the game'' by birders themselves. ''It's like collecting stamps or baseball cards,'' said Paul J. Baicich, editor of Birding, the magazine of the American Birding Association.         Mr. Snetsinger said his wife's competitive spirit was kept hidden, though he did not deny it existed. In a 1996 interview, she insisted that she wanted to play down her quantitative quest. ''I'm going back to being a birder, not a lister,'' she said.         Ultimately, she felt very lucky, as she explained in an article to be published in next February's issue of Birding. ''Birding is the best and most exciting pursuit in the world, a glorified never-ending one,'' Mrs. Snetsinger wrote. ''And the whole experience of a foreign trip, whether you see 10 new birds or 500, is simply too good to miss.''       
         Faith Sale, a publishing executive and the editor of dozens of novels and short-story collections by such authors as Donald Barthelme, Kurt Vonnegut, Joseph Heller, Kaye Gibbons and Amy Tan, died on Wednesday at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 63 and had homes in Greenwich Village and Cold Spring, N.Y.         The cause was cancer, said her husband, the historian and biographer Kirkpatrick Sale.         Known as a devoted writers' advocate and a hands-on editor of a decidedly literary bent, Ms. Sale had a career in publishing that spanned four decades, beginning at J. B. Lippincott and including stints at Macmillan and E. P. Dutton. She spent the last 20 years at G. P. Putnam's Sons, where she was vice president and senior executive editor and is said to have introduced a more literary sensibility.         Her titles there included Mr. Heller's fictional treatment of the life of Rembrandt, ''Picture This'' (1988);  Ms. Tan's breakthrough novel, ''The Joy Luck Club'' (1989); and Mr. Barthelme's collection ''60 Stories'' (1981), which won the PEN/Faulkner fiction award. Most recently she edited Mr. Vonnegut's collection of stories from the 1950's, ''Bagombo Snuff Box,'' which was published in September, and a new novel by Delia Ephron, ''Big City Eyes,'' to be published in March.         Born Faith Apfelbaum in New York in 1936, she grew up in Manhattan and in New Rochelle, N.Y., and attended Cornell University, where she came under the thrall of an authoritative English professor named William M. Sale Jr. She worked on the school newspaper with his son, Kirk, whom she would marry.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Rebekah Sale and Kalista Sale Parish, both of New York; a brother, Ben Apfelbaum of Atlanta; and a granddaughter.       
         Betty Cage, an administrator of the New York City Ballet who played a quiet but important role in creating the company, died on Sunday at New York-Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan. She was 82 and lived in Manhattan.         Her title for many years was simply general manager, but Ms. Cage was a linchpin of the City Ballet. She avoided the limelight and was unknown to the balletgoing public. A woman of few words, she presided over generations of dancers, choreographers and backstage personnel with a wryly detached wit and a calm, almost uncanny sense of approaching trouble.         Ms. Cage was, as Lincoln Kirstein, co-founder of the City Ballet, described her role in ''Thirty Years,'' his history of the organization, ''at once labor negotiator, certified public accountant, legal expert, mother superior, confessor, psychiatrist and practicing witch (white magic).'' She was, Kirstein wrote, ''proficient in the science and pursuit of the possible and impossible.''         Born in Minneapolis, Ms. Cage grew up in Buffalo, then moved to New York. She worked in a law office before becoming an assistant editor at John Bernard Myers's literary journal View and an assistant to Frances Steloff at the Gotham Book Mart, jobs that gained her entry into the world of New York poets, artists and intellectuals involved in dance in the 1940's.         It is likely that Kirstein met Ms. Cage at the Gotham Book Mart, where he is said to have invited her to work with Ballet Society, a precursor to City Ballet. Ms. Cage arrived in 1947 and retired in 1985. Her first job there was as an assistant to Frances Hawkins, the business manager at Ballet Society. It was there that Ms. Cage formed a close professional relationship with Morton Baum, who, as chairman of the City Center's finance committee in 1948, extended a crucial invitation to the ballet company to become a resident of the theater. Ms. Cage also helped to engineer the City Ballet's 1964 move to Lincoln Center. In 1985, she founded the Dancers Emergency Fund at City Ballet.         Ms. Cage was an avid practitioner  of tai chi, the Chinese system of movement. She collaborated with her husband, Edward Maisel, on ''Tai Chi for Health,'' published in 1972. Ms. Cage also taught unofficial tai chi classes at the City Ballet-affiliated School of American Ballet.         She is survived by her husband.       
         Margaret A. Greenfield, a founder and officer of the Independent Journalism Foundation and a dealer in art, antiques and real estate, died yesterday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 74.         She had cancer, said her husband, James L. Greenfield.         Beginning in the 1950's, Mrs. Greenfield was an art and antiques dealer in London, Washington and finally Manhattan, where for about the last 25 years she owned and ran an antiques shop, Marco Polo, on Madison Avenue between 84th and 85th Streets. It closed about a year ago.         She also renovated and resold brownstones on the Upper East Side.         Mrs. Greenfield was active in the Independent Journalism Foundation from its inception in 1991. The foundation, based in Manhattan, teaches citizens of former Communist countries in Central and Eastern Europe about working as journalists in newly democratic societies.         She was the foundation's treasurer and one of its founders, along with her husband and Donald M. Wilson, a former vice president of Time Inc. Mr. Greenfield, a former foreign correspondent for Time magazine and former assistant secretary of state, is now a consulting member of the editorial board at The New York Times, where he has also been foreign editor and later an assistant managing editor.         Mrs. Greenfield created and furnished the foundation's four centers in Eastern European capitals -- in Prague, Bratislava, Bucharest and Budapest.         Margaret Ann Schwertley Greenfield was born in Gooding, Idaho. She received a bachelor's degree from the University of Idaho and worked as a stewardess for United Airlines and then for Pan American World Airways.         She met Mr. Greenfield when she was based in Hong Kong in the early 1950's, while she was Pan Am's first stewardess based in the Far East. They were married in 1954.         Besides her husband, she is survived by two sisters, Anne Schwertley of Manhattan and Jane Schwertley of Gainesville, Fla.       
         Elizabeth Zimmermann, who brought a penetrating intellect and a sculptor's sensitivity to revolutionizing the ancient art of knitting, died Nov. 30 at a hospital in Marshfield, Wis., where she lived. She was 89.         Mrs. Zimmermann's best-known gift to knitting was a mathematical formula for figuring the proportions of sweaters and other garments, depending on how many stitches per inch the knitter wanted to use. But her passion, expressed in magazine columns, in four books and at her knitting camp, the nation's first, was creating beauty. She gently urged knitters to challenge the limits of their imaginations.         ''She allowed people to be intuitive about their knitting, rather than just being blind followers of the written word,'' said Nancy J. Thomas, editor of Knitter's Magazine. ''She had a way of being breezy and fun. She made everything seem easy.''         Linda Ligon, president of Interweave Press, which specializes in traditional textile crafts, said Mrs. Zimmermann ''brought intelligence and validity to a craft that had been trivialized as women's work.''         Elizabeth Lloyd-Jones was born near Devon, England, in 1910, the daughter of a naval officer and the woman who invented Meals by Motor, a British forerunner of Meals on Wheels. Her youthful memories, as recalled in ''Knitting Around'' (Schoolhouse Press, 1989), suggested a bucolic paradise, framed by plum trees and plum jam, governesses and private schools.         ''I had a wonderful hideyhole in a gone-to-seed cabbage patch,'' Mrs. Zimmermann said, ''and one day had the excitement and glory of falling through the roof of an abandoned chicken house, garnering the first permanent scar on my leg.''         The women of her mother's family knitted. One day, she asked her mother if she could try knitting, perhaps the most important words she ever uttered.         ''If you're good all day today, I'll teach you tomorrow,'' her mother answered.         Miss Lloyd-Jones attended art schools in Lausanne, Switzerland, and Munich, where she sold sweaters of her own design to a local shop for pocket money. She also met Arnold Zimmermann, a brewer. He had to flee Hitler's Germany because an SS agent overheard him making a snide remark about Hitler. They married in England, immigrated to New York and moved several times before settling in Wisconsin.         Mrs. Zimmermann began spending morning after morning with local knitters, exchanging tips. She became frustrated with many of her friends' lockstep reliance on precise instructions in printed patterns. So, in 1955, she submitted her designs for Norwegian-pattern sweaters to Woman's Day magazine, resolving to use clear language. Other magazines also accepted her designs, and in 1959, she started her own knitting publication.         About the same time, the family, with three children, moved into a derelict schoolhouse in the middle of the woods and remodeled it. She combined her newsletter with a mail-order business for knitting supplies, books and video productions under the name Schoolhouse Press.         She was hostess of a knitting program shown on many public television stations and in 1974 began a knitting camp under the auspices of the University of Wisconsin. The camp has continued every summer since. She also led workshops throughout the United States and in New Zealand.         Besides ''Knitting Around,'' her books included ''Knitting Without Tears'' (Scribner's/Macmillan, 1971), Knitter's Almanac (Scribner's/Dover, 1975) and ''Knitting Workshop'' (Schoolhouse Press, 1981).         She was a woman who held to strong principles about her work, like never using any thread but wool. But she never criticized another knitter's use of other materials, including the dreaded polyester. She developed a reputation for giving pithy advice.         ''A knitter's question which arises perennially,'' she wrote in Knitter's Almanac, ''is, 'How much wool should I buy?' ''         She said there was no blanket answer, but advised, ''If you are using very thick wool, buy more than you could possibly imagine; if you are using very thin wool, use surprisingly little.''         But Mrs. Zimmermann's larger influence was in design, making sweaters and other garments in round tubes, rather than in flat pieces to be joined together. The result was a sculptural quality, said her daughter Meg Swansen, who is also a noted knitter and will carry on her mother's business. By contrast, Kaffe Fassett, a knitter whose work is often exhibited in art galleries, is known for his painterly approach, she said.         But Ms. Ligon said sculptural effects were just the beginning. She said Mrs. Zimmermann's mathematical formula for constructing sweaters in the round freed knitters to concentrate on other creative concerns, like yarn and stitches.         ''She was more than a sculptor,'' Ms. Ligon said. ''She was an engineer.''         Many knitters said the system opened up new possibilities to them.  ''She made me a thinking knitter,'' said Joyce Williams of Sparta, Wis., who attended three knitting camps with Mrs. Zimmermann.         A woman from Reading, Mass., in an online customer review of ''Knitting Without Tears'' on Amazon.com, said: ''Elizabeth's wonderful instructions, comments and faith gave me the O.K. to go ahead and have fun. I made a patterned yoke sweater that not only looks great, but fits as well.''         In addition to Ms. Swansen, who lives in Pittsville, Wis., Mrs. Zimmermann is survived by her husband, Arnold; another daughter, Lloie, of Pittsville; a son, Thomas, of New Hope, Pa.; two grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter.         Mrs. Zimmermann chose to play down her influence on knitting, coining the term ''unventions'' for her woolly inventions.         ''The products of science and technology may be new, and some of them are quite horrid, but knitting?'' she wrote in Knitter's Almanac. ''In knitting there are ancient possibilities; the earth is enriched with the dust of millions of knitters who have held wool and needles since the beginning of sheep.''
