Miss Hutton sang with the Miller band from 1939 until the band leader joined the United States Army Air Corps in World War II.
She took time out from her career in 1919 to be the wife, briefly, of Count Eugene Dambski, a Polish army career officer, then returned to Berlin to make films.
She also held posts in other civic and political organizations, including the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People; the National Democratic Committee; the Salvation Army Advisory Committee, and St. Mary's Hospital.
Miss Mills, who was born in Stamford, Conn., was an Army Nurse and a ''farmerette,'' a member of a corps of young women working on farms, in World War I.
