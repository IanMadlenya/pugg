         Anne Morrow Lindbergh, the lyrical author and aviator whose marriage to Charles A. Lindbergh brought her both joy and tragedy, died yesterday at her home in Passumpsic, Vt. She was 94.         Their daughter Reeve Lindbergh wrote in her 1998 memoir ''Under a Wing'' (Simon & Schuster) that her mother had suffered adverse effects from her advancing age and from strokes and was ''often confused in her mind, and in fragile health.''         Anne Morrow Lindbergh scored an immense literary success in midlife with her 1955 book ''Gift From the Sea'' ( Pantheon), which was a philosophical meditation on women's lives in this century. It was on the nonfiction best-seller list of The New York Times for 80 weeks and was No. 1 for 47 of those weeks. In the book's first 20 years in print, more than five million copies were sold in hard-cover and paperback editions.         Mrs. Lindbergh was the author of more than two dozen books of prose and poetry, including five volumes of diaries; her work was often acclaimed by critics and popular with readers. Despite the literary distinction that she achieved, her life was largely shaped by two dramatic experiences when she was in her 20's. One was blissful, one was anguished. They were reflected in the title of a volume of her diaries: ''Hour of Gold, Hour of Lead'' (1973, Harcourt, Brace).         The first experience came in 1927 when Anne Morrow, then a 21-year-old senior at Smith College, arrived for the Christmas holidays in Mexico City, where her well-to-do father, Dwight W. Morrow, was the American ambassador.         'He Is Taller Than Anyone Else'         There she met Charles Lindbergh, whose courageous solo flight across the Atlantic had made him a hero of mythic proportions and the most famous man in the world. He was staying with her family, and the sight of the boyish aviator tugged at her heartstrings.         ''He is taller than anyone else,'' she wrote in her diary. ''You see his head in a moving crowd, and you notice his glance, where it turns, as though it were keener, clearer and brighter than anyone else's, lit with a more intense fire. What could I say to this boy? Anything I might say would be trivial and superficial, like pink frosting flowers. I felt the whole world before this to be frivolous, superficial, ephemeral.''         Two years later the man known as Lucky Lindy married the shy, literary Miss Morrow. The glamorous Lindberghs were seldom out of the news as they made pioneering flights to Latin America and Asia, becoming ''the First Couple of the Skies.'' As the critic Alfred Kazin observed, ''To millions around the world -- reading of the Lindberghs flying everywhere in their own Lockheed Sirius seaplane, looking at photographs of the 'perfect'-looking couple ('the Lone Eagle and his mate') landing in Siberia, China, Japan -- the Lindberghs seemed to enjoy the greatest possible good fortune that a young couple could have.''         But that second experience came four years later, on the evening of March 1, 1932, in Hopewell, N.J., where the Lindberghs were at home with their 20-month-old son, Charles Jr., and a nurse, Betty Gow. The nurse looked in now and then on Charlie as he slept in his crib.         ''At 10 Betty went in to the baby, shut the window, then lit the electric stove, then turned to the bed; it was empty, and the sides still up,'' Mrs. Lindbergh wrote later in a letter to her mother-in-law. At first Miss Gow  thought Lindbergh had taken his son from the crib for a joke, Mrs. Lindbergh continued, adding poignantly, ''I did, until I saw his face.'' Lindbergh, looking down at his diminutive wife, said, ''Anne, they have stolen our baby.''         The Lindberghs were soon enveloped in the horror of the kidnapping, the discovery of the child's body on May 12, more than 10 weeks later, and the subsequent arrest, trial, conviction and execution of Bruno Richard Hauptmann, a carpenter, for Charlie's murder in 1936.         They had always been ''intensely private persons with an austere, restrained, glowingly creative sense of life,'' Mr. Kazin wrote. Both had a fear of crowds and nothing, even Lindbergh's 1927 landing in Paris, had prepared them for the carnival of reporters, photographers, con artists, curiosity-seekers, vandals and  crazy people who had invaded their lives after their baby was kidnapped. Americans would not experience a similar flood of publicity until the O. J. Simpson murder trial of the 1990's.         The Literary Career She Always Wanted         Mrs. Lindbergh would never get over her child's death but she went on to bear five more children and to have the literary career she had dreamed of. The historian Geoffrey C. Ward wrote in 1998 that '''Gift From the Sea' became a source of inspiration for a whole generation of wives and mothers -- 'the great vacationless class,' she called them -- who, like herself, were beginning to search for more fulfilling lives once their children had grown and moved away.''         Mrs. Lindbergh echoed many women's concerns with observations like this: ''What a circus act we women perform every day of our lives. Look at us. We run a tightrope daily, balancing a pile of books on the head. Baby-carriage, parasol, kitchen chair, still under control. Steady now! This is not the life of simplicity but the life of multiplicity that the wise men warn us of. It leads not to unification but to fragmentation. It does not bring grace; it destroys the soul.''         Lewis Gannett wrote that her 1938 best seller, ''Listen! The Wind,'' had ''caught the poetry of flight in a web of words as no other book on flying has yet contrived to do.'' Alfred Kazin admired her as ''a lyricist of action.''         Millions of Americans respected  Mrs. Lindbergh,too. The readers of Good Housekeeping magazine voted her one of their 10 most admired women in 1975, when she was 69 and had a flock of grandchildren . This admiration was expressed over and over during her long life -- notably by letter-writers at the time of the kidnapping. And after the poet John Ciardi reviewed ''The Unicorn and Other Poems'' (Random House) in The Saturday Review and called her poetry ''inept, jingling, slovenly, illiterate,'' the magazine was soon rocked by what its editor, Norman Cousins, called ''the biggest storm of reader protest in our 33-year history'' -- most of it from Mrs. Lindbergh's female admirers.         The respect for Mrs. Lindbergh also survived bitter controversy over her 1940 book ''The Wave of the Future,'' a short, hazy manifesto, written while World War II raged in Europe. She wrote that she did not endorse communism or fascism, but that she saw them as inevitable effects of what she called the ''wave of the future.'' She also said she hoped the United States could avoid entering the conflict. And, in a letter, she wrote that she was beginning to feel that Hitler was ''a very great man, like an inspired religious leader -- and as such rather fanatical -- but not scheming, not selfish, not greedy for power.''         'Both Very Blind In the Beginning         ''The Wave of the Future'' was widely criticized when it appeared. Rabbi Abraham D. Shaw of Baltimore, for example, said in a speech in 1941 to a gathering of the Union of American of American Hebrew Congregations that it was the epitome of defeatism, and that in it Mrs. Lindbergh had counseled surrender to what he called the ''anti-religious, anti-ethical hordes.''         In later years, Walter S. Ross wrote in his 1967 biography ''The Last Hero: Charles A. Lindbergh'' that the book ''took so astral a view of the world that it made the crimes of the Nazis seem to bulk no larger than the inadequacies'' of the democracies.'' Some friends said they thought Mrs. Lindbergh had written the book at least partly to please her husband, who at that time was an ardent advocate of the United States' staying out of the war.         Mrs. Lindbergh herself later acknowledged that she and her husband had been ''both very blind, especially in the beginning, to the worst evils of the Nazi system.'' But she said that she had warned him that he would offend many Americans with an isolationist speech that he prepared to give in September 1941 in Des Moines, in which he warned Jews of retribution for being among the leading ''war agitators'' along with the British and the Roosevelt Administration. Reeve Lindbergh wrote in her book that years later her mother told her: ''If only he had listened to me. I told him what would happen if he listed 'interventionist' groups in that way . . . 'the British,' 'the Roosevelt Administration,' and 'the Jews.' I told him he would be called anti-Semitic.''         Mrs. Lindbergh recalled that he replied, ''But I'm not!'' and that she said: '' 'It doesn't matter. That's what will happen.' But he didn't believe me.''         When he gave the speech, he said: ''The leaders of both the British and Jewish races, for reasons which are understandable from their viewpoint as they are inadvisable from ours, for reasons which are not American, wish to involve us in the war. We cannot blame them for looking out for what they believe to be their own interests, but we also must look out for ours. We cannot allow the natural passions and prejudices of other peoples to lead our country to destruction.''         Later Mrs. Lindbergh wrote in her diary: ''He is attacked on all sides, Administration, pressure groups, and Jews, as now openly a Nazi, following a Nazi doctrine.''         In her diary volume called ''War Within and Without'' (1980), she said she experienced a ''profound feeling of grief'' over what her husband had said and decided it was ''at best unconsciously a bid for anti-Semitism. It is a match lit near a pile of excelsior.''         Some friends said that the above-the-battle stance that she evidenced in ''The Last Wave'' and in other writing -- her diaries during the mid-'30's made scant mention of the large political and social questions of the day -- was a reflection, in part, of her privileged, sheltered upbringing.         Anne Spencer Morrow was born on June 22, 1906, in Englewood, N.J. Her father became a multimillionaire partner in the banking house of J. P. Morgan & Company, who went on to become a Republican Senator from New Jersey. Her mother was Elizabeth Reeve Cutter Morrow, an educator and poet who was Smith College's acting president in 1939 and 1940 and who publicly criticized her daughter and son-in-law for their America First views.         Young Anne attended Miss Chapin's School in Manhattan, where her family maintained an apartment, and went on to Smith, where she won two literary prizes before she graduated in 1928. When she met Lindbergh, she was an intensely shy and romantic woman, only a bit over 5 feet tall, with grave blue eyes and a demure, schoolgirlish manner.         ''To be deeply in love is, of course, a great liberating force,'' she observed in the introduction to ''Hour of Gold, Hour of Lead.'' ''The sheer fact of finding myself loved was unbelievable and changed my world, my feelings about life and myself. I was given confidence, strength and almost a new character. The man I was to marry believed in me and what I could do, and consequently I found I could do more than I realized, even in that mysterious outer world that fascinated me but seemed unattainable. He opened the door to 'real life,' and though it frightened me, it also beckoned. I had to go.''         Mrs. Lindbergh wrote that before her marriage she had seen her husband-to-be more or less as ''a knight in shining armor, with myself as his devoted page.''         Was this a good basis for marriage? ''Hardly,'' she concluded. ''But it was a role I could play until I grew up. It was not a bad beginning.''         In 1929 the young couple were wed in a simple Protestant service in the drawing room of the Morrow family's hilltop manor in Englewood.  Just before the wedding began, Lindbergh strode out into the garden and picked a bouquet of larkspur and columbine for his bride to carry. Their marriage was the lead story on the front page of The New York Times and newspapers all over the world.         For their honeymoon the couple cruised to Maine in Lindbergh's motor launch, and the traveling continued in the first years of their marriage. Mrs. Lindbergh went with her husband, who was active in commercial aviation and scientific research, on many aerial journeys to Europe, to Asia, and to the Caribbean, where he was charting airplane routes.         She learned to navigate, to operate a radio, to pilot a plane. In 1930 she became the first woman to get a glider pilot's license in the United States. That same year she was co-pilot and navigator when her husband broke the transatlantic speed record. In 1934 she became the first woman to to receive the Hubbard Gold Medal of the National Geographic Society. Her first book, ''North to the Orient'' (Harcourt Brace), which became a best seller in 1935, was an account of one of their aerial voyages.         After living in a farmhouse in Princeton, the Lindberghs moved into a house that they had built on a 400-acre tract of land in the remote borough of Hopewell, near Trenton. It was there that their child was kidnapped. ''Everything is telescoped now into one moment, one of those eternal moments -- the moment when I realized that the baby had been taken,'' she wrote in her diary. In that ''first flash of horror,'' she wrote, she had seen in her mind's eye ''the baby dead, killed violently.''         ''Everything since then has been unreal,'' she continued. ''It has all vanished like smoke. Only that eternal moment remains. I feel strangely a sense of peace -- not peace, but an end to restlessness, a finality, as though I were sleeping in a grave.''         The hysteria and confusion attached to ''the Crime of the Century''  included weeks of negotiation with the kidnapper, the unavailing delivery of $50,000 in ransom money at a Bronx cemetery and many sensations and false leads. The baby's body was discovered in some nearby woods; he had been killed by a blow on the head soon after the kidnapping. Eventually, Mr. Hauptmann was traced through a banknote that had been part of the ransom. He was put on trial in Flemington, N.J., and Mrs. Lindbergh went on the witness stand for the prosecution to identify a flannel shirt -- made from an old petticoat of hers -- that had been found on the murdered baby. Tears brimmed in her eyes, but she never lost her composure.         After the trial, the Lindberghs tried to go on living in the United States, but there were threats on the life of their second child, a son named Jon, who was born on Aug. 16, 1932, and other harassments, largely from cranks and aggressive reporters. Late in 1935 the Lindberghs moved to England to seek escape from what Lindbergh called the ''tremendous public hysteria'' that surrounded him in the United States. On May 12, 1937, their third child, a boy named Land was born in a London nursing home, where Mrs. Lindbergh had registered under an assumed name.         She accompanied her husband on his visits to aviation-industry plants in France and in Nazi Germany. But she was not present at a stag dinner in 1938 at the American Embassy in Berlin, when Hermann Göring, whom Hitler had named Air Minister in 1933, presented Lindbergh with a high German decoration.         Mr. Ross, the Lindbergh biographer, wrote that when, after the dinner, Lindbergh showed the medal-box to his wife, ''she opened it and glanced at the medal and looked away. Then she said, without the slightest trace of emotion, 'the Albatross.''' She was right. Lindbergh was widely criticized in the United States for having accepted a medal from the Nazi Government.         In 1939, shortly before the outbreak of World War II, the Lindberghs moved back to the United States, where Lindbergh's isolationist pronouncements made him widely unpopular. Mrs. Lindbergh accompanied her husband to gatherings of isolationists and did not take public exception to his views. She said later that he had been ''used'' by the Nazis but that he had been genuinely ''astonished and impressed by the rapid growth of German air power,'' while also recognizing the danger it posed.         A. Scott Berg's 1998 biography of her husband, ''Lindbergh'' (Putnam), which drew on previously inaccessible family papers provided by Mrs. Lindbergh, showed that she was more aware of the flaws in Charles Lindbergh's character than had been thought. Mr. Berg reported problems in Mrs. Lindbergh's marriage that were painful for her, among them her husband's frequent absences, his bossiness, argumentativeness and emotional remoteness. After the birth of each of their six children, Mr. Berg wrote, Lindbergh would take his wife away on long plane journeys, some lasting weeks, as a way of ''weaning'' her from her children. He was angry at her displays of emotion (even after the kidnapping and murder of their child), and he would scold her if she complained she was having trouble with her writing.         Summing up, Mr. Berg wrote that the couple's relationship was ''a complex case history of control and repression, filled with joy and passion and grief and rage.'' He said in a 1998 interview that there was no doubt that Lindbergh ''deeply loved his wife and children, but that love manifested itself in unusual ways. It's ironic that it was Lindbergh who fostered his own wife's feminism. He very much wanted her to stand on her own two feet and, in helping her do so, created so much independence that it almost separated them.''         Falling in Love With Other Men         In the summer of 1939, Mr. Berg wrote, Mrs. Lindbergh, ''living less with Charles than through him, only knew that she was feeling incomplete and unfulfilled -- and mildly depressed.'' And then she, ''most unexpectedly, found inspiration, and even more, as she fell in love with another man.'' The man was Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, the renowned French aviator-author, who visited the Lindberghs at their house in Lloyd Neck, N.Y. Mrs. Lindbergh and Saint-Exupéry talked in French, just the two of them, for hours. She was thrilled and bewitched when he spoke to her about her writing.         But she did not leave her husband for Saint-Exupéry, who already had both a wife and a paramour. He vanished in 1944 on a reconnaissance mission.         Charles Lindbergh's abhorrence of any display of emotion or weakness took a toll on his family. Mrs. Lindbergh suffered from depression and in defiance of her husband had daily psychotherapy sessions for a time, wrote Susan Hertog, a freelance journalist and photographer, in her biography ''Anne Morrow Lindbergh'' (Doubleday, 1999).         In ''Lindbergh'' Mr. Berg wrote that she became close to Dr. Dana W. Atchley, an internist affiliated with Presbyterian Hospital in Manhattan, who also had a difficult marriage. ''The friendship of these two longing souls blossomed into a love affair in 1956,'' Mr. Berg wrote, ''and continued for the next few years.''         Mrs. Lindbergh discussed with friends the possibility of a divorce, Mr. Berg reported, but she realized that she did not want one.         They continued to lead lives that were largely sheltered and secretive until Charles Lindbergh, suffering from cancer, died in 1974 at age 72 on the Hawaiian island of Maui. He and his wife were married for 45 years and it was the only enduring relationship of his life. In her later years Mrs. Lindbergh spent much of her time in her secluded house in Darien, Conn., where she edited her diaries and letters for publication. Mrs. Lindbergh's elder daughter, Anne Spencer Lindbergh, who was also a writer, died in 1993. In addition to her daughter Reeve, Mrs. Lindbergh  is survived by her sons Jon, Land and Scott.         Reeve Lindbergh had a baby son who died in 1985 at almost exactly the same age as Anne Morrow Lindbergh's firstborn. Reeve's baby was known as Jonny, and she wrote in her book: ''Jonny too died in the night, and I, like my mother before me, was apart from my son during his last moments. I too thought that the baby was safely asleep in his crib.''         Jonny's death, while he and his mother were staying with Anne Morrow Lindbergh in Connecticut, was caused by ''a seizure related to infant encephalitis,'' his mother wrote. When she went to wake him the next morning, he was dead. His body was already stiff and blue.         Reeve recalled that she and her mother made the necessary emergency telephone calls, and ''Then, because she insisted upon it, my mother and I went and sat together with Jonny's body, in two chairs, next to the crib where he had gone to sleep the night before.''         As they sat, Anne Morrow Lindbergh said: ''I never saw my child's body after he died. I never sat with my son this way.''         Seeking Balance Between Solitude and Communion         Here are some excerpts from Anne Morrow Lindbergh's books ''North to the Orient'' and ''Gift From the Sea'':         All afternoon we had flown over miles and miles of perfectly flat treeless land, mottled with lakes and marshes. Toward evening we came upon a gray glassy lake, bounded by gray bleak shores a little higher than the marshes. And on shore, the only points of accent in that monotonous landscape, stood three or four white houses. This was Baker Lake. We circled over the flagpole . . . the church steeple, and cut across the dull satin water of the lake to the little group of people on shore. As we pushed near the sandy bank I had a closer view of the land, gray again -- no trees, no hills, nothing but gray moss, gray water, and a gray sky. How could anything live there, even animals? For this was the trading post. . . .         My husband switched off the motor. The propeller clicked around idly and stopped. There was no noise except the lapping of our wash against the sand. The group of men on shore, a few white men, and Eskimos in pointed Santa Claus hoods, came forward. The Canadian mounted officer, tall and handsome in his red coat, put out a hand to us. ''We've reserved tickets for the show tonight. I hope you'll come!''         ''What's that?'' said my husband, not knowing whether to laugh or not, as he looked at the four lone houses. Great guffaws from the group.         When I jumped out, the three or four Eskimos drew back. Then two little Eskimo boys came up shyly and followed me about. Their bright eyes shone under their caps as they searched my face and costume curiously.         ''You see,'' explained one of the traders, ''you're the first white woman they've ever seen. There's never been one here before.''  -- From ''North to the Orient''  (1935, Harcourt, Brace)         To be a woman is to have interests and duties, raying out in all directions from the central mother-core, like spokes from the hub of a wheel. The pattern of our lives is essentially circular. We must be open to all points of the compass: husband, children, friends, home, community; stretched out, exposed, sensitive like a spider's web to each breeze that blows, to each call that comes. How difficult for us, then, to achieve a balance in the midst of these contradictory tensions, and yet how necessary for the proper functioning of our lives. How much we need, and how arduous of attainment is that steadiness preached in all rules for holy living. How desirable and how distant is the ideal of the contemplative, artist, or saint -- the inner inviolable core, the single eye.         With a new awareness, both painful and humorous, I begin to understand why the saints were rarely married women. I am convinced it has nothing inherently to do, as I once supposed, with chastity or children. It has to do primarily with distractions. The bearing, rearing, feeding and educating of children; the running of a house with its thousand details; human relationships with their myriad pulls -- woman's normal occupations in general run counter to creative life, or contemplative life, or saintly life. The problem is not merely one of Woman and Career, Woman and the Home, Woman and Independence. It is more basically: how to remain whole in the midst of the distractions of life; how to remain balanced, no matter what centrifugal forces tend to pull one off center; how to remain strong, no matter what shocks come in at the periphery and tend to crack the hub of the wheel.         What is the answer? There is no easy answer, no complete answer. I have only clues, shells from the sea. The bare beauty of the channelled whelk tells me that one answer, and perhaps a first step, is in simplification of life, in cutting out some of the distractions. But how? Total retirement is not possible, I cannot shed my responsiblities. I cannot permanently inhabit a desert island. I cannot be a nun in the midst of family life. I would not want to be. The solution for me, surely, is neither in total renunciation of the world, nor in total acceptance of it. I must find a balance somewhere, or an alternating rhythm between these two extremes; a swinging of the pendulum between solitude and communion, between retreat and return. In my periods of retreat, perhaps I can learn something to carry back into my worldly life. I can at least practice for these two weeks the simplification of outward life, as a beginning.  -- From ''Gift From the Sea''  (1955, Pantheon)       
         Maureen Reagan, the outspoken daughter of former President Ronald Reagan who was often at odds with her father's policies, died yesterday at her home in Sacramento. She was 60, and had suffered a recurrence of melanoma, a skin cancer with which she was first diagnosed in 1996 and that, after some years in remission, recurred last fall.         Ms. Reagan was a politically active feminist who worked to support the proposed equal rights amendment, lobbied for abortion rights and helped elect women to public office.  She had a distant relationship with her father for decades after he and  her mother, the actress Jane Wyman, divorced in 1948.         Although Ms. Reagan volunteered her services in 1966 when her father  ran for governor of California, his consultants rejected her offer on the ground that her participation would again bring Mr. Reagan's divorce to the attention of the public. She recalled a news release at the time that said Mr. Reagan and his wife Nancy, whom he married in 1952, had had two children, Patti and Ronnie, and did not mention her or her brother Michael.         A thaw between father and daughter began when Mr. Reagan ran for president in 1980.         ''When he was elected president, she had more communication and involvement with her father than she had had for the rest of her life,'' her friend Judy Carter, the daughter-in-law of former President Jimmy Carter, said in 1989.         Ms. Reagan, too, tried her hand at politics. She was twice defeated in Republican primary races in California, for the United States Senate in 1982 and for a Southern California Congressional seat in 1992. Her first campaign was undermined by reports that her father, then president, did not want her involved in the race, but a decade later he endorsed her Congressional run.         To accusations that she was trading on the Reagan name, she said, ''I don't run because of my name but I don't run from it.'' She noted that people who accused her of exploiting family ties ''forget I was a Republican before the president was.''         ''I licked my first envelope in 1960,'' Ms. Reagan said, ''and I've never stopped working.''         She said that as an 11-year-old watching television coverage of the 1952 presidential conventions, she preferred the Republicans ''because they were better organized.''         At an even younger age, she exhibited the traits for which she was known throughout her life: strong will and impatience. As one of her critics once said, she was ''simply not schooled in the ways of holding her tongue.''         In 1987, after the Iran-contra affair, when Ms. Reagan asserted that Lt. Col. Oliver L. North and Vice Adm. John M. Poindexter, President Reagan's national security aides,  should be court-martialed for their actions, Mr. Reagan told Republican leaders, ''I gave up arguing with my daughter long ago.''         Maureen Elizabeth Reagan was born on Jan. 4, 1941, and in her early school years attended the Chadwick School in Palos Verdes Estates, Calif., as a boarder. She went to Emerson Junior High School in Los Angeles and to high school at Immaculate Heart in Hollywood. After a year at Marymount College of Virginia in Arlington she dropped out because, she said, ''I wanted to do something, be somewhere, I wanted to be an actress, and to be one, you had to know something of the world.''         When she left school, her father  told her, ''Well, write if you get work.''         The work she got was as a secretary in Washington, where she also took part in local theater. She soon returned to the West, to Las Vegas and California, where she sang in nightclubs, did a few commercials (Duncan Hines and Crisco) and had bit parts in television shows (''The Partridge Family'' and ''Marcus Welby, M.D.'') and in the 1964 Elvis Presley movie ''Kissin' Cousins.'' In her 1989 book, ''First Father, First Daughter,'' (Little, Brown & Company), Ms. Reagan recalled, ''I went out on so many auditions I began to think of changing my middle name to Rejection.''         Her brief television and movie career was followed by a stint as a talk show host on KABC Radio in Los Angeles, and in 1969 she joined a U.S.O. tour of Vietnam.         By 1980, Ms. Reagan was director of an organization called Sell Overseas America, which promoted American products abroad, a position she resigned two years later to pursue her Senate campaign.         Ms. Reagan's book revealed that she had been the victim of domestic  violence in her first marriage, in 1960, to John Filippone, a Washington policeman. The marriage lasted barely a year. A 1964 marriage to David Sills, a Marine lieutenant, ended in divorce in 1968.         Her husband of 20 years, Dennis Revell, a public relations executive in Sacramento, survives her as does a daughter, Rita, whom the couple adopted from Uganda in 1994. In addition to her father, stepmother and siblings, she is also survived by her mother.         Although she was an ardent Republican, Ms. Reagan angered many members of the party by her refusal to compromise and for stepping on toes. In 1983, she was given the title of special consultant to the Republican National Committee and moved to the family quarters in the White House.         When asked if she had been happy with her father's record on women's issues , she said: ''No, I haven't. I think there could be a much better record and I would certainly place the blame, I think, where it belongs. That's in the hands of certain people on the senior staff, who have never really accepted that there is a political power of women and that has to be addressed.''         Larry Speakes, a White House spokesman in the Reagan administration, noted in his book ''Speaking Out,'' that the president's aides, including Secretary of State George P. Shultz, were afraid of Ms. Reagan, known to many as Big Mo.         ''You would avoid her if possible and agree with her if you had to deal with her,'' Mr. Speakes wrote.         Ms. Reagan's most active political years were in the 1980's, when she was a member of the California World Trade Commission, chairwoman of the United States delegation to the United Nations Decade for Women Conference in Kenya, in 1985; co-chairwoman of the Republican National Committee, and chairwoman of the Republican Women's Political Action League.         As Ms. Reagan became more influential, she worked to increase Republican fund-raising for women running for office.         Ms. Reagan said she first recognized the symptoms of Alzheimer's in her father in 1994 when he was unable to recall the part he had played in a movie. ''Actors always remember the roles they played,'' she said. She joined the Alzheimer's Association board and began traveling the country to raise research money.         Her personal and political creed was perhaps best summed up in a 1982 interview. ''People who hurt my friends I have a lot of trouble forgiving,'' she said. ''People who hurt me I tend to forgive but I never forget.''       
         Nora Sayre, a film critic and essayist best known for her commentary on the cultural effects of the cold war -- died yesterday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 68 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was emphysema, said Mary Sayre Haverstock, her cousin.         As the child of parents who knew both the New York and Hollywood writing scenes, Ms. Sayre witnessed firsthand the struggles of writers in the crosswinds of America's anti-Communist fervor, which she later insisted both preceded and continued long after the era of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy's red-hunting in the early 1950's. In ''Running Time: Films of the Cold War'' (1982, Dial Press), her second book, she analyzed the effect of this fervor on Hollywood movie-making in the 1950's.         In her next book, ''Previous Convictions: A Journey Through the 1950's'' (1995, Rutgers University Press), she dug deeper into the period. ''The readiness to challenge and then contradict official wisdom was supposed to be an American tradition,'' she wrote, ''but that kind of autonomy was rare in the 1950's, and I was fortunate to come of age among people who took their independence for granted.''         Reviewing ''Previous Convictions,'' David Caute, a historian of anti-Communism, described Ms. Sayre as ''an essayist whose light touch masks the formidable weight of her judgments'' and whose ''natural province is not so much history as people's consciousness.'' He continued, ''Her fault is sometimes to seek out complications which may not be there -- as in her accounts of former Communists who still feel they were right to be wrong -- but this flaw is no doubt reinforced by her affection for individuals she meets and her refusal to accept any aspect of American cold war ideology.''         Nora Clemens Sayre was born on Sept. 20, 1932, in Hamilton, Bermuda, the only child of Joel Sayre, a staff writer and war correspondent for The New Yorker and occasional Hollywood screenwriter -- he wrote ''Annie Oakley'' (1935) for Barbara Stanwyck and was a co-writer on ''Gunga Din'' (1939) -- and Gertrude (Lynahan) Sayre, a reporter for The New York World. Ms. Sayre attended the Putney School, in Vermont, graduating in 1950, and Radcliffe College, where, as she later described herself, she was apolitical and hung out with the aesthetes and actors who founded the Poets' Theater in Cambridge, and where she graduated cum laude in 1954.         ''Like a lot of my generation, I grew up with no politics at all,'' she told Brian Close, a student at the Columbia Journalism School, in a recent interview. ''I didn't even read the newspaper. Mine was a rather liberated family. But it was a very square time. Even the freest spirts were cautious. Clearly life was safer and easier if you had no politics.''         In 1955, the year after her graduation from Radcliffe, she took off for Europe with an eye to ''blotting out,'' she later reported, her parents' unhappy marriage and her mother's suicidal depressions. In London, wafted by her parents' literary connections, she met the likes of Arthur Koestler, his lover the novelist Elizabeth Jane Howard (future wife of Kingsley Amis), James Thurber, A. J. Liebling, Walker Evans, Cyril Connolly, Henry Green, Graham Greene and Charlie and Oona Chaplin. She also met members of the American community in exile -- targets of Hollywood blacklisting and the United States' anti-communist campaign -- which was centered around Frognal, the house of Donald Ogden Stewart and Ella Winter, his Australian-born wife.         It was in England that she became more politically aware -- ''they may have more of a vigorous opposition than we do,'' she told Mr. Close -- and realized she was ''somewhat of a lefty.'' As she reports in her recently published memoir of that time, ''On the Wing: A Young American Abroad'' (2001, Counterpoint), she was often considered fair game by sexually avaricious older writers.         Under the tutelage of the literary critic John Davenport, she began to write for publication. As she recalled in ''On the Wing,'' ''He would arrive for an unscheduled lunch in my Bourne Street basement, bringing bacon and frozen string beans and books and imperatives: 'Why don't you eat this, read this, write about that.' Soon these editorial sessions were part of my London week: he read my pieces before I submitted them -- plucking out passages that needed polishing but never suggesting any words of his own'' and ''instilling a horror of clichés.''         She landed a job writing book reviews for The New Statesman. ''I don't want to give too much credit to the Brits because I am no Anglophile,'' she told Mr. Close, ''but they give a writer so much more freedom, especially then.'' Ms. Sayre eventually returned to the United States in the early 1960's. She had been through a brief, unsuccessful marriage to Robert Neild, a former Royal Air Force pilot, a lecturer in economics at Cambridge and a rising figure in the Labor Party.         Ms. Sayre served as New York correspondent for the New Statesman from 1965 until 1970. Her first book, a collection of pieces titled ''Sixties Going on Seventies'' (Rutgers University Press) -- which covered everything from student strikes and yippies to the 1972 Democratic and Republican Conventions  -- led to her employment at The New York Times in 1973 when her book was recommended to Arthur Gelb, then managing editor of the paper, as deserving of a review. Mr. Gelb was inspired by it to appoint her movie reviewer for The Times.         She left The Times in 1975 and for the next seven years worked as a freelancer, writing for The New York Times Book Review, The Nation, The Progressive and Esquire, among other publications, and winning a Guggenheim fellowship, 1975-76, and a National Endowment for the Arts grant, 1978. ''I managed for those seven years to break even with no other income at all,'' she told Mr. Close. ''I was able to travel. I was able to go to the dentist.'' She added: ''Freelancer has become a very offensive term. Ten years ago it was legitimate. Maybe. Now it's just another word for 'unemployed.' ''         In 1981 she became a visiting lecturer in Columbia University's writing program. Over the course of her career she also served as a lecturer and instructor in various writing workshops, including as a participant in the visiting authors program of the Woodrow Wilson National Fellowship Foundation, the lecture series at the Museum of Modern Art, and at the Museum of Television and Radio. She was writer in residence for a semester at James Thurber House in Columbus, Ohio, and a frequent resident at Yaddo, the artists' colony in Saratoga Springs, N.Y.         She is survived by her cousin, of Oberlin, Ohio.         Ms. Sayre was proud of having covered every presidential political convention from the time she returned to this country, and she continued to work eight hours a day up until the time she entered the hospital. Living in a New York City apartment bought for her by friends, partly to help her out and partly as an investment, she wrote drafts on yellow legal pads -- ''like Richard Nixon,'' she told Mr. Close. ''It isn't all writing,'' she explained. ''Some of it is rewriting or looking at things with a critical eye. It is very easy to fill eight hours this way.''         She described herself to Mr. Close as ''of a certain age.'' She added: ''It isn't vanity, dear, but unfortunately writers are downgraded in our earnings, based on our age. They think we become less capable of grasping things.''       
         Barbara K. Olson, who was killed on Tuesday on the commercial jetliner that was hijacked and flown into the Pentagon, was well known to television viewers across the nation as a combative and confident political commentator representing the conservative Republican point of view.         Mrs. Olson, 45, was also half of a highly influential couple on Washington's social-political scene; her husband, Theodore B. Olson, an appellate lawyer, successfully argued the Florida election case for George W. Bush before the Supreme Court. President Bush named Mr. Olson the nation's solicitor general, the official who formulates the administration's strategy before the nation's courts.         Mr. Olson was in his Justice Department office on Tuesday morning when he received two calls from Mrs. Olson, who was using her cell phone aboard American Airlines Flight 77 to tell him the plane had been hijacked. Her description of what was occurring in her last moments provided what officials said was valuable information about the incident. She reported that the flight crew had been herded to the back of the plane with the passengers, and she asked her husband what she should tell the pilot who was apparently beside her while the hijackers were in control of the cockpit.         Mrs. Olson's friends and her husband said her efforts to ''do something'' on the doomed plane were exquisitely in character. ''She never sat back,'' her husband said in an interview.         The Olsons, who were married four years ago, complemented each other in style. Mrs. Olson was the more outspoken of the two in her televised commentaries, while Mr. Olson presented a more deliberative face in his role as the reigning constitutional litigator for the Republican establishment.         Although Mrs. Olson was generally a take-no-prisoners advocate, Mr. Olson recalled on Tuesday that she recently told him she had come to believe that the national political debate had become too acrimonious. He recalled that she said that during one television appearance, she believed those who called in comments to her and her liberal counterpart, Bill Press, were far too harsh.         Barbara Kay Bracher Olson was born on Dec. 27, 1955, in Houston, and trained to be a teacher at the University of St. Thomas in her hometown. But, she had told friends, she wanted to save enough money to go to law school and decided a quicker way to do so than teaching was to become a part of the film industry.         With no experience in the field but  an abundance of self-confidence, she moved to Hollywood and began telephoning production companies connected to well-known actors, offering herself as an all-around helper. Stacy Keach finally offered her a job, Mr. Olson recalled this week, and when she saved enough money to go to law school, she moved to New York to attend the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law at Yeshiva University.         Mrs. Olson turned down jobs in New York after law school because she yearned to live in Washington. As chief counsel for the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee's Republican majority from  1995 to 1996, Mrs. Olson led the investigation into President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton's role in firing longtime employees of the White House travel office. She became a caustic and relentless critic of the Clintons.         Mrs. Olson wrote ''Hell to Pay'' (Regnery, 1999), a highly critical book about Mrs. Clinton, and recently finished a sequel, ''Final Days,'' about the Clintons' last weeks in the White House. Mr. Olson said it would be published by Regnery.         Mrs. Olson is survived by her brother, David Bracher, and her sister, Antoinette Lawrence, both of Houston, as well as her husband.       
         LAST week, as the fiercely partisan legislators of the virtually bankrupt Nassau County turned blue in the face during an all-night fight over their 2002 budget, the inner schoolmarm, dormant since she left teaching for politics, emerged in the presiding officer, Judith A. Jacobs. The county was just a few days and decimal points from a budget takeover by a state-appointed board, and instead of finding a solution to a $45 million deficit, from her vantage point, its legislators were behaving like kindergartners.         So she indulged in a momentary power trip, something she says she avoided in two years of playing peacemaker among 18 colleagues. Tired of banging her gavel and yelling for order in her court, she pressed an index finger to the mute button, effectively smothering every microphone in the room. The silence was shocking, and restorative: they reverted to adults.         Around 4:30 a.m., the exhausted legislators crept home after a budget was approved for perusal by the not-quite-lame-duck county executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, who yesterday vetoed parts of it and cut a proposed property tax increase to 9 percent from the 15 percent that Ms. Jacobs and her fellow Democrats had supported. The budget now goes to the Nassau Interim Finance Authority, the state chaperon, which has the power to take over the county's finances if it does not accept the budget. Though she admits to being ''on pins and needles,'' on that overlong evening Ms. Jacobs, a loquacious 62-year-old Democrat, was the only one to go home chuckling. Pushing the panic button was more fun than expected.         ''I don't like to use it,'' she says of the magical mute. ''I don't look at myself as Judge Judy, but I'll tell you the truth, I've learned to stop the nonsensible rhetoric when it gets really destructive. And that night it was out of control.''         She's still chuckling about it, her plump frame nestled into a brown leather couch in the den of the Woodbury split-level she says she has seen very little of in the past two years of budget crises. She loves her $67,000-a-year job, spending 10 or 11 hours a day at the office or out among the public that awarded her a third term and 80 percent of the vote as the representative for the county's Legislative District 16. This pit stop on the home front is such a rarity that she even had to reintroduce herself to the U.P.S. deliveryman who showed up with a package to add to the pile of wrapped Hanukkah presents (she has four grandchildren) in the dining room. ''He was shocked to see me here in broad daylight,'' she said.         Her silver Lexus with the vanity plates 1 JUJU rests in the driveway after a morning trip to the Woodbury Jewish Center to explain the proposed 15 percent tax increase to 150 elderly residents; she thinks she won them over by being honest. Her kitchen is Martha Stewart spotless, and why not? She confesses that it's hardly used. That enticing vanilla cake on the pedestal, the limes and lemons in clear canisters, the bowl of vegetables: all fakes. ''I never baked a cake that looked that good back when I actually cooked.''         But she is quite proficient with budget ingredients. According to her, without the 15 percent tax increase, Nassau, the black sheep of the state's counties for receiving a $45 million bailout to protect its bonds from junk bond status (''Embarrassing!''), won't have a workable 2002 budget. That's what she warned her morning audience. ''The response I got was, 'Just fix it already!' ''         But the Republicans continue to holler for cuts, and Ms. Jacobs, her color deepening beneath her pale perm, her manner revealing how she earned the reputation as ''the lady with the hammer'' back in her civic activist decades, insists that cuts are not a cure.         ''They have not been participants, they've been obstructionists,'' she says of the Republicans, then quotes a letter from the minority leader, Peter Schmitt, in response to her request to specify cuts. ''He said, 'My grandmother always used to say, if you have weeds in your garden, don't point to weeds in mine.' Now that is not an answer. Rhetoric is so cheap but so unrealistic at a time of distress like this,'' she adds. She says that if Democrats had had the stranglehold on Nassau County, she probably would have been a Republican; she's contrarian that way.         MS. JACOBS, who moved from Queens to Woodbury with her husband, Sid, in 1967, was politicized by a classic case of ''not in my backyard'': she awakened to the rumble of bulldozers ripping apart cornfields to make space for a decidedly unbucolic Geico insurance building. She and her neighbors protested, babes in arms, and were hauled off to the town offices for a talking-to by the police chief. ''We were the original Mad Mothers of Woodbury,'' she says. Next came her days of RAGE, an acronym for Residents Against Garbage Expansion.         She ran unsuccessfully for the Oyster Bay Town Board in 1977, but when the County Board of Supervisors was replaced by the County Legislature in 1995, she won a seat, a powerless seat. ''In 1996 there were six Democrats out of 19 legislators; if we'd all left for California for five years, nobody would have cared,'' she says. In 1999, the Democrats gained a majority and Ms. Jacobs became presiding officer, a position she hopes to retain despite backing a friend, Assemblyman Thomas P. DiNapoli, in the primary against Thomas R. Suozzi, the incoming county executive. That decision is expected this weekend, and Ms. Jacobs is not sweating it.         ''I don't mean to be corny,'' she says, ''but I like to believe you are what you've been.''         PUBLIC LIVES
