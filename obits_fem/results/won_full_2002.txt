         Eileen Heckart, the actress with a smoky voice and toothsome smile who won an Oscar for ''Butterflies Are Free,'' three Emmys and a special lifetime achievement Tony, died on Monday at her home in Norwalk, Conn. She was 82.         The cause was cancer, her son Mark said.         One of those ubiquitous actresses who always seemed to be working, Ms. Heckart was perhaps most widely known for her television appearances as Mary Richards's Aunt Flo on the Mary Tyler Moore show, for example, or more recently for her recurring role of the mother of the lawyer James Wyler in the ABC drama ''Murder One.''         Her best-remembered film roles include the mother of Rocky Graziano in ''Somebody Up There Likes Me'' (1956) Marilyn Monroe's waitress friend in ''Bus Stop'' (also 1956) and the overbearing mother of the blind boy in ''Butterflies Are Free,'' for which she won the Academy Award as best supporting actress in 1972.         But the actress often said in interviews that her heart belonged to the stage and that was where she performed the bulk of her work.         She played her share of drinkers --  like the spinster teacher in ''Picnic'' in 1953 and the alcoholic mother whose son drowns in ''The Bad Seed'' in 1955, both on Broadway.         Most recently, in 2000, she played Gladys Green, the lead in ''The Waverly Gallery,'' Kenneth Lonergan's empathetic study of an elderly woman with Alzheimer's disease.         Writing in The New York Times, Ben Brantley called her performance ''uncanny'' and praised her  ''beautifully coherent and intelligent portrayal of a woman sliding into incoherence.''         The actress was born Anna Eileen Heckart in Columbus, Ohio, on March 29, 1919.         Her parents separated when she was 2. Her father, Leo Herbert Heckart, took her younger brother to live with him, she said, but she remained with her mother, Esther, who was married five times.         Ms. Heckart graduated in 1942 from Ohio State University in Columbus, where she she caught whooping cough, which resulted in the deepening of her voice.         After graduation, she married her college sweetheart, John Harrison Yankee Jr., who became an insurance broker. The couple had three sons, Mark, of Norwalk; Philip, of Stratford, Conn.; and Luke, of Los Angeles, all of whom survive her, along with two half-sisters and Mark's two daughters.         Ms. Heckart began her career in summer stock, came to New York and cut her teeth in live television -- -- ''The Alcoa Hour,'' ''The Philco Television Playhouse,'' ''Goodyear Television Playhouse'' and ''Playhouse 90.''         Her first break onstage came in William Inge's ''Picnic,'' when she was 33. She played a schoolteacher with, as Brooks Atkinson put it in The New York Times, ''a hunger for life and a knack for getting it.''         She made her Broadway debut in 1943 as understudy and assistant stage manager for ''The Voice of the Turtle.''         After ''Picnic'' came ''The Bad Seed.'' Then ''Butterflies are Free'' on Broadway with Keir Dullea and Blythe Danner, in which she played Mr. Dullea's mother.         In 1965, she created the role of the disapproving mother in the Broadway production of ''Barefoot in the Park,'' while also appearing in episodes of television series like ''Gunsmoke'' and ''The FBI.''         The PBS productions ''Save Me a Place at Forest Lawn'' and ''The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds,'' both in 1966, won Ms. Heckart a host of television awards.         Among her other plays were ''The Dark at the Top of the Stairs,'' ''Our Town,'' ''They Knew What They Wanted,'' ''A View From the Bridge,'' ''Mother Courage'' and ''Time of the Cuckoo.''         During a decade of absence from the New York stage, she toured in national companies of Broadway hits, acted in movies and won roles in four separate television series that were picked up and then dropped. The last of these was ''Annie McGuire,'' in 1988, in which Ms. Heckart played Mary Tyler Moore's mother.         When she returned to the theater in the 1989 production of Lee Blessing's play, ''Eleemosynary,'' the Times theater critic Frank Rich welcomed her back.         ''There are some absent friends you don't realize how much you've been missing until they suddenly pop up again,'' he wrote.         ''Ms. Heckart is what one might describe as a long actress,'' Mr. Rich continued, ''long of face, of torso, of tongue. There is mischief in her big glistening eyes. And when she speaks, it is in the low, crystalline, merry rasp of a wise aunt who has seen and understood everything (perhaps with cigarette in hand), relished most of it and can't wait for the next adventure.''         Ms. Heckart smoked up until her death and blamed her friend Bette Davis for her addiction. ''I went to a hypnotist and managed to stop smoking for six months,'' Ms. Heckart recalled in a 1989 interview with The Times. ''Then I appeared in 'Burnt Offerings' with Bette. Well, she smoked all day, and then she asked me to dinner. Pretty soon, I asked her for just one cigarette. Then I had another. And then I was a smoker again.''         In 1997, Ms. Heckart's husband died suddenly on his morning walk. ''I looked out the window and he was gone,'' she told The Times in April 2000. ''It was the worst year of my life.'' The two had been married for 53 years.         She was awarded a special Tony in 2000 for her lifetime of theater work.         In another Times interview Ms. Heckart said her current role in ''The Waverly Gallery'' was her best, except perhaps for her part in ''Mother Courage.''         She also said it would be her last. ''This is my swan song, my last performance in a play,'' she said. ''It just takes too much energy.''         Speaking of her role, she added,  ''You get such a good one, you may as well go out on a wave.''         Correction:  January 4, 2002, Friday  An obituary of the actress Eileen Heckart on Wednesday referred incorrectly to her Broadway appearance as the mother (Mrs. Banks) in ''Barefoot in the Park.'' She did not create the role; she succeeded Mildred Natwick. The article also misstated the number of Emmy Awards she received. It was two, not three.       
         Peggy Lee, whose sultry singing style set standards for pop jazz sophistication for more than half a century, died on Monday night at her home in Los Angeles. She was 81.         The cause was a heart attack, said her daughter, Nicki Lee Foster. Ms. Lee had surmounted many medical problems to continue performing until the last few years.         She was billed throughout most of her career as Miss Peggy Lee (and, in fact, she insisted on it). In the golden age of big bands she was a singer of renown with Benny Goodman's orchestra and she went on to become a top nightclub singer, a prolific recording artist, a successful songwriter and an actress skillful enough to be nominated for an Oscar.         Duke Ellington called her ''the Queen.'' She was a weaver of moods and colors, her misty voice conveying impeccable rhythmic subtlety and smoldering sexuality. In a world of belters, she was a minimalist who eliminated any hint of the extraneous in both her voice and gestures, and she could stir audiences with an understated phrase more than most singers could by shouting and stomping.         Stephen Holden, a movie and cabaret critic for The New York Times, described her image as ''Billie Holiday meets Mae West.''         Miss Lee made more than 700 recordings and more than 60 albums. Her own favorite album, ''The Man I Love,'' was recorded in 1957 with arrangements by Nelson Riddle and an orchestra conducted by Frank Sinatra. Sinatra was so intimately involved with the album that he obtained some menthol to make Miss Lee's eyes look properly misty for the cover photograph.         She is credited with having a hand in writing more than 200 songs, in most cases as a lyricist. Among the hits she wrote were ''I Don't Know Enough About You,'' ''It's a Good Day,'' and ''Ma√±ana (Is Soon Enough for Me).'' Her name is indelibly linked with a number of songs, including ''Golden Earrings,'' ''Fever,'' ''Lover,'' ''Big Spender,'' ''You're My Thrill,'' ''I Got It Bad and That Ain't Good,'' ''Them There Eyes'' and the haunting Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller tune that became her signature in later years, ''Is That All There Is?''         ''She makes her listeners feel cherished,'' Whitney Balliett wrote of her in The New Yorker. ''Her singing lulls you, and it is easy to forget how daring it is. Many singers confuse shouting with emotion. Peggy Lee sends her feelings down the quiet center of her notes.''         ''She is a subtle and brilliant showman,'' he added. ''She can slink, arch an eyebrow, pull out a hip and rest a hand on it, half smile, wave wandlike arms, bump, tilt her head and slouch -- all to dazzling, precise effect.''         Miss Lee was named Norma Deloris Egstrom at her birth on May 27, 1920, in Jamestown, N.D. She was the sixth of seven children of Marvin and Selma Egstrom. Her father was a railroad station agent who drank too much. His job kept the family moving from town to town in lonely parts of North Dakota. Her mother died when she was 4 and her father remarried. Five-year-old Norma was brutally abused by her stepmother, who would hit her over the head with an iron skillet, beat her with a razor strap and drag her around by her hair. By the age of 7, she was keeping house, baking, cooking, cleaning and milking cows.         There was never any doubt in her mind that she would become a singer. ''I had always sung -- I sang before I could talk,'' she reminisced in her 1989 autobiography, ''Miss Peggy Lee'' (Donald I. Fine). She was 14 when she made her professional debut at a local radio station in Jamestown and was still a teenager when a program director at a radio station in Fargo gave her a job and her stage name. The job paid $1.50 for each noonday show. To make ends meet, she worked a 4 p.m. to 4 a.m. shift in a bakery, slicing and wrapping bread for 35 cents an hour.         A friend who had gone to California suggested she join her. She sold the watch her father had given her at her high school graduation for $30, bought a train ticket and arrived in Hollywood with $18. She got a brief singing engagement in a supper club but mostly worked as a waitress before returning to North Dakota. She found work singing for a radio station in Fargo, then as a singer in Minneapolis with Will Osborne's band.         Miss Lee was discovered in Chicago in 1941 by Benny Goodman, who was looking for a replacement for his vocalist, Helen Forrest, who was leaving to join Artie Shaw's band. He heard her sing ''These Foolish Things'' at the Ambassador West Hotel and called the next day, offering her the job. She had a cold the first night she appeared, the critics were unkind, and she wanted to quit. Goodman refused to let her go and she stayed on, at $75 a week.         Later that year, the band played the New Yorker Hotel in Manhattan, and Miss Lee recalled in her autobiography how awed she had been to see Franchot Tone dancing by with Joan Crawford, Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne chatting at their table with Katharine Cornell, and Gary Cooper joking with Mayor Fiorello La Guardia.         It was Miss Lee's sulky rendition of ''Why Don't You Do Right?'' with the Goodman band in 1942 that made her a star. She sang the Joe McCoy song in a voice that demonstrated she could sing of hard times as well as anybody; her version became one of the the biggest selling records in the country:         You had plenty money nineteen twen'y-two         You let other women make a fool of you         Why don't you do right         Like some other men do?         Get out of here and get me some money, too.         Peggy Lee's tour with the Goodman band lasted less than two years but the collaboration made her one of the most famous female vocalists of the time and put her on the road to fame.         In 1943, Miss Lee left Goodman to marry Dave Barbour, the band's guitarist, with whom she collaborated on a number of hits, including ''I Don't Know Enough About You,'' ''It's a Good Day,'' and ''Ma√±ana,'' a 1948 blockbuster that sold more than two million records and began her long association with Latin-flavored music.         Her swirling 1952 version of the Richard Rodgers waltz ''Lover'' and her 1958 interpretation of ''Fever'' in six-eight time solidified her reputation as one of the most rhythmically inventive and versatile vocalists in pop.         She made her film debut in 1950, playing a minor role in ''Mr. Music,'' and went on, in 1953, to play a featured role opposite Danny Thomas in a remake of ''The Jazz Singer.'' Her performance as an alcoholic blues singer in ''Pete Kelly's Blues'' (1955) won her an Academy Award nomination as best supporting actress.         In 1959 she wrote the lyrics for a Duke Ellington song, ''I'm Gonna Go Fishing,'' for the film ''Anatomy of a Murder.''         She also wrote theme music for the movies ''Johnny Guitar'' and ''About Mrs. Leslie,'' and supplied voices for several characters and sang three songs in the 1952 Walt Disney animated film ''Lady and the Tramp.'' She was paid $3,500 by Disney and no royalties. When Disney marketed a videocassette without her consent, she sued the company. In 1992, after a four-year court battle, she was awarded $2.3 million.         Another lawsuit over royalties neared an end last week in Los Angeles, when a superior court judge gave preliminary approval for a $4.75-million settlement between Universal Music Group and several hundred recording artists whose lead plaintiff was Miss Lee. Universal acquired Miss Lee's contract and many others through a series of record company mergers over the years. The suit asserted that Universal had cheated artists by underreporting sales figures and overcharging for services. The company has admitted no wrongdoing, and language in the settlement bars both sides from commenting.         Peggy Lee was a perfectionist who planned every aspect of her performances right down to her hairdos, her costly gowns, her lighting, her entrances and exits, even the movement of her hands. She always appeared with first-rate musicians, including the drummer Grady Tate. For decades, because of respiratory problems that began with a bout of viral pneumonia in 1958, she kept oxygen in her dressing room, and she used it between sets.         Miss Lee's performances at Basin Street East in Manhattan beginning in 1959 were credited by Newsweek with ''single-handedly reviving the supper club business.'' Count Basie, Tallulah Bankhead, Cary Grant, Lena Horne and Ella Fitzgerald were some of the notables who crowded in every night. With more than 600 people in a space meant for 450, a club representative recalled later, ''we had to hire only skinny waiters.''         Her appearances at the Ballroom, a club in Chelsea, were also treated as events.         Miss Lee was married five times, but her great love, she acknowledged, was her first husband and collaborator, Mr. Barbour. He was the father of her only child, Nicki Lee Foster, of Sun Valley, Idaho. In addition to Ms. Foster, she is survived by three grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.         Miss Lee described Mr. Barbour in her autobiography as a self-destructive alcoholic. They were married in 1943 and she said in a 1982 interview that he asked her for a divorce in 1951, ''because he didn't want his daughter to see him with his problem.'' In 1965, after Mr. Barbour had been sober for many years, they decided to remarry, but a few days later he died.         Her second marriage, in 1955, to Brad Dexter, an actor, lasted less than a year, and her third, in 1956, to Dewey Martin, also an actor, ended in divorce in 1959. A fourth marriage, in 1964, to Jack Del Rio, a bandleader, also lasted less than a year.         Besides chronic respiratory problems, Miss Lee encountered a number of serious illnesses and accidents over the years.         Late in the 1970's, she returned to San Francisco from a European tour so ill she was immediately hospitalized. Doctors informed her she had a bad heart, diabetes and a disorder of the inner ear; she also went blind temporarily. She was told to retire but went to Australia on tour instead.         She had double-bypass heart surgery in 1985. Two years later she fell onstage at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas and fractured her pelvis. When she recovered, she fell again in the marble bathroom of her home in Bel Air section of Los Angeles, injuring the vertebrae in her lower spine.         Still she performed.         ''Peg,'' her musical autobiography, had a hard time on Broadway in 1983, and closed after 13 previews and five performances. It was a rare failure.         She usually appeared in slinky satin or form-fitting glittering gowns, drop-dead dangling earrings and large round tinted glasses. Later, a shoulder length white-blond wig covered her champagne-blond hair. Still later, she used a jeweled cane and often performed sitting down like Mabel Mercer. She had more heart problems in the early 1990's, her daughter said, and suffered a stroke in 1998 that left her bedridden. In 1992, Mr. Holden reviewed a Peggy Lee performance in New York for The Times and wrote that ''her will power, musicality and professionalism enable her to project a fair degree of the old magic.''         In 1990, she received the Pied Piper Award of the American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers,  Ascap's highest accolade, given for lifetime achievement.         During her last decade, she tried to retire several times. She painted (one of her paintings hung on the wall of Les C√©l√©brit√©s, a former restaurant in the Essex House in Manhattan), grew roses, watched nature programs on television, was active in the Science of Mind spiritual group,  and listened to Ray Charles, Sinatra, Debussy and Chopin. But it wasn't enough. So she would reappear periodically in smaller settings, basking in the warmth of her audiences.         Obituary       
         Elizabeth Mildred Riley, a prominent children's book editor, died Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 94 and lived on the Upper East Side.         Her publishing career was spent at the Thomas Y. Crowell Company, now merged into HarperCollins. She joined the company in 1938, rose to senior vice president in 1959 and retired about 30 years ago.         Ms. Riley built the children's division of Crowell and was especially noted for creating the ''Let's Read and Find Out'' series of science primers, started more than 40 years ago. She founded it with Dr. Franklyn Mansfield Branley, a science writer and teacher, as an introduction to a wide range of scientific subjects, attractively put together with pictures and plainly written texts. The books, designed for children from preschool through the early grades, counted well-known science writers among their authors. They have remained a pre-eminent series for decades, used in schools and libraries across the country.         Now the series is known as the Let's-Read-and-Find-Out Science Books. More than 100 have been published, with about 80 still in print and 6 new ones released each year by HarperCollins.         Elizabeth Riley, born on the West Side of Manhattan, graduated from New York University in 1928 and received a master's degree from Columbia University two years later. Her first job was selling books at department stores, including Macy's.         Munro Leaf -- a friend who was the creator of ''The Story of Ferdinand,'' the classic children's book about the bull who preferred smelling flowers to fighting other bulls -- recommended her to Crowell, where she started as a general editor. At the time, the publisher offered college textbooks but had nothing in print for young readers.         Ms. Riley was entrusted with creating the publishing house's children's book department, and she built it into one of the best. Many of the books she published won prizes, among them several Newbery medals as well as a Caldecott.         She retired when Crowell was bought by Dun & Bradstreet. From the time she joined Crowell, she had accepted stock options as bonuses; the takeover made her a well-to-do woman. But its terms also barred her from working any longer in children's books; she became a volunteer for the Metropolitan Museum of Art, working in textile conservation and helping to organize files and photographs.         For many years Ms. Riley also did volunteer work for the Grolier Club, Unicef, the Hroswitha Society of book collectors, and the Pierpont Morgan Library, where she served on the board for 24 years.         She left no immediate survivors.       
         Julia Phillips, the Hollywood producer who turned her rage at the stars and power brokers into the best-selling chronicle ''You'll Never Eat Lunch in This Town Again,'' died Tuesday at her apartment in West Hollywood. She was 57.         The cause was cancer, her daughter, Kate Phillips, said.         Julia Phillips was a producer of classics including ''Taxi Driver'' and ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind.'' The 1973 film ''The Sting,'' which she produced with her husband at the time, Michael Phillips, and Tony Bill, won seven Academy Awards, including best picture. She was the first woman to produce a film that won the best-picture Oscar.         But Ms. Phillips's film career was dwarfed by her angry 1991 book about Hollywood and what Ms. Phillips viewed as the mendacity, selfishness, greed and hypocrisy of the town. She skewered numerous famous people, including Steven Spielberg, David Geffen, Warren Beatty and Goldie Hawn. One producer described the book as ''the longest suicide note in history.''         But Ms. Phillips was far more brutal about herself than about any of the people she scorned. She detailed her descent into drugs, which almost killed her. She wrote that on Oscar night for ''The Sting'' in 1974, she took ''a diet pill, a small amount of coke, two joints, six halves of Valium, which make three, and a glass and a half of wine.'' The index listing of her name at the end of her book seemed to sum up her personal life: ''depressions of . . . drug wanderings of . . . pregnancies of . . . loneliness of . . . suicidal behavior of . . .''         As Ms. Phillips said in an interview several days before she died: ''I knew that if this book was going to be commercially viable, I would have to spill my guts. I knew I would have to be as honest as possible about myself as I was about all the others.''         To critics who termed the book cruel, she replied: ''We all have our standards. People behaved in an ugly and despicable fashion towards me. I felt no constraints.'' She added, ''Nothing I did in my book is as mean as any of the people I wrote about.''         Ms. Phillips was feisty, funny and blunt, and never stopped loving the movies. In the days before she died, she sat in her apartment overlooking Los Angeles and talked about them; she asked friends to bring her a tape of ''Ocean's Eleven'' because she adored George Clooney.         ''I couldn't have made it today in the movies,'' she said at one point. ''In the 70's people were making some great films. Look what they're making now.''         In the last decade, Ms. Phillips struggled in vain to write another best seller. In 1995 she wrote ''Driving Under the Affluence,'' a sometimes surreal personal examination of her problems with the Internal Revenue Service, the 1992 Los Angeles riots and 1994 earthquake, the impact of AIDS and the death of her father. In 2000 she helped Matt Drudge, the internet commentator, write his book ''Drudge Manifesto.''         In recent years, Ms. Phillips, who was constantly battling financial problems, said she had considered trying to return to the movies. But her few meetings with younger executives left her despondent. ''Did I really want to be patronized once more as a woman?'' she said recently. ''Did I really want to be told what a major motion picture was?''         Ms. Phillips was born in New York City on April 7, 1944. Her father, Adolph Miller, was a chemical engineer. Her mother, Tanya, was, in Ms. Phillips's words, a difficult and depressive woman who drove her daughter to intellectual pursuits.         Ms. Phillips grew up in Brooklyn; Great Neck, N.Y.; and Milwaukee and attended Mount Holyoke, where she won awards for creative writing.         She married Michael Phillips, a Dartmouth graduate, shortly after their graduations. Mr. Phillips became an investment banker and producer. They were divorced months after ''The Sting'' won its Oscars.         Ms. Phillips worked at Ladies' Home Journal and McCall's and then became a story editor in the New York offices of Paramount Pictures. Her career started moving quickly when she was hired to find material for Barbra Streisand, among other jobs. Ms. Phillips helped get the rights to ''Yentl'' years before it was made.         In her mid-20's Ms. Phillips and her husband met the actor-producer Tony Bill, and the three optioned ''The Sting'' and ''Steelyard Blues,'' which became a film starring Jane Fonda and Donald Sutherland and was made with the support of Richard Zanuck and David Brown.         The Phillipses moved to Los Angeles and soon became the nucleus of a group of young, dynamic filmmakers who were, essentially, taking over Hollywood in the 1970's, a time when the studio system was crumbling. Their friends included Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese, Robert De Niro, John Milius, Paul Schrader and others. It was also a time when drugs proliferated in Hollywood.         The high point of her career was Oscar night in 1974. Upon being handed the Academy Award for best picture by Elizabeth Taylor, Ms. Phillips said, ''You can't imagine what a trip it is for a nice Jewish girl from Great Neck to win an Academy Award and meet Elizabeth Taylor in the same night.''         The breakup of her marriage, drugs and a series of sour relationships with men, along with being elbowed out of the power loop in the making of ''Close Encounters of the Third Kind,'' pushed her over the edge. At one point, after a 30-day rehabilitation stay at the Mayo Clinic, Ms. Phillips said she had spent more than $120,000 on cocaine. By the early 1980's, Ms. Phillips said, she had turned her back on drugs with the help of various therapies.         Ms. Phillips recalled that she began writing her book because she was running out of money and felt a deep grievance against many in Hollywood. The book took several years to write and 14 months for Random House lawyers to clear.         Its publication turned her into an outcast among many of the Hollywood elite.         ''At first it bothered me because I really didn't expect that kind of reaction,'' she said. ''I thought people had a sense of humor. I really did.         ''Understand, I wasn't a pariah because I was a drug-addicted, alcoholic, rotten person and not a good mother,'' she said. ''I was a pariah because I lit them with a harsh fluorescent light and rendered them as contemptible as they truly are.''         The book was criticized because Ms. Phillips recalled conversations from years before without the benefit of notes; she replied that she had a photographic memory. A harsher criticism was that the book discussed physical flaws of numerous people. Ms. Phillips said later that she had only one regret: referring to one woman as ''a city of flesh.''         In later years, Ms. Phillips said, she sometimes went to restaurants and accidentally met some of the people she had written about. She said they were polite, even friendly.         Ms. Phillips is survived by her daughter, of Los Angeles; her brother, Matthew Miller of Weston, Conn.; and her son-in-law, Modi Wiczyk of Los Angeles.         Her first book led Morton's, a popular movie industry hangout, to tell Ms. Phillips that she was unwelcome. But the restaurant soon rescinded its ban. Shortly before she died, Ms. Phillips recalled with a laugh that she had her daughter's 1999 wedding-rehearsal dinner at -- where else? -- Morton's. ''They had no problem taking my money,'' she said. ''That's Hollywood.''       
         Hildegard Knef, the actress whose career emerged from the dark realism of German filmmaking that followed Hitler's defeat and then grew to encompass Broadway, recordings and a best-selling memoir, died yesterday in Berlin. She was 76.         Ms. Knef, whose name was often anglicized as Neff in cast lists for films and plays, died of a lung infection, The Associated Press reported. A heavy smoker for most of her life, she had suffered from emphysema and, earlier, from breast cancer.         In her heyday, Ms. Knef was often described by entertainment columnists as the ''willowy blonde'' with the ''dusky voice'' and the ''generous mouth.'' She made at least 30 films in the United States and Europe, but had a singular triumph in New York in 1954 as Don Ameche's co-star in the Cole Porter hit ''Silk Stockings.'' She portrayed the stolid Soviet commissar Ninotchka (one of Greta Garbo's major film roles), who yields to romance on a spree in Paris. She won raves. Brooks Atkinson, the drama critic for The New York Times, called the show one of Porter's best and described Ms. Knef's stage transformation as the corrupted commissar ''an immensely skillful performance.''         Her success also made her more acceptable to an initially chilly Hollywood film community, which had held her suspect for wartime adventures, later described in her searing memoir, ''The Gift Horse'' (McGraw-Hill, 1971).         Hildegard Frieda Albertina Knef was born on Dec. 28, 1925, in Ulm, Germany, the daughter of Hans Theodor and Friede Auguste Knef. He was a decorated World War I veteran who died six months after her birth. Her mother moved to Berlin to take up factory work. ''As a child I was extraordinarily shy, not at all talkative,'' she recalled in her memoir.         At 17 she left school to become an apprentice animator with U.F.A. (Universum Film Company). After a successful screen test, she transferred to the State Film School at Babelsberg, a Berlin suburb, to study acting, ballet and elocution. Her first stage part was one line in the Deutsches Theater. Josef Goebbels, Hitler's propaganda minister, sent word that he wanted to meet her, but her friends kept her away from him.         Ms. Knef was bombed out of the family's apartment on New Year's Eve 1943. She was later wounded in an incendiary attack. In the last days of the war, Ewald von Demandowsky, a Nazi film director with whom she was in love, led her out of Berlin. On April 18, 1945, she wrote in her memoir, she donned a Wehrmacht uniform and the couple, armed with a submachine gun, pistol and hand grenades, tried to pass through Red Army lines to reach Allied territory. Captured and beaten, she was not discovered to be a woman until she was a prisoner of war in a camp in southeastern Germany among 40,000 German men.  Fellow prisoners helped her escape and make her way back to Berlin.         Before he was killed by his captors, Von Demandowsky directed Ms. Knef to go for protection to Viktor de Kowa, a well-known character actor, in Berlin. With permission from Soviet occupation authorities, de Kowa opened a theater with her as mistress of ceremonies. Soon she got a part in Marcel Pagnol's ''Marius,'' directed by Boleslaw Barlog, one of Germany's theater greats. He also directed her in plays by Shakespeare, Pagnol and George Abbott.         In 1946 Ms. Knef starred in Germany's first postwar movie, ''Murderers Are Among Us,'' in which she played a former concentration camp inmate returning home.         After a few years in Hollywood, she returned to Germany in 1950 to film ''Sinner,'' the story of a prostitute who falls in love with a painter who is going blind. The film caused a scandal when, in a scene of just a few seconds, Ms. Knef appeared nude. In a postwar Germany convulsed by guilt and shame, church leaders called for boycotts and thousands demonstrated against it.         ''A country that had Auschwitz and caused so much horror and then, a few years later, behaves in this manner because I was visible naked on the screen is utterly absurd,'' she wrote later. ''I had the scandal, the producers got the money.''         Among her other films were Anatole Litvak's ''Decision Before Dawn,'' a highly praised 1951 Hollywood film with Richard Basehart and Oskar Werner, about the last days of the war in Germany.         In ''The Snows of Kilimanjaro,'' (1952) she sang three Cole Porter songs. The composer saw the film and engaged her for ''Silk Stockings.'' She had had a bit of voice-  coaching as a teenager, but never considered herself a singer. Her delivery was described variously as ''mellow'' and ''rough and smoky.''         She began writing lyrics in the 1960's during a pause in her acting work and soon developed a successful concert and recording career.         Ms. Knef was married three times and divorced twice. Her first husband, Kurt Hirsch, was an American Army officer who took her to Hollywood in 1947. She later married David Anthony Palastranga, an actor and director, with whom she had a daughter, Christina. She is survived by her daughter and her third husband, Paul von Schell, according to The Associated Press.         Ms. Knef's later years were devoted to singing and writing. Returning to Europe after years in America she remarked, ''Everything when I arrived was under occupation by memories.''       
         Virginia Hamilton, an internationally recognized writer for children whose work celebrated the African-American experience as an essential component of American life, died yesterday in Dayton, Ohio. She was 65 and lived in Yellow Springs, Ohio.         The cause was breast cancer, said Kris Moran, director of publicity for Scholastic, Ms. Hamilton's publisher.         Ms. Hamilton, known privately by her married name, Virginia Hamilton Adoff, wrote more than 35 books in many genres that spanned picture books and folk stories, mysteries and science fiction, realistic novels and biography. Among her best-known works are ''The People Could Fly'' (1985), ''The Planet of Junior Brown'' (1971) and ''Many Thousand Gone: African Americans From Slavery to Freedom'' (1993).         She won a National Book Award in 1975 for her novel ''M. C. Higgins, the Great''; the book also received a Newbery award, the first to a black writer. In 1995 she became the first children's author to receive a MacArthur Foundation ''genius'' grant.         Woven into her books is a deep concern with memory, tradition and generational legacy, especially as they helped define the lives of American blacks from the days of slavery onward. Ms. Hamilton described her work as ''liberation literature.''         Virginia Esther Hamilton was born March 12, 1936. She grew up on the small farm in Yellow Springs that had been her family's since the 1850's;  she later returned there with her husband and children.         She came from a family of storytellers. Ms. Hamilton's grandfather Levi Perry was born a slave in Virginia and crossed the Ohio River to freedom. Once a year, she wrote, he gathered his children around him. ''Set down,'' he would say, ''and I will tell you about slavery and why I ran, so that it will never happen to you.'' Ms. Hamilton was named Virginia in remembrance of his flight.         After attending Antioch College and Ohio State University -- she lacked the money to complete her studies -- Ms. Hamilton moved to New York. There, while studying writing at the New School for Social Research, she met the poet Arnold Adoff, whom she married in 1960. Mr. Adoff survives her, as do two sisters, Nina Anthony, of Columbus, Ohio, and Barbara Davis, of Los Angeles; two brothers, William Hamilton, of Englewood, N.J., and Kenneth James Hamilton Jr., of Chula Vista, Calif.; a daughter, Leigh Hamilton Adoff, of Berlin, and a son, Jaime Levi Adoff, of Manhattan.         Ms. Hamilton's first book, ''Zeely,'' appeared in 1967. At the time the few children's books about black people were mainly ''problem'' novels, which threw into sharp relief issues like segregation and poverty.         ''Zeely'' was a radical departure. It was not that race was absent, but that it was so completely, unremarkably present. Ms. Hamilton forsook gritty urban drama for a pastoral tale of enchantment whose characters happened to be black. The novel told the story of a girl who, during a summer on her uncle's farm, is captivated by an enigmatic local woman she believes is a Watusi queen.         Among Ms. Hamilton's many honors were an Edgar Allan Poe Award, a Coretta Scott King Award, a Hans Christian Andersen Medal and an honorary doctorate from Ohio State.         Many of her recent books were devoted to the black oral tradition; she combed dusty archives for early manuscripts with long-forgotten songs, riddles and stories.         The fruits of her travels included ''The People Could Fly,'' which retells slaves' traditional tales in an accessible vernacular, without the ugly misspellings historically used to render black dialect. The title story recounts: ''The one called Driver cracked his whip over the slow ones to make them move faster. That whip was a slice-open cut of pain. So they did move faster. Had to.''         The book's carefully worded subtitle, ''American Black Folktales,'' was itself a political statement, Ms. Hamilton later recalled. Her editor had urged on her the more conventional  ''Black American Folktales.''         ''No,'' Ms. Hamilton replied. ''They're American first and black second.''       
         Annalee Whitmore Fadiman, a screenwriter, World War II correspondent and the author, with Theodore H. White, of the best seller ''Thunder Out of China,'' died yesterday in Captiva, Fla. She was 85.         Mrs. Fadiman, who as a member of the Hemlock Society supported a right to suicide, took her own life, said her daughter, Anne. Mrs. Fadiman had been suffering from breast cancer and Parkinson's disease.         A woman successful in several careers, Mrs. Fadiman spent much of her life defying the conventions of professions dominated by men. Nancy Sorel, in her book ''The Women Who Wrote the War,'' called Mrs. Fadiman's career ''a real-life movie.'' Sidney Skolsky, the 1940's Hollywood columnist, called her ''the girl reporter of this war.''         Annalee Whitmore was born on May 27, 1916, on the kitchen table of her family's home in Price, Utah, the eldest of four children born to Leland Whitmore, a bank president who built and flew airplanes as a hobby, and Anne Sharp Whitmore, who later became a librarian at the main branch of the New York Public Library.         When Mr. Whitmore lost his job during the Depression, the family  moved to California and struggled to make ends meet. Ms. Whitmore attended Piedmont High School and was admitted to Stanford University in 1933 after scoring highest in the state on a college entrance exam.  She graduated in 1937, having served as the first woman to be managing editor of the Stanford Daily newspaper.         She took a $75-a-month secretarial job at the Agricultural Adjustment Administration in San Francisco, but quit after a year when her boss asked her to type part of the manuscript of a memoir he had written.         In 1938, she moved to Los Angeles and joined the secretarial pool at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. When she heard that MGM needed a film to occupy Judy Garland between ''The Wizard of Oz'' and ''Babes in Arms,'' she wrote a treatment in a single weekend and became the co-writer of ''Andy Hardy Meets Debutante''(1940), with Garland and Mickey Rooney.         With several more screenplay credits, she was offered a seven-year contract by MGM, but she dreamed of reporting in China, where war was already raging. The War Department allowed no female correspondents in China at that time, so in 1941 she landed a job as the Far East representative of a relief agency. Once in Chungking, writing speeches for Madame Chiang Kai-shek, she won a reporting job with Liberty magazine.         She married Melville Jacoby, a Time magazine correspondent she had first met when they were both Stanford undergraduates. Keeping barely a step ahead of the advancing Japanese forces after Pearl Harbor, they eventually withdrew to Brisbane, Australia. Mr. Jacoby was killed at 25 in an airfield accident near Darwin.         In 1944, Theodore H. White, the Time correspondent (he had been a close friend of Mr. Jacoby), finally persuaded his boss, Henry Luce, to seek War Department accreditation for Ms. Whitmore, so that she could join Mr. White in Chungking. She collaborated with him on ''Thunder Out of China,'' about China's role in the war, the strengths and weaknesses of the Kuomintang and the Communists, and the country's future. The book is still in print.         After the war, Ms. Whitmore wrote articles, lectured widely and appeared on the radio quiz show ''Information Please,'' where she met her second husband, Clifton Fadiman, the program's M.C. and the book reviewer for The New Yorker.         They were married in 1950, and had two children. She is survived by her daughter, of Massachusetts; a son, Kim, of Wyoming; a sister, Carol Whitmore of California; and two grandchildren. Mr. Fadiman died in 1999.       
         Mary Stuart, a veteran actress and pioneer of soap operas who spent 35 years as the star of one daytime series built around her, died on Thursday at her home in New York. She was 76.         She died after a stroke, but had been ill with gastric cancer and bone cancer, her family said.         Legions of fans lived with and felt they knew her two most famous characters, Joanne Gardner Barron Tate Vincente Tourneur on ''Search for Tomorrow,'' and Meta Bauer on ''The Guiding Light.''         Ms. Stuart, whose original name was Mary Houchins, was born in Miami and grew up in Tulsa, Okla. She started performing in early childhood. When she was 9, Count Basie's orchestra came through town, and held a contest to find a young female singer to perform with them. They chose Ms. Stuart, and she sang ''Little Girl Blue'' at two of their shows, said her husband, Wolfgang Neumann, an architect. The shows were late, so the band provided a cot backstage so she could sleep between sets.         The story of her rise to stardom resembles a Hollywood fantasy. At 17 she hitchhiked to New York, working at various jobs to support herself. For a little while she was a booking agent for an airline. ''Her sense of geography was absolutely abysmal,'' Mr. Neumann said. ''She didn't last long there.''         She became a hat-check and cigarette girl at the Roosevelt Hotel, where she met the film producer Joe Pasternak, who offered her a screen test. Her nerves got the better of her at the audition, her husband said, and Mr. Pasternak reportedly told her: ''You can't sing, you can't walk, but there is something that you have. Let's find out what it is.''         She spent the next few years working in movies in Hollywood, mostly in small parts, but sometimes with an icon of 1940's cinema. She appeared in more than 20 films, including ''The Girl From Jones Beach'' with Ronald Reagan, ''The Adventures of Don Juan'' with Errol Flynn and ''This Time for Keeps'' with Esther Williams.         After a few years, she returned to New York. ''She realized she wasn't cut out for Hollywood,'' her husband said. ''It was too ruthless.''         In 1951, she won the role of Jo in a new CBS soap opera, ''Search for Tomorrow,'' and played the long-suffering Joanne until 1986, when the show, which had moved to NBC, went off the air.         When not acting, Ms. Stuart read to children in the public schools of New York as part of a program called Book PALS (Performing Artists for Literacy in Schools), a program of the Screen Actors Guild Foundation to encourage children to read for pleasure. She started the New York chapter of the program in 1992. She also started a a Reading Club in 1996 for 4th and 5th graders in six schools. Today, more than 3,300 children in 10 schools are members. Nationally, the program is in 18 cities.         Her character on ''Search for Tomorrow'' endured many hardships and husbands, but remained noble and dignified throughout them, and broke new ground along the way. She was the first daytime actress to have her pregnancy written into the plot. The producers even filmed Ms. Stuart at the hospital after she gave birth to her son in 1956.         ''They filmed her in her hospital bed, to satisfy the fans and let them share in her happiness,'' said Mary Alice Dwyer-Dobbin, executive in charge of Procter & Gamble Productions.         Her son's career on the show was short-lived, however. Within a few days his character was killed off in an accident, much to the horror of his mother and the viewers. ''She really played the death of her son,'' said her daughter, Cynthia, ''and it was too painful for viewers to watch.''         Ms. Stuart was married twice before. In addition to her husband, daughter and son, Jeffrey Krolik of California, she is survived by two grandchildren.         For some of her fans her character was real. ''It was just like fam√¨ly,'' said Theresa Cristalli, who watched ''Search for Tomorrow''  from the very beginning. ''You keep watching day after day. I got hooked on them.''         Ms. Stuart was as loyal to her fans as they were to her. She responded to as much of her fan mail as she could, her daughter said. She even befriended some; she invited Ms. Cristalli and a friend to view the last taping of the show in 1986, and they kept in touch through cards and letters over the years.         Correction:  March 6, 2002, Wednesday  An obituary of the soap opera star Mary Stuart on Sunday misstated her age. She was 75, not 76.       
         Esther Afua Ocloo, who as a young woman turned a gift of less than a dollar into 12 jars of marmalade -- which she sold for a profit -- and went on to become one of Ghana's leading entrepreneurs and a prominent exponent of the role of women in economic development, died on Feb. 8 in Accra, Ghana. She was 83.         Her husband, Stephen, said she  died of pneumonia in Accra Military Hospital.         As the first chairwoman of Women's World Banking, Ms. Ocloo was one of the pioneers of microlending, the financing of homespun businesses, predominantly run by women, through very small loans, sometimes as little as $50. If a business prospers and the loan is repaid -- as more than 98 percent are -- then a larger loan is made available.         Large lending institutions give microlending institutions, like Women's World Banking, big loans of, say, $5 million. The money is then parceled out in small loans, at interest rates slightly higher than normal commercial bank rates, for enterprises as simple as drying fish.         Nancy Barry, president of Women's World Banking, said that 25 million people, three-quarters of them women, had received microloans in more than 40 less-developed countries. Half the loans are from Women's World Banking.         The idea was born at the 1975 Mexico City conference that proclaimed the United Nations Decade for Women. Ms. Ocloo found that ideas she had been developing with women in Ghana were also percolating elsewhere. The premise was simple: more than education, health care or family planning, women in poor countries need money in their pockets.         The other early leaders in the movement were Michaela Walsh, a New York investment banker, and Ela Bhatt, founder of a cooperative bank for illiterate women in India. They and several allies founded Women's World Banking in 1979 with Ms. Ocloo as chairwoman.         Ms. Barry said that concentrating on women made sense because they are discriminated against in borrowing; they do the majority of artisanal work and much of the farming, and they have a keener sense of the interdependence of generations.         Ms. Ocloo, in a speech in 1990, gave a starkly practical explanation.         ''Women must know that the strongest power in the world is economic power,'' she said. ''You cannot go and be begging to your husband for every little thing, but at the moment, that's what the majority of our women do.''         Esther Afua Nkulenu was born in  Peki-Dzake in the Volta region of Ghana on April 18, 1919. Her parents were poor farmers, but she was able to attend high school with the help of scholarships offered to young women by Cadbury, the chocolate company, which was a major buyer of Ghana's cocoa crop.         Her mother, with tears in her eyes, sent her off to Accra with just a sixpence. After graduating, she lived with relatives in the city. An aunt gave her 10 shillings, worth less than one United States dollar. She bought sugar, firewood, oranges and 12 jars, and made marmalade jam, which she sold for a shilling a jar.         ''I was ridiculed by all my classmates, who saw me hawking marmalade on the street like an uneducated street vendor,'' rather than seeking an office job, she said.         But she plowed her profits back into the business. She also took some of her marmalade to her old high school and won a contract to supply the entire school. Soon, school officials asked her to supply orange juice from orange trees on its grounds.         She next got a contract to supply juice to the military, but lacked the necessary funds to produce it. Though she had no collateral, she persuaded a bank to give her a loan on the basis of the contract. The result was her company, Nkulenu Industries, which grew to produce products like canned tomatoes and soup bases.         After six years, she had saved enough money to go to Britain to study food technology, preservation, nutrition and agriculture. She also learned leatherwork and lampshade-making in the hope of sharing the skills with rural women back home.         Even as she continued running her own company upon her return, she devoted more and more of her time to improving women's economic situation. For example, she established her own program on a farm to train women in agriculture, preparing and preserving food products and making handicrafts.         She paid for the program in part with her half of the Africa Prize, a $100,000 award she split with Olusegun Obasanjo, the current president of Nigeria, in 1990. It was presented by the Hunger Project for their leadership in working to end hunger in Africa.         She liked to keep things simple, as when she taught business management skills to women involved in cooking and selling food on the streets.         ''I have taught them to cost the things they sell and determine their profits,'' she said. ''You know what we found? We found that a woman selling rice and stew on the side of the street is making more money than most women in office jobs -- but they are not taken seriously.''         Ms. Ocloo, who always wore bright African clothes and loved to cook traditional meals, preferred to be known as Auntie Ocloo, in the Ghanaian tradition. She usually began meetings of bankers and others with a prayer, and often ended them with a song: ''We Are Wonderful.''         The day she entered the hospital she gave a speech urging women to carry on her campaign for micro-lending. Days before she died, she was on the phone from her hospital bed to governmental officials arguing that microloans, rather than grants, should be specified in Ghana's new budget.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by her sister, Georgina Nkulenu; her daughter, Vincentia Canacco; her sons Vincent Malm, Christian Biassey and Stephen Jr., and six grandchildren.         She once said her children complained that the women she trained competed against her.         ''I don't listen,'' she said. ''My main goal is to help my fellow women. If they make better marmalade than me, I deserve the competition.''       
         Irene Worth, a consummate actress of the English stage celebrated for her performances in the widest diversity of classical and contemporary roles from Shakespeare to Samuel Beckett and including Chekhov, Ibsen, Shaw and Edward Albee, died on Sunday in New York.         She was 85, according to ''Who's Who in the Theater,'' but her sister, Carol Johnson of Santa Monica, Calif., said she was 86.         Ms. Worth suffered a stroke at a post office near her apartment on the West Side of Manhattan and was rushed to a hospital, said Ms. Johnson, who was called by the hospital and flew to New York.         Ms. Worth (whose first name was pronounced eye-REENY) won three Tony awards for her roles on Broadway, as best actress as Miss Alice in Mr. Albee's ''Tiny Alice'' in 1965 and as Alexandra del Lago in a revival of Tennessee Williams's ''Sweet Bird of Youth'' in 1976 and as best featured actress as Grandma Kurnitz in Neil Simon's ''Lost in Yonkers'' in 1991.         Fiercely independent and articulate, Ms. Worth created a career that was daring as well as highly individual, and it was filled with memorable moments. She earned the highest praise as Celia in the premiere of ''The Cocktail Party'' by T. S. Eliot, as Arkadina in ''The Seagull,'' as Hedda Gabler and as Goneril to Paul Scofield's King Lear in Peter Brook's production, repeating her role in the Brook film. At other points in her career, she played Rosalind, Portia, Desdemona, Lady Macbeth, Volumnia and many others.         With equal agility, she played heroines and villainesses -- and women with various shadings in between. In her virtuosity she became a complete actress, an artist in tune with her time -- and with other times as well. She was as much at home in gowns (and crowns) as she was in contemporary clothes.         Was there any great role that she missed? At one time, she and Joseph Papp spoke about the possibility of her playing King Lear. She was, he said, one of the few American actors with the depth and power for that role. In the end, however, she restricted herself to playing female roles, seeking out the most complex characters in dramatic literature.         With a boldness unmatched by many of her acting contemporaries, she continually challenged herself in plays by modern writers like Beckett, Mr. Albee, Williams and David Hare. She had a long artistic relationship with Mr. Brook, starring opposite John Gielgud in Mr. Brook's production of Seneca's ''Oedipus'' and traveling with the director and his ensemble to Iran with ''Orghast.'' As Mr. Brook said, ''Having mastered with dazzling authority all the facets of her art, she joined us with the total commitment she always brought to her work.''         Also active in the commercial theater, she starred in Lillian Hellman's ''Toys in the Attic,'' Mr. Simon's ''Lost in Yonkers'' and Noel Coward's ''Suite in Three Keys.''         She combined an eloquent voice, which could rise from a purr to a cry of passion, with a striking physical presence. On stage and off, she had an elegance that made her a natural for playing queens, which she frequently did. Her beauty was untarnished (and unvarnished), even late in her life, and she also retained her sense of style and on occasion was featured in fashion articles.         Highly literate, she was a self-educated theatrical scholar. She often appeared in literary evenings, drawn from the work of writers like Turgenev, Edith Wharton, Virginia Woolf, Edith Sitwell and George Sand, and she frequently created and performed evenings of poetry.         In fact, she did so many solo performances that it was suggested that she preferred to act alone on stage, but that was not so, as Gielgud, Guinness and so many other actors could testify. Last year she and Mr. Scofield appeared in London in Carol Rocamora's play ''I Take Your Hand in Mine,'' based on the love letters of Chekhov and his wife, Olga Knipper.         Her career, which spanned almost 60 years, was filled with honors (Tonys, Obies, Evening Standard awards as well as an honorary commander of the British Empire) and love letters from admiring critics and fellow actors. As Gielgud wrote forthrightly in one of his books, ''She is a great artist as well as one of my most devoted friends.''         In the great artistic tradition, Ms. Worth invented herself. Born Harriet Abrams in Lincoln, Neb., she moved to California at an early age. Her sister said her name was changed at the suggestion of a Hollywood producer.         After graduating from the University of California at Los Angeles, she was briefly a schoolteacher and then came to New York. In 1942 she auditioned for Elisabeth Bergner and toured with her in ''Escape Me Never.'' The next year she made her Broadway debut with Ms. Bergner in the thriller ''The Two Mrs. Carrolls.''         At Ms. Bergner's suggestion she then went to London where she studied with Elsie Fogerty, who taught her to speak ''stage English,'' as if to-the-manner -- and manor -- born. She was soon acting on the London stage in ''The Play's the Thing'' by Ferenc Molnar and then acted so frequently with the Old Vic and the Royal Shakespeare Company (and later the National Theater) that theatergoers assumed she was English rather than American.         In 1950 she returned to Broadway with Alec Guinness in ''The Cocktail Party.'' In his review in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson said that as ''the other woman,'' she gave ''a remarkably skillful, passionate and perceptive performance.'' This was her breakthrough performance. Looking back on it, she said, ''The role of Celia was just right for me at the time -- vulnerable, idealistic, dedicated, easily disillusioned.''         In 1953 she was a founding member of the Shakespeare Festival Theater in Stratford, Ontario, appearing opposite Guinness as Helena in ''All's Well That Ends Well.'' In his review, Mr. Atkinson said that Ms. Worth ''gives another superb performance that overflows with loveliness, devotion, ceremony and modest guile.''         From then on, she split her career between London and New York, while also performing in Canada and, later, making her adventurous journeys with Mr. Brook. In 1957 she joined the Phoenix Theater in New York, playing the title role in Schiller's ''Mary Stuart'' opposite Eva Le Gallienne as Queen Elizabeth.         Throughout her career she and Gielgud remained colleagues and close friends. In 1964 they starred in ''Tiny Alice,'' Ms. Worth as the mysterious benefactor Miss Alice, Gielgud as the innocent lay brother Julian. In a highly dramatic seduction scene, Ms. Worth was supposed to open her beautiful Mainbocher gown and, seemingly naked, embrace Gielgud. By his own admission, he was embarrassed. In a moment of panic, she said to him, ''Oh, John, just imagine you and I suddenly got married.'' Once when he was asked about the scene, Gielgud said, ''I say to myself, thank God, it's just dear old Irene.''         It was with Mr. Brook as director that she and Gielgud triumphed in Seneca's ''Oedipus'' in London in 1968. Gielgud was Oedipus and Ms. Worth was Jocasta, who ends the play impaled on a golden spike. This was, in Ms. Worth's words, ''one of the most profound productions of our generation,'' an observation that was echoed by critics.         She starred as Madame Ranevskaya in Andrei Serban's innovative production of ''The Cherry Orchard'' for Mr. Papp at Lincoln Center. Speaking about that production in an interview in the Times, she said that the ''finest climate for a play,'' that play and others, was in rehearsal. ''That's when your imagination is at its highest,'' she said. ''You have to imagine everything. You can then create endless worlds.''         The actress had a continuing kinship with Chekhov. Often she performed in his plays, and in 2001 when Mike Nichols directed ''The Seagull'' in Central Park, she wrote an essay about Chekhov in the theater's program. ''A play by Chekhov is like a summer's day,'' she said, ''but hearts also break in the sunshine.''         In 1979, again with Mr. Serban and Mr. Papp, she explored the world of Beckett, played Winnie in ''Happy Days.'' She said that Winnie, who begins the play buried up to her waist in a mound of earth, was like no other character she had ever played. She is, she said, ''the closest to Charlie's tramp that you can get.'' In ''Happy Days'' she revealed another dimension to her seemingly limitless talent. As she said: ''I have to do what Beckett wants. Just throw caution to the wind.''         In 1990 in a tribute to Beckett at the Almeida Theater in London, she gave a luminous reading of the television play, ''Eh Joe,'' to a throbbing background score by Earl Kim. Ms. Worth seemed to be singing Beckett.         While other actors and actresses of her generation retired or reduced the number of their performances, she always maintained her zest for work and for experiencing diverse cultural activities. During her last days, Ms. Worth kept up her usual peripatetic pace. She went to the Brooklyn Academy of Music to see Mark Morris, saw ''War and Peace'' at the Metropolitan Opera House and had tickets for the opening of Mr. Albee's new play ''The Goat, or Who Is Sylvia?'' on Sunday.         When Ms. Worth did not show up, her guests for the evening telephoned her apartment, and Ms. Worth's sister told them of her death. In addition to her sister, she is survived by her brother Luke Evans of Los Angeles.         She worked in films, including ''The Scapegoat,'' ''Eyewitness,'' ''Orders to Kill,'' ''Nicholas and Alexandra'' and the movie versions of ''King Lear'' and ''Lost in Yonkers,'' and she played Clytemnestra on television. But theater remained the center of her life.         Throughout, she was devoted to the art of acting, and that meant performing on stage. Once she said, ''Nobody could stop a dancer dancing, a singer singing or an actor acting. It is a primeval force.''       
         Barbara Grizzuti Harrison, who emerged as a popular, prolific writer of keenly observed nonfiction with a 1978 book about the dozen years she spent as a Jehovah's Witness, died on Wednesday at a hospice in Manhattan. She was 67 and lived in the Park Slope neighborhood of Brooklyn.         The cause was chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, said her daughter, Anna Harrison. She once wrote that for years she smoked six packs of cigarettes a day.         The turning point in her life and career was her decision, at 22, to leave the Jehovah's Witnesses, which forbade a college education. What followed was a successful self-education and a blossoming into a multifaceted writer of literate travel books, many essays and reviews, and a novel.         With ''Visions of Glory: A History and a Memory of Jehovah's Witnesses'' (Simon & Schuster), she became nationally known; her later work, mostly nonfiction, usually received excellent reviews.         In The New York Times Book Review, Vivian Gornick said ''Visions of Glory'' was ''quite well written, contains a mass of absorbing information, and the personality of its author is extremely appealing.''         Ms. Harrison was converted to the Jehovah's Witnesses faith by her mother when she was 9; she went door to door carrying its message. At 19, she went to live and work at its world headquarters, the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society in Brooklyn Heights.         After three years there, she renounced the faith and left.         ''Visions of Glory'' mixes her autobiography with detailed historical research. She portrays the religion as racist, sexist and totalitarian, but also details members' kindness to one another, their care for the elderly and their courage in the face of persecution.         Barbara Grizzuti was born in Jamaica, Queens, on Sept. 14, 1934. She grew up in various Brooklyn neighborhoods, mainly Bensonhurst. Her father, a printer, and her brother, Richard, did not become Jehovah's Witnesses, creating a deep fault line in the household. She wrote of an extremely disorganized family, and of a father who sexually abused her and once tried to kill her.         As a young teenager, Barbara already knew she wanted to be a writer. When asked in an interview in ''Contemporary Authors'' how she could reconcile this ambition with the tenets of the Jehovah's Witnesses, she suggested that the religion's images of the watery creation of the world and its imminent bloody destruction stimulated her imagination.         ''I think the two things were going on simultaneously: the religion encouraged something it was bound to squash,'' she said.         In her autobiography, ''An Accidental Autobiography'' (Houghton Mifflin, 1996), she wrote, ''I read Sartre in my late teens and made the mistake of taking him seriously.''         After leaving the Jehovah's Witnesses, she moved to the East Village and worked as a secretary at a publishing house and at the American Committee on Africa. There she met W. Dale Harrison, whom she married. He took a job with CARE, and they lived in Libya, India and Guatemala.         They returned to Brooklyn with their two children, and she wrote that she thought of herself as ''one of those furtive, silly housewives with a novel under her apron.''         Her first book, ''Unlearning the Lie: Sexism in School'' (Liveright, 1969), grew out of the children's experiences with efforts to quell sexism at what was then the Woodward Park School in Brooklyn.         The Harrisons divorced in 1968 after eight years of marriage.         Ms. Harrison was an early writer for Ms. Magazine. Often described as a gifted interviewer, she contributed to many other national magazines and newspapers. She was noted for her humor and her strong opinions; she once called the highly regarded novelist Joan Didion a ''neurasthenic Cher.''         Her other books included ''Italian Days'' (Weidenfeld & Nicolson, 1989), an impressionistic and literary travel book about Italy that won the American Book Award, and a novel, ''Foreign Bodies'' (Doubleday, 1984).         Ms. Harrison is survived by her daughter, who lives in Bethlehem, Conn., and her son, Josh Harrison of Manhattan.         Her daughter said her mother returned to the religion of her early childhood, Roman Catholicism, in her 40's, partly as a result of interviewing Dorothy Day of the Catholic Worker movement and partly because she hoped to meet in heaven the high school English teacher who had first appreciated her writing.       
         Indra Devi, the daughter of European nobility who introduced the ancient discipline of yoga to the Kremlin leadership, Hollywood stars like Gloria Swanson and even students in India, died on Thursday in Buenos Aires. She was 102.         In Buenos Aires, where she had lived for several years, she formed a yoga foundation that was named after her.         Known to her followers as Mataji, which means mother, she was a student of Sri Tirumalai Krishnamacharya, the legendary guru who gained worldwide attention for stopping his heartbeat for two minutes. At a time when yoga was almost an exclusively masculine pursuit, she was his first female student.         Like two of his other students, B.K.S. Ayengar and K. Pattabhi Jois, both men, she took his essential teachings and built a style of yoga accessible to Westerners. It was characterized by gentleness.         ''She herself became a kind of seminal figure,'' said Phil Catalto, a senior editor of Yoga Journal. ''She was an ambassador of yoga.''         She was born Eugenie Peterson in Riga, Latvia, on May 12, 1899. Her father was a Swedish bank director, and her mother was a Russian noblewoman. She attended drama school in Moscow as a girl, and escaped to Berlin with her mother when the Communists came to power in 1917.         In Berlin, she became an actress and dancer. Her fascination with India began at 15, when she read a book by the poet Rabindranath Tagore, then some books on yoga. In 1927, she sailed for India.         Under the stage name Indra Devi, she became a rising star in Indian films. In 1930, she married Jan Strakaty, commercial attach√© to the Czechoslovak Consulate in Bombay. Through him, she met the Maharaja and Maharini of Mysore, who maintained a yoga school in their palace where Sri Krishnamacharya taught.         She asked the master for a lesson. He refused, on the grounds that she was a Westerner and a woman. But she persuaded the royal couple to prevail upon the guru, and he reluctantly consented, said Fernando Pages Ruiz, a freelance writer who interviewed her.         Rather than the cursory lessons he had at first intended, Sri Krishnamacharya taught her for a year. When he learned that her husband was to be transferred to China, he trained her to be a yoga teacher.         In Shanghai, she taught what was thought to be the first yoga class in modern China, Mr. Ruiz said. Her husband, she said in a 1996 interview in Yoga Journal, was ''dead set against'' her yoga courses. It was also the time of the Japanese occupation.         For a time she held five classes of 25 students a day in the bedroom of Madame Chiang Kaishek, wife of the nationalist leader and a new yoga enthusiast.         After the war, she returned to India and wrote her first book, believed to be the first book on yoga written by a Westerner to be published in India. She also became known as the first Westerner to teach yoga there.         Her husband, meanwhile, had been ordered back to Czechoslovakia, where he died in 1946.         She returned to Shanghai to recover their belongings and was unsure whether to go to India or the United States. She bought tickets for both destinations and resolved to take whichever ship sailed first. America won.         She found her way to Hollywood, arriving in January 1947. She discovered ready students among movie stars, who found yoga's breathing and relaxation techniques useful to their work. Her students included Miss Swanson, to whom she dedicated one of her 12 books, Robert Ryan, Greta Garbo, Jennifer Jones and the violinist Yehudi Menuhin.         She taught yoga for at Elizabeth Arden's spas in Maine and Arizona, but refused to join the staff.         In 1953, she married Dr. Siegrid Knauer, who preferred preventive medicine to antibiotics. After becoming an American citizen, she legally changed her name to Indra Devi.         Dr. Knauer bought her a 24-room estate in Tecate, Mexico, at which to give training courses for yoga teachers. He died in 1977.         In 1960, India's ambassador to Moscow arranged for her to meet the top Soviet leaders, including Aleksei Kosygin, the premier, Andrei Gromyko, the foreign minister, and Anastas Mikoyan, chairman of the Supreme Soviet. After she spoke to them of the benefits of yoga, it was legalized in Russia.         In 1966, she became captivated by the teachings of the guru Satya Sai Baba. This resulted in a new form of yoga that she called Sai Yoga.         She traveled and taught around the world. In 1982, she visited Argentina, where her popularity snowballed after a single television appearance. She formed a foundation to spread her yoga methods. At the time of her death, it operated six studios.         ''She was like a national treasure,'' Mr. Ruiz said. ''It wasn't just yoga, she was known by the population at large.''         She had no children by either marriage. A woman at her foundation who identified herself only as Anna said that she had an adopted daughter named Rosita.       
         Niki de Saint Phalle, a Franco-American artist internationally known for her colorful, monumental, cartoonlike sculptures and environments, died on Tuesday in San Diego, Calif. She was 71.         The cause was pulmonary failure after an illness of several months, said Harry Mathews, the writer and her first husband.         A heroine to feminism before the modern movement even emerged, Ms. de Saint Phalle first made her mark in Paris in the early 60's when she was associated with the Nouveaux R√©alistes, a group of avant-gardists that included the sculptors Christo, Arman and Jean Tinguely. Their antic, absurdist works challenged conventional ideas about art-making in ways that echoed the earlier Dada movement.         Ms. de Saint Phalle became notorious for what she called ''target paintings,'' at which darts were thrown, and then for actual ''shooting paintings'' and sculptures. In galleries, she would use a .22-caliber rifle to shoot at plaster sculptures in which she had embedded bags of paint, causing color to splatter all over.         Ms. de Saint Phalle went on to produce a far different kind of art, an amalgam of Pop, Surrealism, Folk and outsider art that she prolifically realized in sculptures, paintings, prints and large public installations. Inspired in the mid-60's by a visit from the wife of Larry Rivers, Clarice Rivers, who was then pregnant, Ms. de Saint Phalle created the first of what would become an extensive population of ''Nanas.'' (Nana is a mildly rude French term for woman, comparable to broad.) They were bulbous, archetypal maternal figures like Mexican pi√±atas painted in bold colors and decorated with crisp, cartoon outlines.         In contrast with the aggressive Conceptualism of her early performance works, the art for which she became best known seemed to flow from an endlessly fertile, visionary imagination.         The Nanas gave birth to legions of fanciful humanoids, animals, plants and monsters and a trend away from the refinement of individual objects toward the creation of whole, fantastic worlds that would be most fully achieved in ambitious public works like Surrealistic amusement parks. Made of cement and produced on a gigantic scale, the Nanas became houses that visitors could enter, and surrounding grounds became teeming, part-organic, part-architectural mazes. At once avant-garde and populist, Ms. de Saint Phalle's art had the unusual ability to appeal to a wide range of viewers, from art-world professionals to children.         In the late 1970's, on acreage in southwestern Tuscany made available by wealthy friends, Ms. de Saint Phalle began her most ambitious project, a sprawling sculpture garden featuring 22 large sculptures based on the fortune-telling Tarot cards. With its wildly grotesque forms decorated by ceramic tiles, glass and mirrors, it calls to mind the architecture of Antonio Gaud√≠, whose work made a lasting impression on Ms. de Saint Phalle when she first encountered it in the 1950's. Financing it in part through the sale of a perfume called Niki de Saint Phalle, which she created for the Jacqueline Cochran company, Ms. de Saint Phalle worked on the Tarot Garden for 20 years. It opened to the public in 1998.         Catherine Marie-Agn√®s Fal de Saint Phalle was born into a wealthy family on Oct. 29, 1930, at Neuilly-sur-Seine, a Paris suburb, but was partly raised in New York, where her parents moved after the crash of 1929, and educated at the Brearley School, among several others. She told of being thrown out of Brearley for painting the fig leaves on the school artworks red.         At 18 she eloped with Mr. Mathews, and two years later the couple moved to France, where she began to paint after a nervous breakdown at age 23. She was mostly a self-taught artist. Her first solo exhibition took place in St. Gallen, Switzerland, in 1956, but she did not begin to show her work regularly until 1961.         Divorced from Mr. Mathews in 1960, she began a relationship with Jean Tinguely, the Swiss sculptor known for his kinetic, mechanical sculptures. They were married in 1971 and she collaborated with him on many projects. Although they lived separately after their marriage, their partnership lasted until his death in 1991. Ms. de Saint Phalle returned to the United States in 1994 to settle in La Jolla, in San Diego, partly because of her frail health.         In addition to producing public works in cities from Jerusalem to San Diego, Ms. de Saint Phalle had many museum exhibitions. The Nassau County Museum of Fine Arts in New York assembled her first American retrospective in 1987, and a larger retrospective was organized by the Kunst und Austellunghalle in Bonn in 1992. In 1994, an institution dedicated to her work, the Niki Museum, opened in Nasu, Japan. In 2000 she won a $140,000 Praemium Imperiale Award given by the Japan Art Association.         Ms. de Saint Phalle is survived by a brother, John de Saint Phalle, of Florida; a daughter, Laura Duke, of Paris; a son, Philip Mathews, of New York; three grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.       
         Zypora Spaisman, who did everything to keep Yiddish theater alive, from producing plays to selling tickets to sweeping floors to her great love, acting (including not a few Jewish-mother roles), died on May 18 in Manhattan. She was 86.         The Yiddish stage was the center of Mrs. Spaisman's life, from her girlhood in Poland to a Soviet labor camp to Paris and Montreal and finally to New York, where she became a principal force in maintaining the nation's only surviving Yiddish theater, the Folksbiene (People's Stage). She seems never to have made a penny for her efforts.         ''Nearly single-handedly, she led the pack in the fight to keep Yiddish theater going,'' said Eleanor Reissa, the artistic director of the Folksbiene, for which Mrs. Spaisman was once in charge of productions.         In 1914 there were 14 Yiddish theaters in New York, and avant-garde movements like naturalism, expressionism and Stanislavsky's Method often found their first expression there. But the combined effects of the Holocaust, the diffusion and assimilation of American Jews and the aging of the immigrant population gnawed away at audience numbers.         A bitter, often-quoted joke in Yiddish circles is that each time one of the Yiddish theater's remaining audience members dies, a seat is removed so it will not look empty. But dwindling numbers only heightened Mrs. Spaisman's determination.         ''My whole life has been about preserving the Yiddish language,'' she said in an interview. ''Hitler didn't kill it. Neither did Stalin.''         Zypora Tanenbaum was born in Lublin, Poland, on Jan. 2, 1916. By the time she was 10, she was participating in town and school dramatic presentations in both Polish and Yiddish, a language that mingles Old High German and Hebrew, with Slavic and Romance elements.         She graduated from nursing school, became a midwife in 1933, and married Joseph Spaisman in 1938. When the Nazis invaded Poland in 1939, she saw her sister shot. The Spaismans fled to the Russian part of Poland, and from there were taken to a labor camp in the Urals.         Mrs. Spaisman delivered more than 1,000 babies while in the camp. Each Sunday, she would organize a Yiddish theatrical presentation in a different barracks, said her son, Ben-Ami, who survives her, along with his two children.         When Mrs. Spaisman returned to Poland after the war, she learned that all the members of her family were dead, as were most of the country's Jews. She acted in the Yiddish theater in Lodz, working with the great Yiddish comedians Shimen Dzigan and Yisroel Shumakher. In Paris and Montreal, where she waited with her husband and son for permission to enter the United States, she also worked in the theater.         The Spaismans came to New York in 1955, and she sought stage work at the Hebrew Actors Union, but was rebuffed. So she went to the Folksbiene, which she had heard about from a Polish director.         The company, which opened in 1915, is now the oldest continually performing Yiddish theater in the world. Although Mrs. Spaisman never worked with the renowned actress Molly Picon, she appeared with many of the other luminaries of the Yiddish stage.         She often created characters that combined surface humor with inner wisdom. The publication Back Stage called her ''the grande dame,'' and The Jewish Week referred to her as ''a national treasure.'' Reviewing ''The Land of Dreams'' in The New York Times in 1989, Richard F. Shepard called her ''the mistress of the glumly comic look and acerbic tongue.''         Mrs. Spaisman's fans seemed to respond to her performances as if the characters she played were real. Once when she portrayed a shabbily dressed town gossip, two women met her outside the theater with new stockings and blouses.         ''You make us laugh, you make us cry,'' they told Mrs. Spaisman, according to The Jerusalem Post. ''You're so poorly dressed, we brought you these things.''         In 1989, Mrs. Spaisman appeared in the movie ''Enemies: A Love Story,'' directed by Paul Mazursky and starring Anjelica Huston and Ron Silver. During her acting career, she won an Obie Award, a Drama Desk Award and a New York City People's Choice Award.         Mrs. Spaisman, who lived in Manhattan, supported herself by working as a recreation director at the Jewish Institute for Geriatric Care, first in Manhattan and then in New Hyde Park, N.Y. On a typical day, she left for work at 7 and returned at 5 to cook dinner for her husband and son. Then she went to rehearsal. Performances were on weekends.         Mr. Spaisman died in 1997. In 1998, Mrs. Spaisman was shocked when the Folksbiene board eliminated her position -- executive producer -- to hire younger producers attuned to younger audiences. She refused to retire gracefully.         ''They wanted to give me a nice party,'' she said in an interview in The Times in 2000, ''to get money in my name and give it to the Folksbiene. And I should step down. I have to be such an idiot?''         Ms. Reissa said she wanted Mrs. Spaisman to remain as a valuable consultant; Mrs. Spaisman refused. With her death, the three people who long steered the Folksbiene are now gone: Benjamin Schechter, managing director, died in 1994, and Morris Adler, president, died in December at 107.         After what Mrs. Spaisman insisted on viewing as her dismissal, she took the Folksbiene's mailing list with her and started a new Yiddish theater company, the Yiddish Public Theater.         She cast herself in a starring role in November 2000 in its first and so far only production: ''Grine Felder'' (''Green Fields''). A review in Back Stage said that in her role as a mother, she ''proves that passing time cannot deter a real trouper.''       
         Antonia Pantoja, an advocate for New Yorkers of Puerto Rican origin whose educational organization Aspira won a landmark lawsuit in the 70's that brought bilingual education to New York City public schools, died on Friday at Cabrini Hospice in Manhattan. She was 80.         The cause was cancer, said her partner, Dr. Wilhelmina Perry.         Dr. Pantoja, who received the Presidential Medal of Freedom from President Bill Clinton in 1996 for her efforts to provide educational and economic opportunities for Puerto Ricans, was born in poverty in San Juan, P.R., in 1922. Wealthy neighbors helped her attend the University of Puerto Rico, where she earned a teaching certificate in 1942. She taught in a rural school for two years, then, as a member of the first wave of impoverished emigrants from the island, she moved to New York City.         At first finding wartime factory work as a welder, she won a scholarship to Hunter College, graduating with a bachelor's in sociology in 1952. She earned a master's degree from Columbia University's New York School of Social Work in 1954.         Upon graduation, Dr. Pantoja focused her attention on the grinding poverty of Puerto Ricans in New York. At the time, half the Puerto Rican families lived below the poverty line; 70 percent of those who were employed worked in the lowest-paying jobs; 50 percent of those above the age of 25 had less than an eighth-grade education; and 40 percent lived in substandard housing.         To begin addressing these problems, Dr. Pantoja founded the Puerto Rican Forum in 1957 to serve as an incubator for organizations and programs promoting economic self-sufficiency. The nonprofit organization is now known as the National Puerto Rican Forum.         Dr. Pantoja directed most of her energies, however, to improving the performance in New York schools of Puerto Rican children, children of Spanish speakers who were taught only in English. By 1961, two out of three eighth graders had fallen more than three years behind in reading; by 1963, when there were 179,000 Puerto Rican public school students, only 331 received high school academic diplomas, and only 28 went on to college.         In response, in 1961, Dr. Pantoja established Aspira, a nonprofit organization encouraging educational attainment, self-esteem, cultural awareness and leadership development.         Operating through clubs in city schools, Aspira used rituals and symbols to appeal to students tempted by gang culture. It had a solemn induction ceremony, based on a Taino Indian ritual, in which ''aspirantes'' held candles and pledged to pursue educational excellence and to dedicate their success to their community. Its symbol was the pitirre, a small tropical bird known for its agility and speed. The group taught the ''Aspira process'' of awareness, analysis and action.         Aspira now has offices in six states and Puerto Rico, and provides approximately 50,000 Latino students with career and college counseling, financial aid and other assistance. The program's graduates include Fernando Ferrer, the former Bronx borough president and 2001 mayoral candidate, and Anthony D. Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union.         As politics changed in the United States, especially with President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty, Dr. Pantoja shifted her emphasis from self-help programs to reform of the educational system.         In 1964, she helped draw up a request by the Puerto Rican Forum for $12.5 million from the city's antipoverty council to establish bilingual prekindergarten classes, after-school programs for struggling students, parental guidance and adult education courses, and other programs.         In 1967, she served on a committee, convened by Mayor John V. Lindsay, that recommended the decentralization of the school system. That summer, after the riots that occurred in many American cities, she attended the New York constitutional convention in Albany, where she pressed for the state to assume constitutional responsibility for free higher education, adult education and ''compensatory education'' for the disadvantaged.         In 1972, frustrated by what Dr. Pantoja saw as the continuing failure of city schools to educate Puerto Rican students -- who still had a graduation rate of only 30 percent -- Aspira filed a civil rights suit in federal court demanding that New York City provide classroom instruction in Spanish for struggling students. The suit resulted in a 1974 ruling ordering the city to establish bilingual classes and English as a second language classes for Latino students whose English skills were in the lowest fifth.         Dr. Pantoja was also active in higher education. In 1970, she established the Universidad Boricua and the Puerto Rican Research and Resource Center in Washington, becoming its chancellor in 1973, the same year that she earned a Ph.D. from Union Graduate School in Ohio. She joined the faculty of San Diego State University's School of Social Work in 1978, and later founded the Graduate School for Community Development.         After 1984, Dr. Pantoja devoted much of her time to work in Puerto Rico, establishing Producir, an organization that provides economic assistance to small businesses in poor rural areas, and Provivienda, which works to develop housing.         She is survived by her partner, Dr. Perry; her brother, Esteban Lopez; and her sister, Haydee Lopez.         Her autobiography, ''Memoir of a Visionary,'' is being published this month by Arte P√∫blico Press. She was also working on a history of Aspira.       
         Barbara Anne Castle, a onetime Labor cabinet minister and determined socialist whose radical, ill-timed attempt to tame Britain's mighty trade unions doomed her political career, died yesterday. She was 91.         She died peacefully in her sleep at her home in Buckinghamshire, her family said in a statement. In a tribute, Prime Minister Tony Blair described her as a ''radical independent spirit.''         Baroness Castle of Blackburn, as she became in 1990, served in Harold Wilson's first two Labor cabinets, from 1964 to 1970, and in his third, from 1974 to 1976. After Mr. Wilson's surprise resignation in 1976, she might well have become party leader and the first woman to serve as prime minister. But the unions, aroused by her efforts to curb their power, cut short her rise.         In 1969, as secretary of state for employment and productivity and with the prime minister's enthusiastic support, Ms. Castle had published a plan called ''In Place of Strife,'' which sought to inject some discipline into Britain's chaotic industrial relations by making trade unions subject to legal sanctions.         The proposal proved popular with the public at large but split the Labor cabinet and provoked so furious a backlash from the unions, on whom the party relied for votes and money, that it had to be withdrawn.         The home secretary, James Callaghan, had led the opposition to her plan within the cabinet, and when he succeeded Mr. Wilson as prime minister in 1976 his first act was to dismiss her. He told her she was too old for ministerial office.         Three years later, despite a lifetime's opposition to British membership of the European Common Market, as it was then called, Ms. Castle left the House of Commons and embarked on a second political career as a member of the European Parliament, where she spent the next 10 years fighting European federalism but supporting efforts to establish Europe-wide social standards.         Considered one of the most left-wing members of Mr. Wilson's three cabinets, Ms. Castle was an intensely ideological politician, a stranger to compromise and pragmatism whose misfortune was to serve at a time when Britain's perilous economic condition required both skills.         As Britain's first minister of overseas development, she pulled together a disparate array of aid programs run by different departments and subjected them all to a single test: the promotion of development in backward countries.         In 1965 she took over the transport ministry, where she confronted the railway unions with a recommendation to close 2,000 stations and 3,000 miles of track -- a task proposed by the preceding Conservative government.         She also introduced breathalyzer testing in a crackdown on drunken driving that cut road deaths by 1,200 in the first year and ordered safety belts fitted to new cars.         As secretary for employment and productivity, she legislated equal pay for men and women. And after a spell in opposition, she overhauled Britain's social security system as secretary for social services, linking state pensions to average earnings and introducing new child allowances paid directly to the mother rather than through a husband's pay check.         But she always served in governments buffeted by industrial unrest and unending currency crises, which forced them into deflationary policies she could never accept. She also served under party leaders anxious to maintain good relations with Washington during the Vietnam War, which she strongly opposed. She differed with the leaders also over their resolve to retain Britain's nuclear deterrent, which she wanted to abandon, and their determination to keep Britain in the European Common Market, which she had never wished to join.         Barbara Anne Betts was born on Oct. 10, 1910, in Chesterfield, Derbyshire, the daughter of a socialist tax inspector who taught himself ancient Greek and a strongly socialist mother, both of Quaker background.         From Bradford Girls Grammar School she won a scholarship to St. Hugh's College, Oxford, where, excluded from the student debating society, known as the Union, because it did not admit women, she threw herself into Labor Party politics to the neglect of everything else, graduating with a disappointing third-class degree.         After Oxford she entered local politics in London and helped found a left-wing weekly, Tribune, which was edited by her lover, William Mellor, who died before they could marry. Soon afterward she met Ted Castle, a political journalist, and married him in 1944. He died in 1979. They had no children.         She was sent to Parliament for Blackburn in Lancashire in 1945 as part of the postwar Labor landslide. The election brought Clement Attlee to power and led to the creation of the National Health Service and the nationalization of large swaths of British industry.         Ms. Castle's personal popularity with the party's rank and file was confirmed in 1950 when she was elected to its national executive committee, a post she held until 1979. But in her autobiography she acknowledged that the split between the party's extreme left wing (led by the Welsh firebrand Aneurin Bevan) and Labor's leadership ''helped keep the party out of office for 13 years.''         In 1952, Mr. Bevan published a personal political testament called ''In Place of Fear'' that greatly influenced Ms. Castle's thinking and largely explains how a self-proclaimed leftist like herself could set out to discipline Britain's powerful unions.         She borrowed shamelessly from its title when she called her reform blueprint ''In Place of Strife,'' thus seeking to place it in the middle of radical Labor Party thinking. What inspired those reforms, she wrote in her autobiography, was Bevan's plea for politicians to be more flexible and his belief that their ''Holy Grail'' should be ''the living truth, knowing that the truth being alive must change.''         This lead Ms. Castle to conclude, as she put it, that ''the trade unions, being an expression of the living truth, must learn to change their role'' and become more responsive to the needs of society as a whole.         Although ''In Place of Strife'' was stillborn, the task she had set herself would be accomplished a decade later by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, a Conservative, in every way her antithesis and a woman she disliked.       
         Flora Lewis, a correspondent and columnist who explained international politics to readers of The New York Times and other publications for nearly 60 years, died early Sunday morning at her home in Paris. She was 79.         The cause was cancer, said her son, Lindsey Gruson.         Heads of government and ordinary readers in the United States and Europe, where she lived for much of her career, looked to Flora Lewis's columns not only for her access to people in high places, but also for the dogged reporting and the sophisticated analysis that resulted.         Much of her work, done when foreign policy was made by men who thought women had no place in the world of diplomacy, revealed deep knowledge of history inflected by the experience of living through some of the most turbulent events of an epochal century.         She was in Eastern Europe in 1946 after the Communists took over, and she was there again for the Polish and Hungarian uprisings against Communism in 1956.         ''They had been called the 'captive nations' by the West,'' she wrote in one of her four books, ''Europe: Road to Unity,'' published in 1992 by Simon & Schuster. ''It was time to pull down the jail.''         Polish Communists reacted to the uprising in their country by reinstating Wladyslaw Gomulka as party chief, defying threats of military intervention from Moscow. Gomulka had been jailed while Stalin was the Soviet leader. ''It was the first time there had ever been a direct threat of confrontation between two Communist armies,'' Miss Lewis wrote of the events in Warsaw. ''And it turned out to be the first time that Moscow backed down.''         Then, turning to another armed confrontation that devolved into tragedy in Hungary, she wrote: ''Urgent appeals were broadcast to the Western countries for help. None came, only encouraging commentaries telling the overwhelmed Hungarians to keep up their struggle.''         Soviet troops crushed Hungary's fight for freedom in 1956, but more than three decades later, in 1989, Miss Lewis witnessed the collapse of Communism there and all over the European Continent.         ''The new era starts now,'' she wrote in the Foreign Affairs column of The New York Times in 1990, after German unification emerged from the wreckage of the Communist empire. ''The decisions being taken will hold for a long time, perhaps as long as the cold war lasted. This sense of novelty, of the fateful moment with all kinds of uncertain implications, accounts more for the unease, I think, than the behavior of Germany from Bismarck to 1945.''         In 1980 Miss Lewis became the third in a line of foreign affairs columnists of The New York Times, following Anne O'Hare McCormick and C. L. Sulzberger, and held that position until the end of 1990. She remained a senior columnist of The Times until 1994, and after the newspaper ended that arrangement, she continued writing columns regularly for The New York Times Syndicate and The International Herald Tribune in Paris, right up to this spring.         On the reporting trail or behind a typewriter -- she never learned to use a word processor, or wouldn't -- Miss Lewis was a formidable presence. Fiercely competitive, she would try to outthink and outwrite the competition on the job, and she could outdrink and outsmoke it off the job. No matter what the hour, her news antennae were always on.         Miss Lewis began her newspaper career in 1942 with The Associated Press in New York and Washington. Over the decades, she worked in Europe and Latin America for European and American newspapers, including The Washington Post. Her first column was published and syndicated by Newsday in 1966. She joined The Times in 1972 as bureau chief in Paris and later became the paper's European diplomatic correspondent as well.         ''This has always been a problem of mine, this tendency to spread myself too thin,'' Miss Lewis self-deprecatingly told Esquire magazine in 1980, after she had left reporting to be a columnist again. ''I dabble. I'll write about a gastronomic binge, I'll write about NATO, I'll do an interview with Nureyev, I'll do a political piece. I don't know a hell of a lot about anything.''         Her journalism won her many awards, including one for distinguished diplomatic reporting from Georgetown University's School of Foreign Affairs. She was also given honorary doctorates by the University of California at Los Angeles, Columbia, Princeton, Mount Holyoke, Bucknell, Muhlenberg and Manhattan Marymount.         Flora Lewis was born in Los Angeles on July 29, 1922, the daughter of Benjamin Lewis, a lawyer, and the former Pauline Kallin, a pianist. A precocious child, Flora graduated from high school at 15 and entered the University of California at Los Angeles. She earned a bachelor of arts degree three years later, in 1941, graduating summa cum laude and as a member of Phi Beta Kappa.         After receiving a graduate degree at the Columbia University School of Journalism the following year, she became a reporter for The Associated Press. She worked in New York City for an Associated Press service aimed at British subscribers, later covering the Navy and State Departments in Washington until 1945, when the agency sent her to London.         There, in 1945, she married Sydney Gruson, a correspondent in The Times's London bureau. Over the next two decades, the couple worked -- for separate newspapers -- in London, Jerusalem, Prague, Warsaw, Geneva, Bonn, Paris and Mexico City. Her articles also appeared in many European publications, among them The Observer, The Economist and The Financial Times in London and France-Soir in Paris.         ''I worked for everybody,'' she said, including The New York Times Magazine, but not for the newspaper itself. The Times's rules then barred her from being hired as long as her husband also worked there.         So in 1956, when Mr. Gruson was The Times's correspondent in Warsaw, Miss Lewis was hired by The Washington Post. Her extensive reporting of the Polish Communists' attempt to liberalize their government that year won her an Overseas Press Club award for best interpretation of foreign affairs.         Later she reported from Bonn, Eastern Europe and London for The Post and in 1965 was chosen to open the paper's bureau in New York City. A year after that, Mr. Gruson was transferred to Paris to run the International Edition that The Times was publishing there. Miss Lewis went with him and began writing her syndicated column for Newsday, calling it ''Today Abroad.''         Newspapers were mostly a man's world, as shown by the way The New York Post announced that it was acquiring her column in 1967. ''She can arrive home after a hectic day of reporting at the United Nations, and within minutes she's an excellent hostess and a marvelous companion to her husband,'' The Post reassured its readers. By that time, Miss Lewis and Mr. Gruson were the parents of three children. When asked how she managed both family and career, Miss Lewis would sometimes joke, ''By neglecting both.''         For her column, Miss Lewis roamed the globe, reporting on the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and making five trips to Vietnam during the fighting there. ''By the time I got to Vietnam,'' she said, ''I found the battlefield stories no longer very interesting. I was tired of reading about bullets that whoosh and marines screaming in anguish, and I didn't want to write it yet again.''         It was not until 1972, after she and Mr. Gruson separated, that she joined The Times. (They were later divorced.) The Times's executive editor, A. M. Rosenthal, who had said, ''Flora is the world's greatest correspondent,'' named her to head the Paris bureau.         Mr. Gruson, who later became a senior executive of The Times and a member of its board of directors, died in 1998. Their daughter Sheila Gruson died in 1999. Miss Lewis is survived by her son, Lindsey Gruson, a former reporter for The Times who operates a marketing company, Stet Inc., in South Kent, Conn., and a daughter, Kerry Gruson, a member of The Times's bureau in Miami.         In a spacious apartment near the French Parliament, Miss Lewis, a stylish but conservative dresser with memorably blue eyes, entertained the political and journalistic elite of Paris for more than a quarter of a century.         Her first major assignment for The Times was the secret peace talks in Paris between Henry A. Kissinger and the North Vietnamese negotiator Le Duc Tho, which produced a short-lived cease-fire in Vietnam in 1973.         Mr. Rosenthal asked her in 1976 if she would become chief of the Washington Bureau in the event that another correspondent he had already asked, Hedrick Smith, turned down the job. If he had, Miss Lewis would have been the first woman in the post, but Mr. Smith accepted.         Miss Lewis was amused but also insulted by the overture. ''It was as though he had said, 'If my fianc√©e jilts me at the altar, will you stand in?' '' she later told Nan Robertson, a former Times reporter, who described the incident in a 1992 book, ''The Girls in the Balcony: Women, Men, and The New York Times'' (Random House).         Mr. Rosenthal, Miss Lewis learned later, was infuriated to find her quoted in the book. But the point she wanted to make was that, as she put it, ''No man would ever have offered another man a job in that way.''         Instead, Mr. Rosenthal made Miss Lewis European diplomatic correspondent, assigning her to pull together ''a whole range of subjects -- party and ideological trends, the Common Market, diplomatic initiatives.'' In that role she covered the emerging European Economic Community, now the European Union. ''The salient fact about Europe remains the nation-state,'' she wrote in her book ''Europe'' in 1992. ''There is a sense of shared Europeanness which has waxed and waned in the last two generations, but it is still secondary to the sense of unique nationality which began to arise after the Renaissance and the decline of feudalism.''         As she put it, ''It is the same old Europe, and it changes every day.''         Not long ago, recalling the years when she traveled the world as a correspondent and a columnist, she said: ''There are stories you work on where you know this is really big, important history, and they are almost always bad news, disasters or tragedies. But covering President Anwar Sadat's trip to Jerusalem in 1977 was different -- there was an atmosphere of such joy and delight, both in Israel and in Egypt, that it was an inspiring experience.''         ''I've gone as far as Tokyo, Havana, Cape Town,'' she told Esquire in 1980. ''I've spent almost my entire adult life abroad, and I find that in some ways I've become something of a foreigner myself. I keep telling myself that at some point I'd like to get over that.''         Yet her columns had a distinctively American voice.         ''The old idea was that history was about kings and popes and wars; people, yes, but only the few who held dazzling power,'' she wrote in her last regular column for The Times at the end of 1990. ''More and more people are coming to realize that they can choose their history. What a wonderful time to have been able to watch up close!''       
         June Jordan, who came of age as a poet when the voices of black female writers were just beginning to be heard, died on June 14 at her home in Berkeley, Calif.         She was 65. The cause was breast cancer, which she fought for a decade, said Adrienne Torff, a friend.         Like the careers of Audre Lord and Alice Walker, Ms. Jordan's was forged by the black arts movement of the 60's and 70's. Her poetry was imbued with advocacy for the poor, for women and the disenfranchised.         In an interview yesterday, Ms. Walker, a close friend, called the small, elegant but tough Ms. Jordan, ''unwillingly nonviolent.'' In ''Poem About Police Violence,'' she wrote about the so-called accidental death of a black man in police custody: ''Tell me something/ what you think would happen if/ everytime they kill a black boy/ then we kill a cop/ everytime they kill a black man/ then we kill a cop/ you think the accident rate would lower/ subsequently?''         Still, Ms. Jordan could be a poet of great delicacy, as in ''On a New Year's Eve,'' in which she describes watching a lover sleep: ''and/ as I watch your arm/ your/ brown arm/ just/ before it moves/ I know/ all things are dear/ that disappear/ all things are dear/ that disappear.''         She was the author or editor of 28 books, essays and novels for children and the libretto for the 1995 opera by John Adams ''I Was Looking at the Ceiling and Then I Saw the Sky.''         She was also a teacher. At the University of California, Berkeley, where she was a professor of African-American Studies, she founded Poetry for the People, which trains undergraduates to take poetry to community groups as a form of political empowerment.         Ms. Jordan was born in Harlem, the daughter of Jamaican immigrants, Granville Ivanhoe Jordan, a postal clerk, and Mildred, a nurse. Ms. Jordan's mother was deeply depressed and eventually committed suicide.         Her father had wanted a boy and referred to her as ''he.'' In ''Soldier: A Poet's Childhood'' (Basic Civitas Books, 1999) she described being brutally beaten by him: ''Like a growling beast, the roll-away mahogany doors rumble open, and the light snaps on and a fist smashes into the side of my head and I am screaming awake: 'Daddy! What did I do?!' '' Yet her father helped forge her identity as a writer, she said, giving her books by Paul Lawrence Dunbar and forcing her to memorize Shakespeare.         In a radio interview two years ago, Ms. Jordan appeared to have come to terms with her father. She said: ''He didn't know what to do to try to provide against the failure of his only child in this new land. I think that probably contributed to the violence of his frustration. But that he loved me and thought me capable of anything and everything there was never any doubt.''         After the family moved to Brooklyn, Ms. Jordan became the only black student at Midwood High School. Later, she won a scholarship to the Northfield School for Girls in Massachusetts, now the coeducational Northfield-Mount Hermon School.         After Northfield she attended Barnard College in New York City where she met Michael Meyer, a white student. The couple married and had a son, Christopher, who lives in Montana.         In her book of essays, ''Civil Wars'' (Scribner's, 1996), Ms. Jordan wrote of the difficulties of an interracial marriage. In 1966 the couple divorced. She raised her son largely on her own, struggling to eke out a living as a freelance journalist. She was a researcher and writer for Mobilization for Youth in New York, and in 1967 she got a teaching job at City College. Two years later she published a children's book, ''Who Look at Me?''         To the end, she remained involved in politics. In September Basic Civitas books is scheduled to publish ''Some of Us Did Not Die,'' which contains essays on Israel, Islam and O. J. Simpson. The book's title is from a poem she read last year in a speech at Barnard. She spoke of her battle with breast cancer and about the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, which she said proved the need for a secular democracy that protects the rights of ''male/ female/Jew/ Gentile/ Muslim.''         She read from a poem in which she imagined her dying body and a predatory hawk gliding overhead: ''He makes that dive/ to savage/ me/ and inches/ from the blood flood lusty/ beak/ I roll away/ I speak/ I laugh out loud/ Not yet/ big bird of prey/ not yet.''         Correction:  June 20, 2002, Thursday  An obituary on Tuesday about the poet June Jordan misspelled the middle name of an author whose books she credited with having helped forge her identity as a writer. He was Paul Laurence Dunbar, not Lawrence.         Correction:  June 27, 2002, Thursday  An obituary of the poet June Jordan on June 18 misspelled the surname of a poet whose career, like Ms. Jordan's, was forged by the black arts movement of the 60's and 70's. She was Audre Lorde, not Lord.       
         Maia Wojciechowska, an award-winning author of children's books, died on June 13 in Long Branch, N.J. She was 74.         The cause was a stroke, said her daughter Oriana Rodman.         Ms. Wojciechowska wrote 19 books, the best-known of which is ''Shadow of a Bull'' (1964), about a young boy in Spain who finds his identity after his father, a bullfighter, dies in the ring. The book won the Newbery Medal in 1965.         The book's authenticity came from the author's own experience. Ernest Hemingway acclaimed her as an expert on bullfighting; she managed to get training with fighting bulls and killed one in the ring in Mexico.         Maia Teresa Wojciechowska was born to Zygmunt Wojciechowski and Zofia Wojciechowska in Warsaw on Aug. 7, 1927. When the Nazis invaded Poland at the outbreak of World War II, the family escaped to southern France and later joined her father, a colonel and chief of staff of the Polish Air Force, in England.         After the war, the family moved to Los Angeles. She entered college in 1945 but dropped out after a year. In 1950 she married the author Selden Rodman, who helped her publish her first book, ''Market Day for Ti Andr√©,'' (1952). Their marriage ended in divorce in 1957. Her second marriage, to Richard Larkin, in 1972, ended in divorce the next year.         In addition to writing, Ms. Wojciechowska was a private detective, a translator for Radio Free Europe, a publicity director for Hawthorn Books and a professional tennis player and instructor. In 1975 she started her own publishing company.         She is survived by two daughters, Ms. Rodman, of Santa Fe, N.M., and Leonora Wojciechowska of Garfield, N.J.; and two brothers, Zbigniew, of Laguna Hills, Calif., and Christopher Wojciechowski, of Pebble Beach, Calif.       
         Sophie G. Untermeyer, a longtime supporter and key staff member of the New York Philharmonic and a noted sportswoman, died on Saturday at the Jewish Home and Hospital in Manhattan. She was 92 and had lived on the Upper East Side.         She was on the Philharmonic's board of directors from 1970 to 1997. She was fund-raising director from 1965 to 1980 and director of Friends of the Philharmonic, a fund-raising group, from 1958 to 1980. She did volunteer work as well as paid work for the Philharmonic.         Mrs. Untermeyer was associate chairman of the Lewisohn Stadium Concerts in the 1950's and 60's. Her association with the concerts began when she was in her 30's and started assisting her mother, Minnie Guggenheimer, who had founded and run the concerts. After her mother's death in 1966, Mrs. Untermeyer took over.         Mrs. Untermeyer played tennis and polo, and after hurting a knee playing polo, took up golf. She won the New York Women's Metropolitan Golf Championship eight times.         She was born in Manhattan and graduated from the Lincoln School.         Her 1935 marriage to Dewitt E. Untermeyer ended in divorce in 1943.         She is survived by two nephews, Charles S. Guggenheimer and Randolph Guggenheimer Jr., both of Manhattan.       
         Flora Lewis, a correspondent and columnist who explained international politics to readers of The New York Times and other publications for nearly 60 years, died early yesterday morning at her home in Paris. She was 79.         The cause was cancer, said her son, Lindsey Gruson.         Heads of government and ordinary readers in the United States and Europe, where she lived for much of her career, looked to Flora Lewis's columns not only for her access to people in high places, but also for her dogged reporting and the sophisticated analysis that resulted.         Much of her work, done when foreign policy was made by men who thought women had no place in the world of diplomacy, revealed deep knowledge of history inflected by the experience of living through some of the most turbulent events of an epochal century.

''They had been called the 'captive nations' by the West,'' she wrote in one of her four books, ''Europe: Road to Unity,'' published in 1992 by Simon & Schuster. ''It was time to pull down the jail.''         Polish Communists reacted to the uprising in their country by reinstating Wladyslaw Gomulka as party chief, defying threats of military intervention from Moscow. Gomulka had been jailed while Stalin was the Soviet leader. ''It was the first time there had ever been a direct threat of confrontation between two Communist armies,'' Miss Lewis wrote. ''And it turned out to be the first time that Moscow backed down.''         Then, turning to another armed confrontation that devolved into tragedy, in Hungary, she wrote: ''Urgent appeals were broadcast to the Western countries for help. None came, only encouraging commentaries telling the overwhelmed Hungarians to keep up their struggle.''         Soviet troops crushed Hungary's fight for freedom in 1956, but more than three decades later, in 1989, Miss Lewis witnessed the collapse of Communism all over Europe.         ''The new era starts now,'' she wrote in the Foreign Affairs column of The New York Times in 1990, after German unification emerged from the wreckage of the Communist empire. ''The decisions being taken will hold for a long time, perhaps as long as the cold war lasted.

There, in 1945, she married Sydney Gruson, a correspondent in The Times's London bureau.

Her articles also appeared in many European publications, among them The Observer, The Economist and The Financial Times in London and France-Soir in Paris.         ''I worked for everybody,'' she said, including The New York Times Magazine, but not for the newspaper itself. The Times's rules then barred her from being hired as long as her husband also worked there.         So in 1956, when Mr. Gruson was The Times's correspondent in Warsaw, Miss Lewis was hired by The Washington Post. Her extensive reporting of the Polish Communists' attempt to liberalize their government that year won her an Overseas Press Club award for best interpretation of foreign affairs.         Later she reported from Bonn, Eastern Europe and London for The Post and in 1965 was chosen to open the paper's bureau in New York City. A year after that, Mr. Gruson was transferred to Paris to run the International Edition that The Times was publishing there.

It was not until 1972, after she and Mr. Gruson separated, that she joined The Times. (They were later divorced.) The Times's executive editor, A. M. Rosenthal, who had said, ''Flora is the world's greatest correspondent,'' named her to head the Paris bureau.         Mr. Gruson, who later became a senior executive of The Times and a member of its board, died in 1998. Their daughter Sheila Gruson died in 1999. Miss Lewis is survived by her son, Lindsey Gruson, a former reporter for The Times who operates a marketing company, Stet Inc., in South Kent, Conn., and a daughter, Kerry Gruson, a member of The Times's bureau in Miami.         In a spacious apartment near the French Parliament, Miss Lewis, a stylish but conservative dresser with memorably blue eyes, entertained the political and journalistic elite of Paris for more than a quarter of a century.         Her first major assignment for The Times was the secret peace talks in Paris between Henry A.

I keep telling myself that at some point I'd like to get over that.''         Yet her columns had a distinctively American voice.         ''The old idea was that history was about kings and popes and wars; people, yes, but only the few who held dazzling power,'' she wrote in her last regular column for The Times at the end of 1990. ''More and more people are coming to realize that they can choose their history. What a wonderful time to have been able to watch up close!''       
         Dolores Gray, a singer and actress whose success on Broadway and London's West End led to starring roles in several 1950's Hollywood musical extravaganzas, died on Wednesday in her Manhattan apartment. She was 78.         The cause was a heart attack, her lawyer, Martin D. Newman, said.         Tall and sultry, with generous lips, Ms. Gray had a rich contralto voice that one London critic described as ''warm brandy.'' She started her career on radio, singing with Rudy Vallee, and moved on to several stage and movie roles. Her first major success was playing the lead in ''Annie Get Your Gun'' in London in 1947.         The show, with Ms. Gray as Annie, ran for 2 years and 11 months. ''She is exceedingly pretty,'' wrote the critic for The Daily Telegraph, ''has a devastating sense of comedy, and her points are made with the clean smack of one of Annie's bullets hitting the center of the target.''         Her London success led to major Broadway roles. She starred in the musical ''Carnival in Flanders,'' for which she won a Tony in 1954 for best musical actress. The show lasted only six performances; Ms. Gray's Tony came for what still ranks as one of the shortest-lived winning performances. Although the show was far from a hit, the song she introduced in it, ''Here's That Rainy Day,'' by Jimmy Van Heusen, with lyrics by Johnny Burke, later became a standard.         In 1955 she signed a contract with MGM, and in the next three years she made four films. Her first was ''Kismet,'' in which she starred alongside Sebastian Cabot, Vic Damone and Ann Blyth. That same year she appeared in ''It's Always Fair Weather,'' with Gene Kelly, Cyd Charisse and Dan Dailey. Her next MGM film was ''The Opposite Sex,'' with June Allyson, Joan Collins and Ann Sheridan. Her last was ''Designing Woman,'' which also starred Gregory Peck, Lauren Bacall and Sam Levene.         Dolores Gray was born in Chicago on June 7, 1924. Her parents divorced when she was 2, and her father died five years later. Her mother took her to Hollywood, where, at 14, Dolores began performing in clubs. At 15, she was discovered by Vallee, who gave her a guest spot on his radio show, which was broadcast nationwide.         While her singing was often compared to that of full-voiced Broadway legends like Ethel Merman, Ms. Gray didn't think of herself that way. ''Actually, my voice is fragile, but I know how to amplify it,'' she told an interviewer.         She made her Broadway debut in 1944 with Beatrice Lillie in ''Seven Lively Arts.'' That same year she made her screen debut in a small part in ''Mr. Skeffington,'' starring Bette Davis. In 1945, she was one of four leading ladies in ''Are You With It?'' In 1951, she starred with Bert Lahr in ''Two on the Aisle.''         After Hollywood, Ms. Gray returned to Broadway for several productions.         Ms. Gray recorded for Capitol Records, sang in clubs and played many roles on television. She also appeared on television variety shows with hosts like Ed Sullivan, Steve Allen and Perry Como and on the Bell Telephone Hour.         She returned to London in 1973 and again in 1987 to star in revivals of ''Gypsy'' and ''Follies.''         Ms. Gray's marriage to Andrew Crevolin, a California real estate developer and horse race owner whose horse ''Determine'' won the Kentucky Derby in 1954, ended in divorce.         She is survived by a stepdaughter, Joanne Kildare, of Alamo, Calif.         After her return to Broadway, she made some of the biggest headlines of her career. On May 28, 1959, during a matinee of ''Destry Rides Again,'' opposite Andy Griffith at the Imperial Theater, the stage curtain caught fire as Ms. Gray sang a love song, ''Anyone Would Love You.'' As the theater's fireman and stagehands noisily started fighting the fire from backstage, Ms. Gray kept singing.         ''When I spotted the flames, I nudged Andy,'' she said later. ''Neither of us moved. I just kept on singing louder and louder to try to drown out the noise backstage.''         Ms. Gray was credited with keeping the full house of 1,504 people calm as the fire was extinguished. The audience applauded wildly and then quietly filed out as the show took an unusual 40-minute intermission. After the damage was assessed and the water cleaned up, Ms. Gray and Mr. Griffith went on with the show.         Correction:  July 17, 2002, Wednesday  An obituary of the actress Dolores Gray on June 29 included an erroneous reference, from her lawyer, to her marriage to Andrew Crevolin, a California real estate developer who died in 1992. At his death they were married, not divorced.       
         Rosemary Clooney, whose warm, radiant voice placed her in the first rank of American popular singers for more than half a century, died last night at her home in Beverly Hills. She was 74.         The cause was complications from lung cancer, according to her spokeswoman, Linda Dozoretz.         Ms. Clooney did not dig as deeply into the emotional content of a song as Frank Sinatra did; she never tried to emulate the sound and delivery of an instrument as Mel Torm√© seemed to do so easily; she did not burst into the scat choruses favored by Ella Fitzgerald. But she sang with so much assuredness, simplicity and honesty that these elements became her trademark and endeared her to audiences and critics alike.         In recent years Ms. Clooney had been appearing in the best cabarets and concert stages singing pop-jazz standards that earned her new audiences and renewed respect. Reviewing a performance at Michael's Pub in Manhattan, Stephen Holden of The New York Times said of her: ''Her special strength is an ability to infuse everything she touches with warmth, intelligence and a subtly swinging energy that make her interpretations of standards models of balance and clarity. Her emotional perspective is dry-eyed and perceptive. ''         Although she did her best work singing standards with a fidelity to their composers, Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen, Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, George and Ira Gershwin, Johnny Burke, Jimmy Van Heusen and Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, her beginnings were decidedly in a genre not nearly so distinguished. She became one of America's best-known popular singers in 1951 with a novelty called ''Come-on-a-My House,'' and followed that with other novelties like ''Botcha-Me,'' ''Mambo Italiano,'' and ''This Old House.'' songs that her audiences always wanted to hear.         Some fans even occasionally asked her to sing ''How Much Is That Doggie in the Window,'' a novelty that belonged to Patti Page. ''They probably figure if it's a bad song I must have done it,'' she once said.         But even then Ms. Clooney recorded ballads like ''Tenderly'' and ''Hey There'' with such simplicity and beauty that they also became songs indelibly associated with her. Ms. Clooney with a good ballad was always approachable and intimate.         Her early career reached a height in 1954 when she appeared opposite Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye singing Irving Berlin songs in the hit musical ''White Christmas.'' But her good looks and cheery disposition masked a life with more than its share of pain.         She survived a disastrous marriage to the actor Jose Ferrer; she was scarred by the assassination of her friend Robert Kennedy, which she witnessed first hand; she abused drugs and had affairs that disappointed and wounded her; she had a childhood of uncertainty with an affably alcoholic father and a mother who eventually deserted the family.         And yet Ms. Clooney never completely lost her admiration for Mr. Ferrer, the father of her five children, whom she married and divorced twice, not even after she learned of his womanizing during their marriage that led her to conclude that he was breaking her heart ''in small increments.'' And she always made a place in her home for the parents who had not done the same for her when she was a child.         Rosemary Clooney was born May 23, 1928, in Maysville, Ky., a small town on the Ohio River southeast of Cincinnati. She was one of five children born to Andrew and Frances Guilfoyle Clooney. Mr. Clooney was a house painter who drank so much and so often that his own father, a jeweler who served several terms as mayor of Maysville, had his son jailed for public drunkenness.         Rosemary and her sister Betty began to sing publicly, at first for political rallies for her grandfather, who was mayor of Maysville, later at amateur contests throughout northern Kentucky and southern Ohio.         When Rosemary was in high school and Betty was in junior high, radio station WLW in Cincinnati conducted a talent contest. The sisters won and for a time were heard seven nights a week, earning $20 each.         The sisters began to sing with Barney Rapp's big band, which performed around Cincinnati. An agent for Tony Pastor heard them and for the next three years the Clooney Sisters became vocalists for the Pastor big band.         In 1946, Rosemary Clooney made her first solo recording, ''I'm Sorry I Didn't Say I'm Sorry When I Made You Cry Last Night,'' which attracted attention because she sang it in a whisper that disk jockeys all around the country speculated was was going to be the new style. In reality, she had been so petrified when she stood before the microphone that she could not sing the song in full voice as she had intended.         By 1947, she was gaining notice. In 1948, Betty Clooney quit the Pastor band, but Rosemary stayed with him another year before she left as well, hopeful of success because she had signed a contract with Columbia Records. The initial deal was that she would be paid $50 a recording.         In 1950 she attracted favorable attention with an appearance on the ''Songs For Sale'' television show and with her recording of ''Beautiful Brown Eyes,'' her first real hit for Columbia. She started to appear regularly on television.         But her first megahit came the next year, when Mitch Miller, the artist and repertory man at Columbia, persuaded her to sing ''Come On-a My House.'' From the instant that Ms. Clooney heard it she thought it was dreadful and told Mr. Miller she would not sing it but He insisted. The recording became a runaway best seller and Ms. Clooney became a star.         The success emboldened Mr. Miller to assign her to other novelty songs, most notably ''Botcha Me'' and ''Mambo Italiano'' that also became hits. When she made her screen debut in ''The Stars Are Singing,'' she was trumpeted as ''the next Betty Hutton'' and she made the cover of Time magazine in 1953 with her bouncier image.         ''I always wanted to sing sad ballads, but I didn't get many opportunities,'' Ms. Clooney once told Stephen Holden of The Times. ''If I found something I wanted to do, I had to get permission. At the same time, you can't quarrel with success. If it hadn't been for 'Come on-a My House,' I probably wouldn't be here now.''         Ms. Clooney remained busy and successful for the rest of the 1950's. She married Mr. Ferrer in 1953 and made more movies, including ''White Christmas'' in 1954 with Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and Vera-Ellen.         But in the early 1960's she and Mr. Ferrer became estranged, she had an affair with the arranger Nelson Riddle, and she slowly became addicted to sleeping pills. Her work habits became erratic and she got tagged as being undependable. She found it difficult to find work. Her singing deteriorated.         By the end of the decade, she was ''dead behind the eyes,'' she recalled in her 1977 memoir, ''This For Remembrance.'' Her divorce from Mr. Ferrer became final in 1967.         In 1968, she supported the presidential aspirations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and was standing near him when he was shot to death in Los Angeles. Ms. Clooney, recalling the day in her memoir, said she was convinced that he hadn't died, that it was somehow all a big hoax.         Her self-destructive rampage continued until she spent a month in the psychiatric ward of Mount Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. And when she emerged, She was short of money and supported herself by singing for anyone who would pay her. Mostly it was weekend work at Holiday Inns.         Her fortunes changed again in 1974 when Bing Crosby asked her to appear with him at a show marking his 50th anniversary in show business. She did well and then made several successful tours with him and also toured with Margaret Whiting, Helen O'Connell and Rose Marie in a show called ''4 Girls 4.''         She suffered a setback in 1976 when her sister Betty died of an aneurysm but regained control of herself and worked on her memoirs.         In the 1990's, she recorded many songs for the Concord Jazz label and the critics agreed that her voice had gotten better.         She is survived by her children: the actor Miguel Ferrer; Maria, a designer; Gabriel, a painter married to Debby Boone; Monsita Teresa; Rafael, a voice-over actor, and her husband, Dante DiPaolo, a dancer. Other survivors include a nephew, George Clooney, the actor.       
         Caroline Knapp, a writer and columnist whose memoir ''Drinking: A Love Story'' vividly chronicled her struggle to overcome alcoholism, died yesterday at a hospital in Cambridge, Mass. She was 42 and lived in Cambridge.         The cause was lung cancer, her family said.         In ''Drinking'' Ms. Knapp wrote about the disturbing incongruities of her life as what she called a ''high-functioning alcoholic'': she was an award-winning journalist, an Ivy League graduate from a well-to-do New England family and by all appearances a happy, healthy and successful young woman. But drinking had slowly taken hold of her life, and she was desperate to conceal its effects.         She was, she wrote, ''smooth and ordered on the outside; roiling and chaotic and desperately secretive underneath, but not noticeably so, never noticeably so.''         The book, published by Dial Press in 1996, was praised by critics for its painful honestly in describing the grip of addiction and the difficulty of overcoming it. In a review in The New York Times, Christopher Lehmann-Haupt called it ''a remarkable exercise in self-discovery.'' The book remained on The New York Times best-seller list for several weeks in both hardcover and paperback editions.         In ''Drinking'' Ms. Knapp characterized her addiction as a bad love affair. In her next book, she found a healthier relationship. ''I am in love with my dog,'' she wrote near the beginning of ''Pack of Two: The Intricate Bond Between People and Dogs'' (Dial Press, 1998).         ''I'm 38 and I'm single,'' she continued, ''and I'm having my most intense and gratifying relationship with a dog. But we all learn about love in different ways, and this way happens to be mine.''         ''Pack of Two'' was also a best-seller and, like ''Drinking,'' it commingled autobiography with nonfiction in its passages on dog rearing and pet-inspired self-analysis like ''I understand the impulse to romanticize the dog; I struggle with it myself.''         Ms. Knapp developed her style in her years as a columnist at The Boston Phoenix, an alternative weekly newspaper where she worked from 1988 to 1995 and to which she continued to contribute until 1999. Her ''Out There'' column, in which she often wrote about the travails in life and love of a semifictional 30-something single woman named Alice K. -- ''not her real initial'' -- was one of the paper's most popular features and won her an Alternative Newsweekly Award in 1996. She was often light and humorous in the paper, but could be poignantly confessional, as in a memorable column about her struggles with anorexia.         Her columns, were collected in 1994 in the book ''Alice K.'s Guide to Life: One Woman's Quest for Survival, Sanity and the Perfect New Shoes'' (Dutton/Plume).         Ms. Knapp graduated with honors from Brown University and worked as a reporter for The Boston Business Journal before joining at The Phoenix, where she was a features writer and later the lifestyle editor.         Her lung cancer was diagnosed in mid-April, and on May 11 she married Mark Morelli. She had recently completed work on a book about women's appetites.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a sister, Rebecca, of West Boylston, Mass.; and a brother, Andrew, of Salem, Mass.       
         Shirley Aronoff Greitzer, a pianist who was the director of placement at the Juilliard School for nearly a decade and executive director of the Waterloo Music Festival School before that, died on May 29. She was 76 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was kidney and heart failure, said Jody Schwarz, one of her three daughters.         Mrs. Greitzer was born in Dallas in 1926. She began her musical studies there and made her first professional appearances with the Dallas Symphony as the soloist in concertos by Mozart and Liszt.         When she was 17, she won first prize in a competition sponsored by Mu Phi Epsilon, a music honors organization, and was awarded a scholarship to the Juilliard School. She continued her piano studies there with Rosina Lhevine and became Lhevine's assistant. She also studied chamber music with Felix Salmond and Louis Persinger. In the early 1950's, she made her recital debut at Town Hall.         In the early 1970's, she was the harpsichordist for the Philharmonia Virtuosi of New York. When the Waterloo Festival and its music school opened in Waterloo Village, N.J., in 1976, she joined the faculty as a chamber music instructor. In 1979, she became executive director, a position she held until 1988.         In 1990, Mrs. Greitzer became the director of placement at the Juilliard School, a position that included arranging performances for students. She established noontime concert series around New York for the students, but although the performances were largely intended to give them experience before audiences, Mrs. Greitzer insisted that they be paid.         Mrs. Greitzer was married to Sol Greitzer, who for many years was the principal violist of the New York Philharmonic. He died in 1989.         She is survived by her daughters, Ms. Schwarz, of Seattle; Deborah Greitzer Silberschlag, of Waldorf, Md.; and Pamela Manasse, of Manhattan; a sister, Marjorie Weissman, of Queens; and six grandchildren.       
         Holly Solomon, an art dealer known for her championship of the new and untried, for her spirited, high-stepping lifestyle and for being the subject of a glamorous portrait by Andy Warhol that made her a Pop icon like Elizabeth Taylor and Marilyn Monroe, died on Thursday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. She was 68 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was complications from pneumonia, her son Thomas said.         In its heyday, the Holly Solomon Gallery represented an eclectic mix of talents, from the video artist Nam June Paik to William Wegman, the painter and draftsman better known as a whimsical photographer of Weimaraners. The gallery was especially known for nurturing, in the 1970's, the mini-movement known as Pattern and Decoration, a reaction to the austerities of Minimalism.         ''P & D'' artists -- among them Kim MacConnel, Brad Davis, Robert Kushner, Ned Smyth, Valerie Jaudon and Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt -- used humble materials like plastic wrap and motifs from exotic cultures to produce ornate, wildly patterned paintings and assemblages.         In 1969, before becoming dealers, Ms. Solomon and her husband, Horace, opened 98 Greene Street Loft, one of the first so-called alternative spaces in New York, where poetry readings, dance performances, concerts and art shows took place. It lasted three years and gave very early exposure to talents like Laurie Anderson, Robert Mapplethorpe, Mr. Kushner and Gordon Matta-Clark.         A small, vivacious woman with silver-blond hair, Ms. Solomon was a forceful personality who regarded her artists as part of her family. (When she moved to a smaller apartment in 1988, a group of them designed, decorated and made furniture for it.) A fashionista and a voracious shopper, she was always dressed in her version of the latest, including the quirky costume jewelry that she collected.         With Mr. Solomon, her partner in the gallery until their separation in 1988, she gave lavish soirees at their East 57th Street apartment for hundreds of people involved -- or not -- in her world. Artists were always part of the crowd. ''Unlike others who invited artists to be the entertainment,'' Mr. Kushner said yesterday, ''the Solomons regarded us as guests, and they fed us very well.''         An early collector of Pop art, Ms. Solomon liked to refer to herself as a ''Pop princess.'' Her portrait was done by Mapplethorpe, Roy Lichtenstein, Richard Artschwager, Christo, Robert Rauschenberg and, of course, Warhol.         She was fond of relating how, for the Warhol portrait (a nine-panel work sold at auction by Christie's last year for $2 million), she took $25 in quarters into a photo booth and spent hours snapping herself doing facial exercises learned as a budding actress. Two years later Warhol produced the portrait.         The glamorous Solomon persona was tempered by a sense of fun. Mr. Kushner, who as a young artist searched for manufacturers' cast-off fabrics in SoHo, recalls that he was working in a local restaurant when Ms. Solomon, already a collector of his art, appeared in a floor-length white mink coat. Outside was her father-in-law's station wagon and a chauffeur. ''Let's go for a ride,'' she commanded, and soon they were having an uproarious time digging in trash bins around SoHo.         Ms. Solomon was born Hollis Dworken in Bridgeport, Conn., where her Russian-born father ran a grocery and liquor store. She attended Vassar College but switched to Sarah Lawrence, where her interests in acting, art and social life were more readily fulfilled. She soon met and married Mr. Solomon, a Yale graduate working for his wealthy father, a hairnet and bobby-pin manufacturer.         At first the two lived a proper, well-heeled Manhattan life. But Ms. Solomon, enrolled in Lee Strasberg's Actor's Studio, began to make the rounds of Off Off Broadway theaters. With time on her hands, she took to dropping in at art galleries and museums. Her first acquisition, a ceramic lamp by Dan Flavin, was quickly followed by others, including a Brillo carton by Warhol that was put to use as a coffee table.         Soon the couple had an extensive collection of Pop art, and by 1967 they were well established on the scene. On the acting front, Ms. Solomon, under the name Hollis Belmont, appeared in a feature-length movie, ''The Plot Against Harry,'' made by an independent filmmaker in 1969 (but not released until 1989), in which she played a prostitute. In 1972 she wrote, directed and produced ''98.5,'' about five artists at the 98 Greene Street Loft; it won an award at the Edinburgh Film Festival that year. But her acting career was a failure, and she became more and more involved with art.         In 1975, three years after the 98 Greene Street Loft had closed, the Solomons opened their first commercial space, the Holly Solomon Gallery at 392 West Broadway in SoHo. It was devoted to Ms. Solomon's discoveries: young artists whose work looked beyond that of the Pop/Minimal establishment. By 1978, after several shaky years, the gallery was discovered by European dealers and collectors and became a hot SoHo destination.         But in 1983 the Solomons, alarmed at SoHo's expansion and faced with a steep rent increase, moved the gallery uptown to 724 Fifth Avenue, at 57th Street, where, though smaller, it retained its glittering presence. In the early 1990's the gallery moved back to SoHo, at 172 Mercer Street, where Ms. Solomon showed her regular artists like Mr. Paik and newer additions like Izhar Patkin. After real estate and legal difficulties, Ms. Solomon closed that gallery three years ago. Wanting to be in on the Chelsea action, in the last few years she operated out of an appointment-only gallery at the Chelsea Hotel.         Ms. Solomon's survivors include, besides her son Thomas, of Los Angeles, another son, John, also of Los Angeles, and a brother, Dr. Donald Dworken of Greenwich, Conn.         ''She was an original, as strong a personality as any of her artists,'' said Mr. Wegman, who was particularly close to the Solomon family. ''She loved art and people. Her death, like Warhol's, leaves a gap.''       
         Rosemary Clooney, whose warm, radiant voice placed her in the first rank of American popular singers for more than half a century, died Saturday night at her home in Beverly Hills. She was 74.         The cause was complications from lung cancer, according to her spokeswoman, Linda Dozoretz.         Ms. Clooney did not dig as deeply into the emotional content of a song as Frank Sinatra did; she never tried to emulate the sound and delivery of an instrument as Mel Torm√© seemed to do so easily; she did not burst into the scat choruses favored by Ella Fitzgerald. But she sang with so much assuredness, simplicity and honesty that these elements became her trademark and endeared her to audiences and critics alike. In the words of the director Mike Nichols, ''She sings like Spencer Tracy acts.''         In recent years Ms. Clooney had been appearing in the best cabarets and on concert stages, largely with small groups, singing pop-jazz standards that earned her new audiences and renewed respect. Reviewing a performance at Michael's Pub in Manhattan, Stephen Holden of The New York Times said of her: ''Her special strength is an ability to infuse everything she touches with warmth, intelligence and a subtly swinging energy that make her interpretations of standards models of balance and clarity. Her emotional perspective is dry-eyed and perceptive. Rather than acting out the romantic dramas of well-known song lyrics, she projects an understanding that is almost maternal in its blend of wisdom and empathy.''         Although she did her best work singing standards with a fidelity to their composers, Johnny Mercer and Harold Arlen, Cole Porter, Duke Ellington, George and Ira Gershwin, Johnny Burke, Jimmy Van Heusen and Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, her beginnings were decidedly in a genre not nearly so distinguished. She became one of America's best-known popular singers in 1951 with a novelty called ''Come-on-a-My House,'' which became a huge hit record, and followed that with other novelties like ''Botcha-Me,'' ''Mambo Italiano'' and ''This Old House,'' songs that her audiences always wanted to hear long after she was pursuing a less-flamboyant repertory.         Some fans even occasionally asked her to sing ''How Much Is That Doggie in the Window?'' a novelty that belonged to Patti Page, never to Rosemary Clooney. ''They probably figure if it's a bad song I must have done it,'' she once said about her earlier recording career.         But even then Ms. Clooney recorded pensive ballads like ''Tenderly'' and ''Hey There'' with such simplicity and beauty that they also became songs indelibly associated with her. Ms. Clooney with a good ballad was always approachable and intimate.         Her early career reached a height in 1954 when she appeared opposite Bing Crosby and Danny Kaye singing Irving Berlin songs in the hit musical ''White Christmas.'' But her good looks and cheery disposition masked a life with more than its share of pain.

And yet Ms. Clooney never completely lost her admiration for Mr. Ferrer, the father of her five children, whom she married and divorced twice, not even after she learned of his womanizing during their marriage that led her to conclude that he was breaking her heart ''in small increments.'' And she always made a place in her home for the parents who had not done the same for her when she was a child.         She was nominated for an Emmy award for an appearance on ''E.R.,'' the series that featured her nephew George Clooney, and this year she was given a lifetime achievement Grammy award a month after she was hospitalized for lung cancer surgery.         Rosemary Clooney was born May 23, 1928, in Maysville, Ky., a small town on the Ohio River southeast of Cincinnati. She was one of five children born to Andrew and Frances Guilfoyle Clooney. Mr. Clooney was a house painter who drank so much and so often that his own father, a jeweler who served several terms as mayor of Maysville, had his son jailed for public drunkenness. One of the Clooney children, Andy, drowned as a boy swimming in the Ohio River. But the others survived and remained close. They included Betty, who sang professionally for a while with Rosemary; and Nick, who became a television performer. Another sibling, Gail, did not venture into show business.         When Rosemary was 10 and in the fourth grade, she made her acting debut in a school production of ''Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs,'' in which she played the witch. That same year her paternal grandmother died, sending her father into an intensified period of drinking. Rosemary and her siblings were sent to live with her mother's family, the Guilfoyles. After Rosemary completed the sixth grade her grandmother took her to Ironton, Ohio, east of Maysville. Two years later, they moved to Cincinnati.         Rosemary and her sister Betty began to sing publicly, at first for political rallies for her grandfather, who was mayor of Maysville, later at amateur contests throughout northern Kentucky and southern Ohio.         When Rosemary was in high school and Betty was in junior high, radio station WLW in Cincinnati conducted a talent contest. The sisters won and for a time were heard seven nights a week, earning $20 each.         The sisters began to sing with Barney Rapp's big band, which performed around Cincinnati. An agent for Tony Pastor heard them, and for the next three years the Clooney Sisters became vocalists for the Pastor big band.         Grandmother Guilfoyle , who sewed as well as she could cook, made them dresses, and one of their uncles, George Guilfoyle, accompanied them on the band bus to make certain that they were not led astray by any of Mr. Pastor's musicians.         In 1946 Rosemary Clooney made her first solo recording, ''I'm Sorry I Didn't Say I'm Sorry When I Made You Cry Last Night,'' which attracted attention because she sang it in a whisper that disk jockeys speculated was going to be the new style. In reality, she had been so petrified when she stood before the microphone that she could not sing the song in full voice as she had intended.         By 1947 she was gaining notice. Downbeat magazine said she had ''an extraordinarily good voice, perhaps the nearest thing to Ella Fitzgerald we've ever heard.'' In 1948 Betty Clooney quit the Pastor band. Rosemary stayed another year before she left, hopeful of success because she had signed a contract with Columbia Records. The initial deal was that she would be paid $50 a recording, no matter how many copies it sold.         In 1950 she attracted favorable attention with an appearance on the ''Songs for Sale'' television show and with her recording of ''Beautiful Brown Eyes,'' her first real hit for Columbia. She started to appear regularly on television, including the Ed Sullivan show.         But her first megahit came the next year, when Mitch Miller, the artist and repertory man at Columbia, persuaded her to sing ''Come On-a My House.'' The song was based on something old and Armenian, updated by the novelist William Saroyan and Ross Bagdasarian, who later changed his name to David Seville and created the Chipmunks. From the instant that Ms. Clooney heard it she thought it was dreadful and told Mr. Miller she would not sing it, but he insisted, hinting broadly that if she refused, her career at Columbia might come to an end. The recording became a runaway best seller, and Ms. Clooney became a star.         The success emboldened Mr. Miller to assign her to other novelty songs, most notably ''Botcha Me'' and ''Mambo Italiano,'' which also became hits. When she made her screen debut in ''The Stars Are Singing,'' she was trumpeted as ''the next Betty Hutton,'' and she made the cover of Time magazine in 1953 with her bouncier image.         ''I always wanted to sing sad ballads, but I didn't get many opportunities,'' Ms. Clooney once told Stephen Holden of The Times. ''If I found something I wanted to do, I had to get permission. At the same time, you can't quarrel with success. If it hadn't been for 'Come on-a My House,' I probably wouldn't be here now.''         Ms. Clooney remained busy and successful for the rest of the 1950's. She fell in love with Dante DiPaolo, a dancer at Paramount studios, but jilted him to marry Mr. Ferrer in 1953 and to make more movies, including ''White Christmas'' in 1954 with Bing Crosby, Danny Kaye and Vera-Ellen.         In the early 1960's she and Mr. Ferrer became estranged, she had an affair with the arranger Nelson Riddle that went nowhere (he was married and the father of six children) and she slowly became addicted to sleeping pills. Her work habits became erratic, and she got tagged as being undependable. She found it difficult to find work. Her singing deteriorated.         By the end of the decade, she was ''dead behind the eyes,'' she recalled in her 1977 memoir, ''This for Remembrance.'' ''The records I did then sound like they were made underwater. I misbehaved with everyone, onstage and off.'' Her divorce from Mr. Ferrer became final in 1967.         In 1968 she supported the presidential aspirations of Senator Robert F. Kennedy and was standing near him when he was shot to death in Los Angeles by Sirhan Sirhan. Ms. Clooney, recalling the day in her memoir, said she was convinced that he hadn't died, that it was somehow all a big hoax.         Her self-destructive rampage continued until she spent a month in the psychiatric ward of Mount Sinai Hospital in Los Angeles. And when she emerged, she was short of money and supported herself by singing for anyone who would pay her. Mostly it was weekend work at Holiday Inns.         Her fortunes changed again in 1974 when Crosby asked her to appear with him at a show marking his 50th anniversary in show business. She did well and then made several successful tours with him and also toured with Margaret Whiting, Helen O'Connell and Rose Marie in a show called ''4 Girls 4.''         She suffered a setback in 1976 when her sister Betty died of an aneurysm but regained control of herself and worked on her memoirs.         Unexpectedly she ran into Mr. DiPaolo, who moved in with her and became her road manager, and in 1996 she married him in the church in Maysville where she had been baptized.         In the 1990's she recorded many songs for the Concord Jazz label, and the critics agreed that her voice had gotten better.         She is survived by her husband, Mr. DiPaolo; three sons, the actor Miguel Ferrer; Gabriel Ferrer, a painter and Episcopal priest married to Debby Boone; and the voice-over actor Rafael Ferrer; two daughters, Maria Murdoch, a designer; and Monsita Teresa Botwick; 10 grandchildren, her brother, Nick Clooney, and her sister, Gail Clooney Darley.         When she was in her 60's, Ms. Clooney said, ''If you hang around long enough, you get a lot of good stuff.'' Most of the time, she added, her life was pretty good.       
         Maritta M. Wolff, a novelist who burst onto the literary scene in 1941 with what Sinclair Lewis called ''the most important novel of the year'' and proceeded to write a string of vibrantly raw best sellers, died on July 1 at her home in Los Angeles. She was 83.         The novel, ''Whistle Stop,'' Ms. Wolff's first, became a movie of the same name starring George Raft and Ava Gardner. She wrote five more novels, then, without public explanation, stopped writing.         She married Leonard Stegman, who was in the costume jewelry business. She collected trinkets and bric-a-brac. For the final four decades of her life, her writing consisted of letters, many to fans who never tired of discussing the nuances of her plots and characters, Laura Stegman, her daughter-in-law, said.         It was not the destination that seemed likely when Ms. Wolff, at 22, wrote an 830-page story for a composition class at the University of Michigan and began her journey to the summits of the literary world. In 1940, the story won her the Avery Hopwood Prize, awarded along with $1,000 for excellent writing by University of Michigan students.         In 1941, the work appeared as ''Whistle Stop,'' trimmed to 450 pages and bubbling with gritty, robust dialogue. It surged through five printings and a miniaturized armed forces edition that so captivated soldiers and sailors that many sent fan letters. They particularly yearned to know the nature of the relationship between the sibling characters Kenny and Mary.         ''We in Barracks No. 2 have examined the situation from all angles -- and I do mean all angles -- and we can reach no satisfactory solution,'' a soldier wrote in 1945.         The answer was that what seemed to be incest was exactly that, but subtly portrayed. It was typical of Ms. Wolff's work: she pulled no punches, yet exhibited the gifted storyteller's delicate, essentially indescribable grasp of human nature.         Edith H. Walton wrote in her review of ''Whistle Stop'' in The New York Times Book Review: ''Because this is a very unusual book, and a strongly individual one, I am conscious that I have not really succeeded in conveying its flavor. That flavor is acrid, tangy, humorous, robust -- yet beneath all the humor there is a bitter and genuine emotion.''         Ms. Wolff's feel for the rhythms of speech -- developed in coffee shops and bars -- had much to do with the impact. A sample passage from her first novel:         ''Well, I gotta get dressed up all beautiful. Who knows, tonight, I might meet a great big beautiful man with a job and an automobile and he might take just one look at me and say, 'Baby, I'm nuts about you,' and I might just take one good look at him and say . . .''         Orville Prescott, in a 1942 review in The New York Times of ''Night Shift,'' Ms. Wolff's second book, called her feel for the American language phenomenal.         ''One feels certain that this is a scientifically exact record of the speech of factory workers in an automobile bumper plant, of taxi drivers, waitresses in cheap restaurants, beautiful dumb women and beautiful smart ones who haunt small-time night clubs,'' Mr. Prescott wrote.         Maritta Martin Wolff was born on Dec. 25, 1918, on a farm near Grass Lake, Mich., and grew up watching people, including those at the one-room country school she attended.         ''My one hobby was developing, as far back as I can remember, an inordinate interest in people and anything and everything happening to them,'' she wrote.         As soon as she learned penmanship, she began to write. Or, as she later put it, take dictation.         ''My characters have a habit of getting their own ideas,'' she told The Akron Beacon Journal in 1944. ''They tell me mine are goofy. They run away and do as they please.''         As did she. She refused to publicize her books, becoming more adamant as her career progressed and publishers demanded more of authors. Family lore says that was why she stopped writing.         At the University of Michigan, she met Hubert Skidmore, whom she married. Mr. Skidmore had written six novels by the time he was 30, including ''Hawk's Nest,'' about an industrial accident in West Virginia.         He died in a house fire in 1946. The next year, Ms. Wolff married Mr. Stegman, who survives her, as does their son, Hugh, of Los Angeles.         The reaction to ''Whistle Stop'' could hardly have been more enthusiastic, not least because of her searing language and hotter plots. A review by Clifton Fadiman in The New Yorker said, ''If she can write this way at 22, she should be good for a banning in Boston before she's 25.''         She wrote more books: ''About Lyddy Thomas'' (1947), ''Back of Town'' (1952), ''The Big Nickelodeon'' (1956) and ''Buttonwood'' (1962).         Then Ms. Wolff disappeared. Her writing seemed limited to correspondence and detailed records of repairs and oil changes for the silver Jaguar she loved to drive.         Her refrigerator has contained a complete, unpublished novel for years, her family said.       
         Emily Genauer, an art critic who championed 20th-century painting and sculpture over the course of a four-decade newspaper career and won a Pulitzer Prize for criticism, died on Friday after a long illness. She was 91.         Starting out as the critic for The New York World in the 1930's, Ms. Genauer made it her mission to introduce modern artists like Marc Chagall and Diego Rivera to a newspaper audience. She also staunchly defended art's independence from politics. In 1949, she left The New York World-Telegram after an argument with its owner, Roy W. Howard, who thought she was paying too much attention to artists he considered ''Communists and left-wingers,'' like Pablo Picasso.         Ms. Genauer's columns for The New York Herald Tribune, where she was chief art critic from 1949 to 1966, were also watched closely by artists. In 1992 she recalled how the painter Clyfford Still, about whom she had written unfavorably, sent her a pair of rubber baby pants with a card. The card read: ''Hoping this will aid in concealing your Sunday affliction. With the compliments of Clyfford Still.''         She tried to promote lesser-known artists. While visiting the East Side town house of John Hay Whitney, the owner of The Herald Tribune, she urged him to purchase more 20th-century art. She took him to a communal studio-gallery of avant-garde artists on the Bowery, directly opposite that neighborhood's leading flophouse. After getting out of his limousine and hesitantly stepping around some drunks, he bought a number of paintings.         The author of numerous books, Ms. Genauer was also a member of the National Council on the Humanities from 1966 to 1970.         Emily Genauer was born July 19, 1911, in Staten Island, where her father owned several delicatessens and was an amateur sculptor. She attended Hunter College and the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism, and began writing for The New York World in 1929. She always retained her maiden name as a byline, though after marrying Frederick Gash she took his last name in her private life.         The World paid her by the word, allowing her to make as much as $92 per week, she recalled in 1992. Then she got a call from an editor who told her she was to be paid a salary. ''Aren't you happy?'' the editor asked. ''You're now on staff. Your fee will be $35 a week.''         After The World went out of business and was merged with The New York Telegram, she continued to write for the paper until 1949. That year, United States Representative George A. Dondero issued a warning about Communist sympathies seeping into American life, and mentioned art criticism as a danger zone, citing Ms. Genauer by name, she recalled in a 1992 speech.         ''My brother telephoned me afterwards and said, 'When did you go Communist?' '' she said.         Mr. Howard, her editor, told her she could no longer write about Picasso. She promptly announced her resignation, and then used Mr. Howard's phone to call the editor of The Herald Tribune, who promptly offered her the job as art critic.         In 1966, The Herald Tribune merged with two other newspapers to become The New York World Journal Tribune, and she became its art critic until its demise in 1967. She then wrote a weekly column for the Newsday Syndicate until the mid-1970's. In 1974 she won the Pulitzer Prize for distinguished art criticism.         Ms. Genauer is survived by a sister, Blanche Wahl of Baltimore; a daughter, Constance Gash Roche, of New York City; and two grandchildren.         ''I could do it for 60 years because I'd rather look at art than anything else,'' Ms. Genauer said of art criticism in 1992, ''because I love the art world and because every day was different than every other.''

         Diane J. Lipton, who fought for the rights of her disabled daughter and went on to become a lawyer and prominent advocate for children with disabilities, died on Aug. 8 at her home in Richmond, Calif. She was 57.         The cause was a rare form of lung cancer, her husband, James Armstrong, said.         Her daughter Chloe had cerebral palsy and developmental delays. In 1979, when Chloe was 7, the Richmond Unified School District reduced her occupational training sessions to one a week from three. Ms. Lipton and other parents demanded that the school district restore the sessions and change its complaint procedures.         By the time the battle ended in 1987, Ms. Lipton had won what she and other advocates considered a major civil rights battle. The district had closed its four schools for pupils with disabilities and integrated them into regular schools.         Her winning tactic had been persuading federal officials in Washington to temporarily cut off money for the education of disabled children in all California schools until the Richmond situation was remedied.         The result was a new state policy to end the segregation of disabled children. Ms. Lipton took the issue a step further in 1990 when she and other advocates for the disabled took the Sacramento school district to court to demand the mixing of disabled children into regular classrooms.         In 1994, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco decided the case in Ms. Lipton's favor and defined standards for judging whether school districts were complying with the 1975 federal law requiring that disabled students be educated to the maximum extent possible and with other children as much as possible.         Diane Julie Zelman was born on June 13, 1945, in Forest Hills, Queens, where she grew up. She graduated from the University of California with an English major and experience in many campus demonstrations. She married Lennie Lipton, a campus activist and co-writer of the song ''Puff the Magic Dragon.''         In 1972, Chloe was born, the only one of triplets to survive. Ms. Lipton became friendly with parents of other disabled children, and Chloe at 3 began to attend a school for orthopedically handicapped children. In 1974, Ms. Lipton began a master's-degree course in rehabilitation counseling at San Francisco State University, graduating in 1976.         She divorced around 1979. Within two years, she had become a parent advocate with the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund and was organizing a statewide campaign to integrate the Richmond schools, traveling to Washington to press for the cutoff in money. At night, she earned a law degree at Golden Gate University.         In 1980, she married Mr. Armstrong, whom she had met at a union meeting for rehabilitation workers.         Her passion in the initial battle was fueled by a chain-link fence that separated Chloe's special education school from what was considered a conventional school. The only time the students were allowed to mingle was on Halloween, when they were in costume. Ms. Lipton thought this indicated that school officials regarded disabled students as freaks, Arlene Mayerson, a lawyer for the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund, said.         Ms. Lipton is survived by her husband; Chloe, who, with some help, lives on her own in Emeryville, Calif.; and a daughter from her second marriage, Daria Armstrong.       
         Nancy Chaffee Whitaker, a leading tennis player in the 1950's who won three consecutive national indoor championships, died Sunday in Coronado, Calif. She was 73 and lived in Indian Wells, Calif.         The cause was complications of cancer, said her husband, the sportscaster Jack Whitaker.         In the early 50's, Nancy Chaffee vied for tennis supremacy with figures like Maureen Connolly, Althea Gibson, Margaret Osborne duPont, Doris Hart, Louise Brough and Shirley Fry.         She was the national indoor titleholder from 1950 to 1952, defeating Gibson, Beverly Baker and Patricia Todd in the finals, long before the open era and the advent of huge prize money. The indoor tournaments were played on the boards at the Seventh Regiment Armory on Park Avenue in Manhattan before perhaps 2,000 fans at the final rounds.         ''What did I win?'' Chaffee Whitaker said in a 1993 interview. ''A little silver ball and a silver ashtray with a glass base, and I don't even smoke. No money.''         Comparing the modern game with her era, she said: ''There are more better players. When I was playing I was an automatic almost into the semifinals of any tournament. That's just the way it was, a gap between the few top players and the rest. And there was no qualifying for tournaments.''         The daughter of a tennis instructor and a native of Ventura, Calif., she played on the men's tennis team at the University of Southern California because there was no women's squad. While a sophomore, she captured the 1947 United States girls' lawn tennis singles championship and teamed with Baker to win the doubles title.         She emerged in the national spotlight in 1950, reaching the singles quarterfinals at Wimbledon and the singles semifinals of the United States nationals -- the forerunner of the United States Open -- in addition to winning the first of her indoor championships.         In 1951, she teamed with Todd in doubles at the nationals, losing in the final to Fry and Hart, and she played doubles on the 1951 Wightman Cup team that defeated Britain, 6-1.         She was married in October 1951 to Ralph Kiner, the Pittsburgh Pirates' slugger and future Hall of Famer, and retired from most tournament play after winning the 1952 indoor title, devoting herself to rearing a family.         She was later a sports commentator for ABC, developed tennis programs at resorts and helped found the Cartier tennis tournament in Long Island's Hamptons to benefit the American Cancer Society.         In addition to Whitaker, whom she married in 1991, she is survived by three children from her marriage to Kiner, the longtime Mets broadcaster; sons Michael and Scott Kiner, and a daughter, Kathryn Freeman, all of Palm Desert, Calif.; and five grandchildren.       
         Lucia Pamela, a one-of-a-kind entertainer best known for recording a music album in 1969 about her fictional travels to the moon, died on July 25 in a hospital in Los Angeles, where she lived. She was 98.         Until 1992, Ms. Pamela's only album, ''Into Outer Space With Lucia Pamela,'' was all but forgotten. Irwin Chusid, a radio disc jockey, helped revive her career and produced a reissue of her album. When a small independent label, Arf Arf, reissued it on CD that year, record collectors around the world took note. Not only were the homemade lyrics and songs unusual and full of infectious childlike optimism and sincerity (she truly believed she had gone to the moon), but her background was equally compelling.         Ms. Pamela's story is a mixture of fact and self-invention. She claimed, for example, to be the first person ever on television and radio; that Ignace Paderewski told her mother she would be the finest pianist in the world; that she was kicked out of a German music conservatory for being overqualified. Relatives said there were grains of truth in all these stories.         Ms. Pamela was born in St. Louis, and her mother was a concert pianist and composer. In 1926, Ms. Pamela won the title of Miss St. Louis. After performing in St. Louis theaters, she moved to Fresno, Calif., where she managed the Fresno Storyland amusement park (she also played Mother Goose there). She was also the host of two radio shows for young women, ''The Encouragement Hour'' and ''Gal About Town.''         Ms. Pamela formed what some say was the country's first all-female orchestra, Lucia Pamela and the Musical Pirates, in which she claimed to have played 15 instruments. With her daughter, Georgia, she formed the vocal duo the Pamela Sisters. Nowadays her daughter, Georgia Frontiere, is best known as the owner of the St. Louis Rams. Ms. Pamela married several times, the last time to Billy Angelo, a professional prizefighter, who died in 1987.         Ms. Pamela is also survived by a son, Ken Irwin of Palm Springs, Calif.; 12 grandchildren; and 27 great-grandchildren.         A documentary on her life is being completed by Danielle Lemaire, a Belgian artist.         One of Ms. Pamela's proudest accomplishments, she liked to say, was building a rocket, touring the Milky Way and stopping on the moon to record her album. With the feel of a warped bebop children's album, it features Ms. Pamela on all instruments -- piano, accordion, drums, clarinet, and probably various household appliances -- accompanying herself as she tells, with gee-whiz glee, tales of amiable lunar roosters, trips to Mars and blue winds. At 65, she sang of a world where anything was possible and everything was shot through with an innocent joy, excitement and imagination.         The album was released in 1969 on a small label, Gulfstream, and signed copies are said to fetch as much as $1,000. She also created a coloring book that tells the story of a moon trip in which she met cows, Indians and anthropomorphic cashews. ''Some of the people there spoke Almond,'' she wrote.         A tireless entertainer, Ms. Pamela was cited by ''Ripley's Believe It or Not'' for having memorized some 10,000 songs. The English band Stereolab even wrote a song about her, ''International Colouring Contest.'' She performed at Las Vegas hotels into her 80's.         ''It was recorded on Moontown,'' Ms. Pamela said of her album. ''I was the only one from Earth there.''       
         Katrin Cartlidge, a British actress celebrated for the boldness of her performances in films by Mike Leigh and other independent directors, died on Saturday in London. She was 41 and lived in London.         The Associated Press reported that she died of septicemia resulting from pneumonia. But that cause was not confirmed. Ms. Cartlidge had entered a hospital with ''flulike symptoms,'' said a representative of the actress's agent.         Ms. Cartlidge also had a flourishing stage career, and played a leading role in ''Mnemonic,'' Simon McBurney's production for the Theatre de Complicite, which had a long run off Broadway last year. In that ensemble play, she acted opposite Mr. McBurney as a woman searching the world for a father she never knew.         Writing in The Guardian this week, Mr. McBurney said that Ms. Cartlidge was ''the play's motor and its energizer'' and added that she was ''one of the brightest, innovative, fearless and most passionately committed performers on screen and stage to have emerged from Britain for many years.''         Her breakthrough came in films, beginning in 1993 with Mr. Leigh's ''Naked,'' in which she played the druggie Sophie opposite David Thewlis's drifter. In 1997 she starred as Hannah, a cheeky hell-raiser, in Mr. Leigh's ''Career Girls'' (about two college roommates who renew their relationship many years later). For ''Career Girls,'' she won an Evening Standard award as best actress.         Through her work with Mr. Leigh and others, by 2000 she had become internationally prominent. She specialized in playing offbeat, unglamorous roles and never seemed daunted even when they bordered on the outrageous. She had featured roles in Milcho Manchevski's ''Before the Rain,'' Lars von Trier's ''Breaking the Waves'' (as Emily Watson's sister-in-law) and Lodge Kerrigan's ''Claire Dolan'' (as an Irish immigrant who becomes a prostitute in New York). In Danis Tanovic's ''No Man's Land,'' which won an Academy Award this year as best foreign film, she played a cold, ambitious battlefield journalist.         ''I think it's wonderful that women can start playing characters with more than a couple of sides, some of them not pleasant,'' she said. ''Audiences are not used to seeing characters like Hannah or Sophie, who are not trying to get us to fall in love with them. But why do we always have to fall in love with our leading ladies? Why can't we be just intrigued or puzzled or horrified or amused?''         Ms. Cartlidge was born in London. She began her stage career in fringe theaters, but soon moved on to the Royal National Theater and other major companies, and continued to act onstage after her film career took flight. After ''Mnemonic,'' she starred in London in the Royal Court production of Rebecca Gilman's ''Boy Gets Girl,'' as a woman pursued by a stalker.         She is survived by her parents, Bobbi and Derek, of London; a brother, Tony, of California; a sister, Michele, of Cornwall; and her partner, Peter Gevisser.         In an interview in The New York Times in 1997 she spoke about her character in ''Career Girls,'' a film ''about a couple of women who get older.'' She said: ''I actually love getting older. I hated my 20's; I couldn't wait to be 30. I'm really looking forward to turning 40, if I get there. And not just because things are more successful now, but because I think the older you get, the more you find life interesting apart from your own problems.'' And, with a wave of her hand, she added: ''So roll on. I can't wait.''       
         Marjorie Slaiman, the longtime costume designer for the Arena Stage theater company in Washington, died on Sept. 13 at a hospital in Fairfax, Va. She was 77 and lived in Washington.         The cause was complications from heart surgery, her family said.         In her 26-year career with Arena Stage Ms. Slaiman designed thousands of costumes for more than 130 productions, including the 1967 premiere of ''The Great White Hope'' with James Earl Jones and Jane Alexander, which alone required more than 230 costumes.         She also worked on Arena Stage's productions of ''Our Town'' and ''Inherit the Wind,'' which both toured the Soviet Union in 1973.         Her credits on Broadway include Arthur Kopit's ''Indians,'' Studs Terkel's ''Working'' and Elie Wiesel's ''Zalmen, or the Madness of God.'' Ms. Slaiman won the first Helen Hayes Award for her costume design for ''Man and Superman'' in 1985 and was nominated for seven more Hayes awards before her retirement in 1993.         Born Marjorie Lawler in the Bronx, she graduated from the New York School of Industrial Art and got her start designing lingerie in New York and costumes for the Shakespeare Theater Festival in Washington during the 1960's.         She is survived by four children, Gary, of McLean, Va.; Donald, of Columbus, Ohio; Lauren, of Manhattan; and Tracey Barrentine of Annandale, Va.; five brothers, John Lawler of Yonkers; Lawrence Lawler of Mamaroneck, N.Y.; Robert Lawler of Seaford, N.Y.; Brendan Lawler, of Katonah, N.Y.; and James Lawler, of Staten Island; four sisters, Therese Lawler Stevenson of Bedford, N.Y.; Kathleen Lawler Gerard of Cortlandt Manor, N.Y.; Patricia Lawler Odell of Parlin, N.J.; and Joan Lawler Cirone of San Luis Obispo, Calif.; and six grandchildren.       
         Joan Littlewood, the producer, director and author who was one of the most important and original figures responsible for the regeneration of the British theater in the 1950's and 60's, died Friday in London at the home of her assistant. She was 87.         Ms. Littlewood's Theater Workshop, based in a shabby old playhouse in a poor section of East London, won an international reputation with seasons of offbeat work that she staged by herself. These included ''Oh What a Lovely War,'' a vaudeville-style re-creation of key events in the First World War; ''The Quare Fellow'' and ''The Hostage,'' two plays by her prot√©g√©, the Irish dramatist Brendan Behan; and ''A Taste of Honey,'' a bleak portrait of life in Northern England by the 18-year-old Shelagh Delaney.         As early as 1956 the critic Harold Hobson could declare that Theater Workshop was known throughout Europe as ''England's premier company.''         As much as the kitchen-sink drama of John Osborne and others, which started to appear the same year, Joan Littlewood was responsible for what she called ''the destruction of complacent, well-behaved middle-class theater.''         She demonstrated to the British that lively work could be produced on a shoestring, that tight-knit ensembles were likely to produce better work than ad hoc casts, and that performers and dramatists did not need to suppress their working-class identities in order to succeed.         ''Theater should be grand, vulgar, simple, pathetic,'' Ms. Littlewood said, but ''not genteel, not poetical.''         It was her exuberant energy and feisty informality that once provoked Laurence Olivier to remark ruefully: ''I wish I could work that way. But I'm a trained parrot.''         Joan Maud Littlewood was born in London in 1914, the daughter of a 16-year-old unmarried housemaid. School trips to the Old Vic, and in particular to John Gielgud's performance as Hamlet, bred in her a love of the theater and she won a coveted scholarship to the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. But she was very much the Cockney outsider in a school she later described as being full of ''debs and rich Americans acquiring English accents.'' She dropped out and made her way, mostly on foot, to the northern city of Manchester, where she got a job in a local repertory theater.         She quickly decided, however, that ''curtain theater'' was not for her. An instinctive radicalism, combined with habitual restlessness, impelled her toward theater work in which, as she later wrote, everything was created by the actors on a bare platform: ''tempest, sun and rain, rivers, storm-tossed seas.''         With Jimmy Miller, who wrote plays under the name of Ewan McColl and was to become her husband, she formed an agitprop group in Manchester called Theater of Action and then created a company called Theater Union, which introduced the British to the American concept called the Living Newspaper, improvisations based on the day's news. After the war this evolved into Theater Workshop, which toured with plays of social or political significance both in Britain and on the Continent.         The company's reputation grew, but its finances remained shaky, provoking George Bernard Shaw to tell Ms. Littlewood that her company ''should all go and be stockbrokers -- the English don't want art.'' The actors paid for one tour by picking tomatoes in the country and selling them at a profit in Manchester.         Tiring of squalid surroundings, Ms. Littlewood decided in 1953 to settle her players in the Theater Royal, a dilapidated Victorian playhouse in the area of London described in Chaucer's ''Canterbury Tales'' as Stratford-atte-Bowe, but now simply known as Stratford East. This caused a permanent breach with Mr. Miller, who feared the move to London would compromise the company's radicalism, and was itself financially risky.         For many months the actors slept in hammocks in the auditorium, shared what little box-office income there was and seldom earned more than $3 a week each. For this they were also expected to paint, decorate and clean the theater as well as perform.         Even in the 1960's, when the theater was internationally renowned, Ms. Littlewood herself was to be found washing the steps before opening nights, reportedly snapping at one passing actor, ''I'm expecting company -- what about you?'' That hospitality and lack of pretension found its way into productions that combined simple staging and dramatic gusto with a determination to break down the conventional barriers between actors and audiences.         Spectators might find themselves directly addressed by characters. There was so much good-natured improvisation that the company was prosecuted for breaching censorship laws, which remained in force in Britain until 1968. Evenings would often end with cheerful gatherings in the theater bar, maybe with Behan or another maverick orchestrating the fun.         Ms. Littlewood met Behan after his incongruously exuberant attack on capital punishment, ''The Quare Fellow'' landed in an inky, tattered bundle on her desk in 1956. She helped him radically revise it, transferred it from Stratford to the West End and so thoroughly took control of his career that he once described himself as ''a creature of Joan's imagination.''         She said she was on the floor, holding Behan's legs to his chair, while he gave a notoriously incoherent, drunken interview in the BBC studios. She also calmed the police when they brought him to the Theater Royal after finding him at the wheel of a ferry on the Thames, saying he was crossing the Missouri. Later she took Behan's Irish Republican Army play, ''The Hostage,'' to the West End and on to New York. But she was unable to stem the drinking that was to kill him in 1964 while he was working on his final piece for the Theater Royal, ''Richard's Cork Leg.''         Among the other plays Ms. Littlewood edited into dramatic shape was ''A Taste of Honey,'' about a white Lancashire girl who becomes pregnant after an affair with a black sailor. The manuscript was sent to her by the teenage Shelagh Delaney with this note: ''I am sending this play to you for your opinion. Would you please return it to me, as whatever sort of theatrical atrocity it is to you it means something to me.''         Ms. Littlewood put the play into rehearsal within two weeks, and it had its first performance at the Theater Royal in May 1958. It went on to the West End and Broadway, providing personal triumphs for Joan Plowright, who played the girl onstage, and Rita Tushingham, who played her in Tony Richardson's 1961 film.         The improvised ''Oh What A Lovely War,'' which brought Theater Workshop its greatest success, was a satire of World War I done in 1963 as a music hall revue with the actors in black-and-white commedia dell'arte costumes. It was later staged on Broadway and made into an all-star film in 1969 by Richard Attenborough. ''Oh What a Lovely War'' used war records, memoirs, speeches and the beloved songs of the Great War -- among them ''Pack Up Your Troubles,'' ''It's a Long Way to Tipperary,'' and ''Keep the Home Fires Burning'' -- to, as Ms. Littlewood put it, ''mock the absurdity, the vulgarity of war.''         She also gave William Saroyan's ''Sam, the Highest Jumper of Them All'' its world premiere, enjoyed success with Wolf Mankowitz's ''Make Me an Offer'' and the ex-convict Frank Norman's ''Fings Ain't What They Used to Be,'' and discovered talent that ranged from John Bury, later the National Theater's head of design, to Richard Harris, who played Macbeth for her.         Though she was best known for staging new work, she directed many classic plays, usually in a rough style that emphasized their immediacy and topicality.         ''If I have to choose between the gods and the clowns, I'll take the clowns,'' Ms. Littlewood once said. ''They're close to the commedia dell'arte and that's what I'm trying to get close to. There's so much nonsense about theater being this or that. Who needs a National Theater? We've already got enough museums.'' She continued: ''My idea is to open doors, to create a community, a meeting place. My doors are open to anyone, to any prostitute or gangster.''         In ''Joan's Book,'' her autobiography, published in 1994, she described herself as ''plain, moody, often amusing sometimes.'' She was known for being tough, combative, ribald and generous. In the words of Philip Hedley, the current director of the Theater Royal, she ''loved conflict, enjoyed provoking, and could demolish people -- and then make them a meal in the green room.''         Though she never married Gerry Raffles, Theater Workshop's general manager, he became her partner and the most significant person in her life. After his death in 1975 she left London for France, where she lived as a recluse. That ended her much-publicized plan to build a ''fun palace'' in East London where people from backgrounds like her own might join in cultural activities of every kind.         She left no immediate survivors. As experimental theater groups sprung up all over London and all around the world, she once said, as The Guardian reported in its obituary: ''I didn't need to have children. All over the world I have children.''       
         Stephanie Reinhart, an innovative arts administrator who had an international impact in promoting new trends in contemporary dance as co-director of the American Dance Festival and as co-artistic director for dance at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington, died on Monday in Manhattan. She was 58 and lived in Durham, N.C., and Manhattan.         The cause was leukemia, her husband, Charles L. Reinhart, said.         Ms. Reinhart usually worked in tandem with her husband, who became the festival's director in 1969 after a pioneering career, begun in the 1950's, in producing and managing modern dance companies as well as developing dance projects for the National Endowment for the Arts and State Department cultural exchange programs.         The Reinharts' joint activities included the highly praised Balanchine Festival two years ago at the Kennedy Center and ''Free to Dance,'' a documentary film for public television about black dance for which the Reinharts just won an Emmy Award as its executive producers. They commissioned many works by both novice and veteran choreographers, including Paul Taylor and Merce Cunningham.         Ms. Reinhart was a staff member at the National Endowment for the Arts in its early years and joined the American Dance Festival in 1977. When Martha Clarke, the choreographer and director, left Pilobolus Dance Theater in the early 1980's to form her own dance company, Crows Nest, Ms. Reinhart served as her manager, consultant and fund-raiser. With her sharp analytic eye and her tireless support of original talent, Ms. Reinhart was also president of the board of directors of Laura Dean Dancers and Musicians.         Ms. Reinhart placed equally consistent emphasis on preserving the traditions of modern dance. She established a national touring program for the Dayton Contemporary Dance Theater's revivals of rarely performed classics by black choreographers.         Ms. Reinhart and her husband, who married in 1977, were indefatigable in seeking out new choreographers from abroad. They were the first to introduce Butoh, the experimental Japanese genre with apocalyptic themes, to the United States. Together they braved a windy outdoor performance on a cold mountain top in Japan to see Dai Rakuda Kan, the Butoh group they presented at the American Dance Festival's home at Duke University in 1982.         The Reinharts also presented the Japanese-born neo-Butoh performers Eiko and Koma. ''Stephanie was very personal and encouraged us artists to be personal as well,'' this avant-garde duo said in a statement on Monday. ''We know there are many dance artists in the world who were as encouraged as we were by her quiet enthusiasm. Stephanie strongly believed what dance can deliver. Her belief made all of us, coming from different countries and different cultures, into one family.''         Similarly, the Reinharts were the first to familiarize Americans with the nascent French contemporary dance boom after they traveled to France to select five troupes for the festival in 1983, and Ms. Reinhart was awarded the medal of Chevalier of the Order of Arts and Letters this month for her contributions to furthering dance in France and throughout the world.         Ms. Reinhart frequently visited Europe and Latin America to see choreographers unfamiliar in the United States. The Reinharts' often-stated belief was that modern dance was a prime indigenous American art form that spread worldwide in the last three decades.         Convinced that young dancers abroad were interested in studying the idioms of modern dance, they organized workshops in Japan, South Korea and Russia. They also helped establish the Guangdong Modern Dance Company, China's first modern dance troupe.         Unlike her husband, Ms. Reinhart did not begin her career specifically in dance but in broader area of arts administration. Born in Washington, she graduated with honors from the University of Wisconsin in 1966. She received a fellowship for graduate work in American literary and cultural history at George Washington University and attended the Harvard University Summer Institute in Arts Administration in 1974.         After the National Endowment for the Arts was established in 1965, Ms. Reinhart became part of the first generation of professionally trained arts administrators. She joined the Endowment in 1969 and was program administrator for its Dance and Education Programs, also working in the planning and development of the Artists-in-Schools Program.         In 1996 the Reinharts were named Artistic Directors for Dance at the Kennedy Center. They inaugurated an energetic and innovative commissioning program for collaborations by jazz composers and modern dance companies with funds from the Doris Duke Charitable Trust.         In addition to her husband, Ms. Reinhart is survived by her daughter, Ariane M. Reinhart of New York; her mother, Florence Keren of Washington; and three stepsons, Taylor, of Los Angeles; Adam, of Honolulu; and Scott, of Geneseo, N.Y.       
         Erna Furman, an expert on grief in children and a child psychoanalyst who helped develop a teamwork therapy involving teachers, parents and therapists, died on Aug. 9 in Cleveland. She was 76.         The cause was lung cancer, said a spokeswoman for the Hanna Perkins Center for Child Development, where she worked for about 50 years.         The Perkins Center used psychoanalytic ideas to help children deal with emotional problems and incorporated the idea of team treatment, which helped parents understand children's actions.         Mrs. Furman wrote, edited and contributed to books based on research at the center.         The book ''A Child's Parent Dies: Studies in Childhood Bereavement,'' which she worked on with the psychoanalyst Dr. Anna Freud in the 1970's, challenged the idea that children who lose a parent do not need the same attention that adults do. She showed that even toddlers can be helped to mourn a parent. The work won the American Medical Writers Association Book Award in 1975.         Mrs. Furman's book ''Toddlers and Their Mothers'' describes her findings from a 1980's research project on the importance of the mother-child relationship, particularly in the second and third years of life.         Mrs. Furman was born Erna Mary Poppe in Vienna on June 14, 1926. In 1938, her family fled to Czechoslovakia to escape the Nazis. Four years later, however, she was sent to the Terezin concentration camp, near Prague.         While there, she kept a journal and drew portraits of other captives, many of them children whom she befriended and helped care for. Some of her drawings were later exhibited, to critical acclaim, in museums, including ones in Tokyo and Los Angeles.         Mrs. Furman, who was educated at the Academy of Commerce in Prague, came to the United States in the late 1940's. She received many honors for her contributions to child psychoanalysis and was made an honorary member of the American Psychoanalytic Association in 1999.         Dr. Robert Furman, her husband of 48 years and her colleague, died Sept. 21 at 78. He was known for helping develop the Hannah Perkins Center and the Cleveland Center for Research in Child Development. He was the first director of the Hannah Perkins Center.         ''In many ways, it was the couple together, Dr. and Mrs. Furman, who made the Hannah Perkins Center what it is today,'' said Barbara Streeter, the center's therapy director.         The Furmans are survived by two daughters, Lydia Furman Peter of Cleveland and Tanya Furman Larson of State College, Pa.; and three grandchildren.         Correction:  October 9, 2002, Wednesday  An obituary on Sept. 30 about Erna Furman, a child psychoanalyst and an expert on grief, gave a misspelled name in some references to the center where she practiced. It is the Hanna Perkins Center for Child Development, not Hannah. Because of an editing error, Mrs. Furman's maiden name was misspelled. It was Popper, not Poppe. The article misstated the timing of Mrs. Furman's immigration to the United States. It occurred in the 1950's, not the 40's.         The obituary also misstated the role of the psychoanalyst Anna Freud in Mrs. Furman's book ''A Child's Parent Dies: Studies in Childhood Bereavement.'' Dr. Freud wrote an introduction; she did not contribute to the text.       
         Kim Hunter, whose eclectic 60-year career included an Oscar, two Emmy nominations and a Broadway triumph with her portrayal of Stella in the legendary 1947 debut of ''A Streetcar Named Desire,'' died on Wednesday at her New York apartment. She was 79.         A founding member of the Actors Studio whose screen career was temporarily derailed by the Hollywood blacklists of the 1950's, Ms. Hunter was recently hospitalized for a fall and had been in declining health. She died of a heart attack in her apartment above the Cherry Lane Theater in the West Village, said her daughter, Kathryn Emmett.         Ms. Hunter caught the acting bug in elementary school and was never a snob about the roles she chose, mixing highly demanding parts with smaller ones in B-movies, long stints in regional theater, television guest appearance and even a running role on an ABC soap opera, ''The Edge of Night,'' in 1979 and 1980.         But without doubt the roles for which she is most remembered are Stella Kowalski, Marlon Brando's passionate and beleaguered wife in the stage and film versions of Tennessee Williams's ''Streetcar Named Desire,'' and Dr. Zira, the coquettish simian with a fondness for Charlton Heston in the 1968 film ''Planet of the Apes.''         The role of Stella also won her an Academy Award for best supporting actress when the director Elia Kazan adapted his Broadway production to the screen. The scenes of an anguished Stanley Kowalski (Mr. Brando), disheveled and grimy, screaming up to his wife -- ''Stella!'' -- in the backyard of their seedy New Orleans home, and of Ms. Hunter's sexually charged descent on a winding staircase into his arms, have become iconic cinematic moments.         Feisty, occasionally profane, Ms. Hunter frequently told interviewers that she had no use for the trappings of Hollywood stardom that had always eluded her.         ''The work itself has been my life,'' she said in 1999. ''I was never in this for jazzy stardom, and as far as that's concerned, I've never had it. Doesn't matter to me.''         Ms. Hunter was born in Detroit, and her father died four years later. Her mother and stepfather moved the family to Miami Beach when she was 10, and there she developed a taste for the theater.         ''I was lonely growing up,'' she said. ''My only brother was nine years older and had little time for me. So I picked friends out of books and played let's-pretend games, acting out their characters before a mirror.''         Before long she had an acting coach and made her stage debut at 17 in the title role of ''Penny Wise'' at the Miami Women's Club. Later she took roles with stock companies around the country. At the Pasadena Playhouse in California, in ''Arsenic and Old Lace,'' she was spotted by a talent scout and signed to a contract with the producer David O. Selznick.         For her 1943 screen debut, Selznick loaned her to the horror-film producer Val Lewton, for whom she played a young woman battling devil worshipers in ''The Seventh Victim.''         Shortly afterward, Ms. Hunter took a supporting role in the Ginger Rogers film ''Tender Comrade,'' about young women living communally during World War II, a film that struck some as pro-Soviet. It was cited, years later, as a reason that her name appeared in ''Red Channels,'' a 1950's pamphlet naming suspected Communist sympathizers.         Ms. Hunter, a liberal Democrat, had been a vocal supporter of civil rights, though she never belonged to the Communist Party. She said she traced her problems with the blacklist to a world peace symposium that she helped sponsor in 1949. No one ever announced that she was on a blacklist, she said.         ''Gradually it became sort of clear,'' she said. ''I think CBS was first. I was on the blacklist at CBS. No more CBS television. Then I think ABC dropped out and then, finally, it was NBC. And then by that time, I won my Oscar for the movie of 'Streetcar,' but I could not work in films. The last film I made was in 1951.''         Her hiatus from the screen lasted until 1956, when she appeared opposite Bette Davis in ''Storm Center,'' about book-burning. ''I thought, uh-oh, here we go again,'' she said. But her political problems did not reignite.         Ms. Hunter was one of the few forgiving voices when many in Hollywood rebelled against awarding Mr. Kazan a special Oscar in 1999. He had never apologized for naming names to Congressional investigators during the blacklist days.         ''The whole business is dumb,'' she told one interviewer. ''Artistic achievement and the mistake someone made years ago don't belong together.''         The ''Streetcar'' role came about because Selznick's wife Irene remembered the actress when it came time to cast the role of Stella. The play opened at the Ethel Barrymore Theater in New York, but rehearsals were held on the roof of the New Amsterdam Theater.         ''Tennessee sat way in the back and when he had a thought about something, he'd write a note and come down to where we were working, reach over and tuck the note into Kazan's coat pocket,'' Ms. Hunter said.         Reviewing the production in The New York Times, Brooks Atkinson praised the entire cast. ''All act not only with color and style, but with insight,'' he wrote.         Ms. Hunter's 1944 marriage to William Baldwin ended in divorce in 1946. The couple had one child, Kathryn, now of Stamford, Conn., who took the name of Ms. Hunter's second husband, Robert Emmett. Emmett, also an actor, died in 2000. The couple had a son, Sean Robert, also of Stamford, and Ms. Hunter is survived by six grandchildren.         As for her other most celebrated role, Ms. Hunter said ''Planet of the Apes'' was a project she respected. ''I thought it was a damned interesting script and a challenge for all of us,'' she said.         She spent hours at the Bronx Zoo, she said, studying primate behavior. But the project turned out to be more of a challenge than she had anticipated, largely because of the cumbersome makeup. ''The only part of me uncovered was my eyeballs,'' she said. ''I had to breathe through my upper lip. It was wild.''         Ms. Hunter also appeared opposite Humphrey Bogart in the 1952 drama ''Deadline USA,'' and drew critical praise in ''Lilith'' (1964) and ''The Swimmer'' (1968), among other roles. More recently, she had a small role in ''Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil'' (1997).         ''Acting is my life,'' she said in 1994. ''It doesn't get easier. It gets harder. I find it more challenging as I do it and realize how much more has to go into it. But I thank God I am in a profession where there is no retirement age.''       
         Bernice Chesler, the author of widely read guidebooks about American bed-and-breakfast inns, died on Sept. 4 at her home in Newton, Mass. She was 69.         The cause was cancer, said a friend, Lynda Morgenroth.         Mrs. Chesler's work won praise around the country. Her four bed-and-breakfast guidebooks were republished in at least a dozen revised editions.         The books ''created the template for inn guidebooks nationwide,'' The Richmond Times-Dispatch said in 1999, adding, ''In addition to giving the facts about an inn's address and rates,'' she sought to portray ''the personality of the hosts and their house.''         Her books were ''Bernice Chesler's Bed & Breakfast in New England'' (1998, Chronicle), ''Bernice Chesler's Bed & Breakfast in the Mid-Atlantic States'' (1997), ''Bed & Breakfast in the Northeast'' (1983) and ''Bed & Breakfast Coast to Coast'' (1986).         She was born Bernice Goldberg in Fall River, Mass., and held a bachelor's degree from Northeastern University. Surviving are her husband, David Alan Chesler; two sons, Stanford, of Newton, Mass. and Mark, of Oberlin, Ohio; a daughter, Lisa Winsor of Mattapoisett, Mass.; and a grandchild.       
         Capt. Kathleen McGrath, the first woman to command a United States Navy warship, died on Thursday at the National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. She was 50 and lived in McLean, Va.         The cause was lung cancer, said her sister, Peggy McGrath.         Captain McGrath became commander of the frigate Jarrett, a 453-foot warship, with a 262-member crew, in the spring of 2000.         She took the helm six years after Congress lifted rules that prohibited women from serving on combat aircraft and warships.         Captain McGrath guided the ship to the northern reaches of the Persian Gulf, where the crew hunted boats suspected of smuggling Iraqi oil in violation of United Nations sanctions.         A 1975 graduate of California State University at Sacramento, she worked for the United States Forestry Service until 1980, when she decided to follow in her father's footsteps and join the Air Force.         But the recruiter was out to lunch, and she was won over by a Navy recruiter who promised her overseas travel.         Captain McGrath had deployments in the Western Pacific, Persian Gulf and the Mediterranean and Caribbean Seas.         In 1990, she participated in the operation intended to protect Saudi Arabia after Iraq invaded Kuwait.         She also commanded the rescue and salvage ship Recovery in 1993 and 1994.         ''Kathy was an accomplished surface warrior and leader,'' said Rear Adm. Harry Ulrich, director of surface warfare.         After her tour as commander of the Jarrett, Captain McGrath served at the Joint Advanced Warfighting Unit in Alexandria, Va.         During her career, Captain McGrath was honored with many medals, including the Legion of Merit and four Meritorious Service Medals.         In addition to her sister Peggy, she is survived by two other sisters; two brothers; her husband, Lt. Cmdr. Gregory Brandon, who is retired; their children, Nicholas and Clare; and her parents, James and Martha McGrath of Sequim, Wash.       
         Aileen Riggin Soule, a diver and swimmer who at age 14 became the youngest American Olympic gold medalist and later became the oldest living American female gold medalist, died Thursday in a nursing home in Honolulu. She was 96.         At the 1920 Olympics in Antwerp, Belgium, Riggin won the first gold medal awarded in women's springboard diving and became, at 4 feet 7 inches and 65 pounds, the smallest American Olympic champion. In the 1924 Olympic Games in Paris, she became the only woman to win medals in swimming and diving in the same Olympics, taking the silver medal in springboard diving and the bronze medal in the 100-meter backstroke.         In 1974, in one of the many articles she wrote on her career, she said:         ''My most unforgettable experience would have to be as the youngest member of the first American women's Olympic swimming and diving team in 1920. I was a very small 14-year-old. Until two months before the tryouts, we had no idea of the dives required, and some were entirely new. Lacking precedent, we learned as we went along, yet practice was uncertain as the boards were not standardized.         ''When the book of rules arrived, it was in French and sent us to the dictionary to discover what a 'coup de pied √† la lune' was. It turned out to be a gainer [a dive now known as a reverse]. There were also 12 dives instead of the usual 10, two of which to be drawn from a hat just before the contest.''         Last-minute preparation was the story of her career. She was born May 2, 1906, in Newport, R.I., and reared in New York City. Her father was a Navy paymaster, and she traveled extensively with her parents.         She learned to swim at age 6, in Manila Bay. In 1918, she came down with influenza during the epidemic that swept the United States during World War I. On her doctor's recommendation that she swim for her health, she joined the celebrated Women's Swimming Association team in New York.         In 1919, when she took up diving, there were no indoor pools with diving boards available to women. Many people thought women should not dive at all because it would injure their health.         The only place to practice in the metropolitan New York area was a tidal pool on Long Island, an hour from the city. When the tide rose, the board was about 10 feet above the surface, about the height of a 3-meter springboard. When the tide was out, the drop was 14 feet, so the divers tried to time their practices for high tide in warm weather on weekends.         Even with those poor training conditions, Riggin finished second in the United States Olympic trials behind Helen Wainwright, who was also 14. But until the day before the boat sailed for Antwerp, they were not sure they would be able to compete in the Olympics because many officials did not want women, much less two 14-year-olds. But because Riggin and Wainwright had also made the Olympic team as swimmers, they went.         For 13 days, they sailed on a battered military transport ship, where training was a nightmare. Riggin recalled: ''I remember the javelin throwers could tie a rope around their javelin, throw them out to sea and pull them back. The shooters used clay pigeons until they ran out. After a while, the sea gulls were looking pretty good.''         In a tiny canvas tank filled with seawater, the swimmers, one at a time, swam 5 to 10 minutes, held in place by a belt around the waist. Divers could not train at all.''         In Antwerp, a city still recovering from World War I, the swimmers and divers competed in a moat-like canal. Ethelda Bleibtrey, the American who won gold medals in all three women's races, told King Albert I of Belgium, ''I swam in mud, not water.''         The diving board was a plank with no spring, and, Riggin said, ''the water was black and icy cold.'' Without a coach there, the American women swept the medals, with Wainwright winning the silver and Thelma Payne the bronze. After that, American women won every gold medal in Olympic springboard diving until 1960.         In 1924, Riggin was an Olympian again, joining American teammates like Johnny Weissmuller, who later gained fame playing Tarzan, and a Yale rower named Benjamin Spock.         ''Being 18 and being in Paris was wonderful,'' she said. ''The sun was shining, we read Hemingway and we were just carried away.''         She was in the first underwater swimming film in 1922 and the first slow-motion swimming and diving films in 1923. She turned professional in 1925, giving diving exhibitions and swimming demonstrations in England and Wales.         In 1926, she played three weeks at the Hippodrome in New York, diving into a glass tank, into six feet of water. After her former swimming teammate Gertrude Ederle became the first woman to swim the English Channel, Riggin and Ederle toured for six months. In 1937, at the Cleveland Exposition, Riggin helped organize and star in the first Billy Rose Aquacade.         She toured the world, appeared in movies and wrote a sports column for The New York Evening Post and articles for national magazines. In 1967, she was inducted into the International Swimming Hall of Fame. She never stopped swimming or lecturing or writing about it, and at 85 she broke six world records for her age group in the world masters championships.         She and her husband, Howard Soule, who died several years ago, moved to Hawaii in 1957 and lived in a Diamond Head apartment in Honolulu. Even into her 90's, she swam three miles a week in the ocean.         She is survived by a daughter, Yvonne May of Zurich; a stepdaughter, Patti Anderson of Honolulu; and two stepsons, Bruce Soule of Newport Beach, Calif., and Wallace Soule of Bakersfield, Calif.         In 1996, when asked if she had any goals in addition to attending the Atlanta Olympics, she replied: ''Yes. I'd like to continue -- life in general, that is.''       
         Mary Maxine Reed, who in 1971 won a landmark Supreme Court case that struck down dozens of state laws discriminating against women, died on Sept. 26 near Boise, Idaho.         She was believed to be about 93, though she would not tell her age, her lawyer Allen Derr said.         On Nov. 22, 1971, the Supreme Court unanimously ruled that an Idaho law that automatically gave Mrs. Reed's former husband preference over her as administrator of their dead son's estate violated the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection under the law.         The Supreme Court called the Idaho law ''the very kind of arbitrary legislative choice forbidden by the Equal Protection Clause.''         It was the first time the Supreme Court had declared a state law unconstitutional because it discriminated against one sex.         The ruling overturned many similar laws around the country, including another Idaho law declaring the husband the head of the family, with the right to determine where it lives, as well as a 1948 Michigan law prohibiting women from serving alcoholic drinks in bars. Previous challenges to such laws before the Supreme Court had failed.         The case came about in 1967 after the Reeds' 16-year-old son, Richard Lynn Reed, shot himself. Mrs. Reed and her former husband, Cecil, from whom she was divorced in 1958, applied to a court to administer their son's small estate, which consisted chiefly of a clarinet, phonograph records, clothes and $495 in a savings account.         Mrs. Reed lost the first court battle because Idaho law said that when two people were equally qualified to be administrators, preference must be given to a man.         Saying she was angry that ''women could be stepped on like that,'' Mrs. Reed then appealed to the District Court and won.         But the Idaho Supreme Court reversed that decision on appeal. Mrs. Reed took her case to the Supreme Court.         Mary Maxine Reed, known as Sally, was probably born in Nebraska around 1909. Orphaned early, she was adopted by George and Nettie Kelso, who moved to Cambridge, Idaho, where they farmed. She graduated from Cambridge High School in 1929 under the name Mary Kelso.         In 1931 she married Cecil R. Reed in Ontario, Ore. They eventually moved to Boise, where her husband worked for the Idaho Highways Department. They adopted Richard Lynn, their only child.         After their divorce, Mrs. Reed earned her living by ironing, baking, baby-sitting and looking after disabled people in her Boise home. She retired in 1998.         In a widely reported legal battle that contrasted with the rest of her quiet life, Mrs. Reed was assisted by Mr. Derr, her Boise lawyer, and two lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union, Mel Wulf and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who is now a Supreme Court Justice.         In a letter to Mr. Derr read at Mrs. Reed's funeral on Oct. 5, Justice Ginsburg said, ''Sally Reed lived to see the good that came from her brave decision to challenge an unjust law.''       
         Dr. Jeanne L. Noble, a professor of education who in 1962 became one of the first African-American women to receive tenure at New York University, died on Oct. 17 at New York University Medical Center. She was 76.         She had congestive heart failure, a friend, Paula Giddings, said.         Dr. Noble, who received her undergraduate degree from Howard University and a doctorate in education from Columbia University, joined the N.Y.U. faculty in 1959.         At the time of her death, she was professor emeritus at the City University of New York's Graduate Center and at Brooklyn College.         In 1963, she joined efforts to desegregate her hometown, Albany, Ga., as national president of the Delta Sigma Theta sorority.         In 1964, she was chosen by President Johnson to help plan the Women's Job Corps, a component of his national plan to fight poverty.         Later, she was appointed by Presidents Nixon and Ford to serve on national educational commissions.         Dr. Noble wrote ''The Negro Woman as College Graduate,'' published in 1956, and a history of African-American women, ''Beautiful, Also, Are the Souls of My Black Sisters,'' published in 1978.         In 1970, she won a regional Emmy Award for writing and moderating the CBS television program ''The Learning Experience.''         Jeanne Laveta Noble was born on July 18, 1926. She is survived by two brothers, John, of St. Louis, and William, of Albany, Ga.       
         Kim Gallagher, a slim but strong runner who overcame endless illnesses to win a silver medal in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics and a bronze in the 1988 Seoul Olympics, died Monday in a Philadelphia hospital. She was 38 and lived in Oreland, Pa.         The cause of death was a stroke, her husband, John Corcoran, said. She learned she had colon cancer after the 1988 Olympics and stomach cancer in 1995. In remission from colon cancer, she resumed running and last competed in the 1992 United States Olympic trials.         Both Olympic medals came at 800 meters, and Gallagher was the only American woman or man to win an individual track medal in Seoul at a distance longer than 400 meters. Her 1988 Olympic time of 1 minute 56.91 seconds still ranks as the third fastest by an American woman at 800 meters, behind Jearl Miles-Clark (1:56.40) and Mary Decker Slaney (1:56.90).         Her athletic success was remarkable considering her health. Six months before the 1984 Olympics, she had surgery for multiple cysts on her ovaries caused by an estrogen imbalance. The condition reappeared until it was finally relieved by hormone treatment.         Years later, when colon cancer was diagnosed, Gallagher rejected her doctor's recommendation of surgery and chemotherapy, treating it with vitamins, diet and rest. The cancer went into remission, then reappeared in 1994.         A year later, she said: ''I'm fine, I'm healthy, I'm strong. But I really can't work a full day. I get tired.''         In 1996, she used a wheelchair, but she refused to see doctors and improved enough to walk with a cane.         Kimberly Ann Gallagher was born June 11, 1964, in Fort Washington, Pa., near Philadelphia. Her track career started at age 7 when she followed her 9-year-old brother, Bart, to his track club.         ''He told me I couldn't join the club and not to hang around him,'' she once said. ''I remember I was wearing clogs, and I knew that I was ready to do track, whatever that was.         ''When I won my first trophy and it was as big as me, I knew I wanted to someday make the Olympic team.''         At 8, she ran a 5:37 mile, the fastest by a girl that age. At 16, she finished eighth in the 800 meters in the Olympic trials.         Gallagher attended the University of Arizona for a semester and a half, training with the men's cross-country team. She left college, she said, because ''world-class training and competing for a college don't go hand in hand.''         Until college, she had been coached by her brother, Bart, who died in 2000. When she left college, he looked for an experienced coach for her and chose Chuck DeBus in California. DeBus coached her from 1983 to 1988, but he said her health prevented her from completing half her workouts. ''Who knows how fast she could have run if she could have trained like a normal person?'' he told The Los Angeles Times.         DeBus was later barred for two years by The Athletics Congress, then the sport's national governing body, for supplying anabolic steroids to his athletes.         After Gallagher started training with DeBus, her 5-foot-5 body became muscular, although her weight seldom exceeded 108 pounds. She said she never took steroids.         ''I never wanted to look like all those pumped-up, big-looking, talking-weird women,'' she said. ''I liked my looks too much.''         Gallagher insisted she never loved the sport. She liked what it brought, especially a Mercedes-Benz and a Malibu home after her 1984 Olympic success.         She is survived by her husband; her 13-year-old daughter, Jessica Smith; her mother, Barbara of Philadelphia; and her father, John of Benson, Ariz.         She summed up her career by saying: ''I needed to run for all the wrong reasons. I needed to run to keep my shoe contract. I needed to run to pay my bills. I learned a huge lesson. When I ran in the 1984 Olympics, I was going to be a star. I was going to make so much money, and I did.         ''But it doesn't last if you're not devoted to what you're doing. I was not devoted to my running, and it showed. I don't get a great joy from running or training or going out and doing all the work. Running is not something I love, but I like excelling at things that I am good at.''       
         Hadda Brooks, the smoky-voiced torch singer and pianist who was known in the 1940's as the Queen of the Boogie and came out of retirement in the late 1980's to gain new popularity with younger audiences, died on Thursday at 86.         She died at White Memorial Hospital in Los Angeles, a few weeks after undergoing open-heart surgery, said Russ Paul, her manager.         Trained as a classical pianist, Ms. Brooks began recording boogie-woogie instrumentals in 1945 for Modern Records, which soon became the West Coast's premier rhythm-and-blues label. In the late 1940's and 50's she scored a number or hits as a torch singer, including ''That's My Desire,'' ''Trust in Me'' and ''Dream.''         She played singers in several films, and won a role singing to Humphrey Bogart in the film ''Out of the Blue'' after beating Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan in auditions. She toured with the Harlem Globetrotters, and in 1951 became the first black woman in the country to host her own television variety show.         Born Hadda Hapgood in Los Angeles in 1916, she begged her father for piano lessons at the age of 4, and stretched her tiny hands on a board for a week until they could reach across an octave.         She started out playing at rehearsals for a tap dance coach, Willie Covan, with clients like Fred Astaire, Eleanor Powell, Gene Kelly and Shirley Temple. Mr. Covan was friendly with the Globetrotters' players and in 1941 Ms. Brooks married another basketball player, Earl Morrison. He died a year later of pneumonia at 21.         Early on in her career, she became close friends with Billie Holiday, whom she met in a nightclub ladies' room when Ms. Holiday reportedly opened the door to her stall and offered Ms. Brooks a puff on her marijuana cigarette.         Ms. Brooks's big break came when a jukebox repairman named Jules Bihari overheard her playing a piano in a Los Angeles record store in the mid-1940's. He said he had only $800, but if she would work up a boogie in two weeks he would record it. She did, and the result, ''Swinging the Boogie,'' became her first hit, in 1945.         In the 1950's, she drifted into obscurity, singing and playing in Europe, Hawaii and Australia, and in 1971 she retired.         But in 1987 she sang at a supper club in Los Angeles and drew rave reviews. By the mid-1990's, she had been discovered by the younger generation, and was playing in the actor Johnny Depp's Viper Room in Los Angeles, along with quieter locales like the Oak Room of New York's Algonquin Hotel.         ''Her voice, velvety and drenched with an after-hours smokiness, is familiar with deep emotions,'' wrote the critic Peter Watrous in The New York Times in 1989.         In 1993, the Rhythm and Blues Foundation gave her its Prestigious Pioneer Award in a ceremony at the Hollywood Palace.         In 1995, she recorded a new CD titled ''Time Was When'' for Virgin/Pointblank Records, which has also issued a new 50-year retrospective of her work, ''I've Got News for You.''         Ms. Brooks is survived by a sister, Kathryn Carter, and two nephews, Kent and Darryl Carter.         ''I try not to put anything new into my songs,'' she told an interviewer in 1989. ''I go back 20 years to find me.''         Correction:  November 26, 2002, Tuesday  An obituary of the singer and pianist Hadda Brooks in some copies on Sunday misidentified the film in which she sang to Humphrey Bogart. It was ''In a Lonely Place,'' not ''Out of the Blue.''       
         Harriet Doerr, who at 73 published her first novel, unveiling an exquisite gift to marshal clear, sparse prose to evoke, in her phrase, memories ''like a gentle knife stuck into your heart,'' died on Sunday at her home in Pasadena, Calif. She was 92.         She had been in declining health since she suffered a broken hip in a fall last month, said her daughter, Martha Doerr Toppin. In recent years, glaucoma and frailty kept her from writing, even at her methodical pace of a sentence or so an hour.         Ms. Doerr's gleaming literary reputation rested on three slender books, perhaps 600 pages in all.         Her first book, ''Stones for Ibarra'' (Viking, 1984), which won the American Book Award for first fiction, was called ''a perfect book'' by the writer Alice Adams, and her next novel and a book of short stories elicited similar praise.         Her style roamed the geography of Mexico, memory and mood in a manner that the critic Anatole Broyard in The New York Times said carried ''echoes of Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, Katherine Anne Porter and even Graham Greene.'' Her gift for phrasing was suggested by her description of the Mexican village as ''no more than a shard chipped from the rock face of eternity.'' Elsewhere she called it ''a town of a hundred burros.''         Her critics generally agreed that she improved with age, and emphasized that her works would have been remarkable for a writer of any age.         In reviewing her second novel, ''Consider This, Se√±ora'' (Harcourt, 1993), published in 1993, when she was 83, the critic Margo Jefferson wrote in The Times, ''Everything is richer, as when an actress takes a role you saw her play a decade ago, and lets you read that decade in her face, her voice and her body.''         Harriet Green Huntington was born in Pasadena on April 8, 1910, the third of six children and two step-children. Her grandfather was Henry Edwards Huntington, and she played with her siblings at his San Marino estate, which is now the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens. She grew up with nannies and servants, as well as more intangible blessings: her family loved reading and lively discussions, her daughter said.         Ms. Doerr was asked to read several of her poems at high school graduation, but would not allow the school to reproduce them because she thought they were awful. When she was 16, she met Albert Doerr, an engineering student at Stanford University who took her to a prize fight on their first date. She was horrified, not least because of the droplets of blood that had spattered on her dress.         She went east to Smith College in 1927 with her train compartment filled with roses from Mr. Doerr. She did not like the cold of Massachusetts and felt homesick and ''half in love.'' By the summer of 1928, she left Smith and transferred to Stanford. where Mr. Doerr was finishing his degree. They married in 1930, and she left college.         They had two children; the first, a son, Michael, died of cancer in 1995. Ms. Toppin, the second child and Ms. Doerr's only survivor, lives in Oakland.         In World War II, while her husband served in the Navy, she and he signed petitions protesting the relocation of Japanese-Americans to internment camps.         The family went to Mexico in the late 1950's. There Mr. Doerr oversaw the revival of his family's mining business. Much of the emotional quality of that experience is contained in Ms. Doerr's first novel, including the male protagonist's struggle with leukemia. Mr. Doerr died of leukemia in 1972.         Her son teased Ms. Doerr into returning to college in 1975. She first took some classes at Scripps College in Claremont, Calif., and then enrolled full time at Stanford, majoring in history. She was accepted into the university's prestigious creative-writing program. Other students resented her presence, until she read her first piece aloud.         Ms. Doerr won the $2,500 Transatlantic Review-Henfield Foundation Award in 1982, based on three stories she had published in small literary magazines. Senior editors at Viking Penguin suggested her stories could be combined into a novel. She and a professor shuffled them on her living room floor until a larger narrative fell into place.         Her next novel, ''Consider This, Se√±ora,'' was also set in Mexico and was seen by some critics as imitative. But Laura Cumming, writing in The Guardian of London, said it was ''full of enchanted fables.''         ''The Tiger in the Grass'' (Viking, 1995) was a collection of essays, many about Mexico. But words of searing pain reflected a more immediate concern: her son was then dying of cancer, and Ms. Doerr used italicized passages to tell his story. In one, she remembered that his first word was ''car'' and that the doctor had just forbidden him to drive.         ''Now his car is parked outside his house and is visible from several windows,'' she wrote. ''I have forgotten the details of Chinese water torture we used to hear of, but it must be something like this.''         Ms. Doerr believed in no religion, but often took solace in each person's ability to create memories that live on. In ''Consider This, Se√±ora,'' the character Ursula Bowles, a widow who enters the story at age 79 and exits at 83, witnesses life's evanescence.         ''She could see that an individual life is, in the end, nothing more than a stirring of air, a shifting of light,'' Ms. Doerr wrote. ''No one of us, finally, can be more than that. Even Einstein. Even Brahms.         ''Then the widow slept.''       
         Vinnette Carroll, the trailblazing actress, director and playwright who was the first African-American woman to direct a production on Broadway, died Tuesday at her home in Fort Lauderhill, Fla. She was 80.         The cause was complications from diabetes and heart disease, said Anita MacShane, a friend.         A black woman in a business often dominated by white men, Ms. Carroll's career included several theatrical milestones and a consistent sense of activity and ambition.         As a director, she was not only the first black woman to direct on Broadway -- the musical revue ''Don't Bother Me I Can't Cope,'' in 1972 -- but she also brought her best-known show, the gospel-infused ''Your Arms Too Short to Box With God,'' to Broadway on three separate occasions. As an actress, Ms. Carroll won an Emmy (''Beyond the Blues,'' in 1964), an Obie (''Moon on a Rainbow Shawl,'' in 1962) and was nominated for three Tony awards.         Ms. Carroll was also the founder and artistic director of the Urban Arts Corps, a New York-based training and producing organization devoted to supporting black and Hispanic theater and actors. The group fostered the careers of hundreds of performers, including Cicely Tyson and Sherman Hemsley, as well as presenting ''Don't Bother Me'' and ''Your Arms Too Short.'' The onetime director of the New York State Ghetto Arts Program, which brought theater and dance to poor neighborhoods, Ms. Carroll also worked in Los Angeles at the Inner City Repertory in the Watts district, presenting classical and modern works.         Born into a well-off Jamaican family, Ms. Carroll moved to Harlem when she was 10 and found an instant affinity for the arts, playing viola with the Dean Dixon Symphony when in high school. Her father, however, who was a dentist, had medical plans for her. After graduating from Long Island University, Ms. Carroll received a master's degree in psychology from New York University and worked briefly as a clinical psychologist in the New York City schools.         At the same time, though, she was moonlighting in acting classes; drama soon won her over. In 1948, she was accepted to the Erwin Pescator dramatic workshop at the New School, where she studied with Lee Strasberg and Stella Adler.         A tall woman with with round cheeks and a high brow, Ms. Carroll was not classified as beautiful in the traditional sense, but still she impressed her teachers with her expressive eyes and resonant voice.         After honing her craft by acting at the Harlem Y.M.C.A., Ms. Carroll found some work in the theater in the 1950's, and also toured extensively with a one-woman show that she wrote. Her Broadway debut came in a short-lived revival of ''A Small War on Murray Hill,'' open for a single week in January 1957.         It was during the 1960's and 70's, the height the national black theater movement, that Ms. Carroll's talents came into full bloom.         In 1962, she won her Obie in ''Moon Over a Rainbow Shawl'' Off Broadway, stealing scenes from her castmate James Earl Jones. A year later, ''Trumpets of the Lord,'' Ms. Carroll's musical adaptation of seven sermons, became a runaway Off Broadway hit. In 1964, she won her Emmy. In 1966, she garnered more praise for directing and starring in the Langston Hughes play ''Prodigal Son,'' a production that toured Europe.         In 1967, she founded the Urban Arts Corps, which produced dozens of shows out of a space on West 20th Street. In 1969, another production of ''Trumpets of the Lord'' opened on Broadway, but closed in less than a week.         Ms. Carroll more than made up for the brevity of that run with two enormous success during the 1970's. The first was ''Don't Bother Me, I Can't Cope,'' a roof-raising gospel revue with songs by Micki Grant, which Ms. Carroll conceived, produced and directed at the Urban Arts Corps in 1970 and later took to Broadway, where it ran for 1,065 performances. Ms. Carroll's direction was nominated for a Tony, making her the first black woman ever to win that nomination. (She lost to Bob Fosse for ''Pippin.'')         Shortly after ''I Can't Cope'' closed, in 1974, Ms. Carroll began conceiving a followup, a gospel celebration of the Gospel of St. Matthew. That show, ''Your Arms Too Short to Box With God,'' with music and lyrics by Alex Bradford and Micki Grant, turned out to be a big success, spawning several national tours and two return trips to Broadway, including a 1982 version starred Patti LaBelle and Al Green. A fourth trip to Broadway is being planned for next year.         Not all of Ms. Carroll's efforts were as successful. A pricey adaptation of ''Alice in Wonderland,'' titled ''But Never Jam Today,'' had a tortured route to Broadway, only to close within a week, in 1979.         Ms. Carroll divided her time between New York and Florida, where she bought a house in the 1980's. She is survived by a sister, Dorothy Carroll Hudgins, of Manhattan.         In the late 1980's, she founded a theater in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., devoted to featuring work by minority playwrights and actors. Throughout her life, Ms. Carroll was an eloquent speaker about the challenges of being black and female.         ''I have had a great deal of hurt in the theater both as a Negro and as a woman, but I don't get immobilized by it,'' she said an interview with The Los Angeles Times in 1967. ''I tell myself that no one individual is going to make it impossible for me.''       
         Maria Bjornson, a designer of sets and costumes for opera, theater and ballet, died at her home in London on Dec. 13. She was 53.         While acclaimed for her designs for ''Phantom of the Opera,'' for which she won two Tony Awards in 1988, she was mainly active in noncommercial theater. Her debut project for the Metropolitan Opera, the sets for Francesca Zambello's production of Berlioz's ''Troyens,'' will be seen for the first time on Feb. 10. The sets are nearly completed. ''Maria's thorough and careful work left us in very good shape,'' said Joseph Clark, a technical director at the Met.         Ms. Bjornson's work was colorful, opulent and historically informed, the antithesis of minimalist abstraction. Her range, too, was striking, crossing from Janacek's operas with David Pountney at the Welsh National Opera to ''Sleeping Beauty'' for the Royal Ballet to Andrew Lloyd Webber musicals.         Her involvement with ''Phantom'' began when the producer Cameron Mackintosh saw her work for the Royal Shakespeare Company's production of ''The Tempest,'' which starred Derek Jacobi. In the 17 years of ''Phantom's'' London run, Ms. Bjornson never missed a cast change..         Ms. Bjornson, a granddaughter of Bjornstjerne Bjornson, winner of the 1903 Nobel Prize in literature, was born in 1949. She grew up in modest circumstances in London, and studied at the Central School of Art and Design. She began her designing career at the Glasgow Citizens Theater.         Her first collaboration with Ms. Zambello, Mozart's ''Don Giovanni,'' opened last February at the Royal Opera House, and they were working on two other projects beside ''Les Troyens'': ''The Little Prince'' (which will open at the Houston Grand Opera in June), and Verdi's ''Trovatore'' for the Op√©ra Bastille in Paris.         Ms. Bjornson is survived by her mother, Mia Prodan of London.       
         Dolly Dawn, a big-band vocalist whose honey-sweet voice each noon, six days a week, bounced invitingly across America in the late 1930's and early 40's, died last Wednesday at a nursing home in Englewood, N.J. She was 86.         Her death was announced this week by her family.         She was one of the first vocalists to become the sole focus of a band, at a time when bands and musicians were still the main draw. Ella Fitzgerald called Miss Dawn an influence on her own singing. Joe Franklin, the New York radio and television personality, said in an interview that when Walter Winchell coined the term ''canary'' for female singers, he was referring to her.         She sang first with George Hall and His Orchestra, and then with a group carved out of the band called ''Dolly Dawn and Her Dawn Patrol.'' Later, she played clubs, dance halls and street fairs, among other engagements, all over the United States.         But Miss Dawn dropped out of the limelight and became known mainly to the cult following that saw her in scattered club appearances in the 1970's and 80's, and responded to the release of a two-disk album of her records with George Hall on the RCA Bluebird label in 1976.         There was another revival of interest in her after Sony's reissue of some of her hits, most recently a collection called ''You're a Sweetheart'' in 2001. Paper dolls of her are sold on eBay.         She received almost no royalties for her reissued recordings, obtained only minimal Social Security and suffered in recent years from diabetes and kidney failure, Peter Sando, her nephew, said. She had lived in a transient hotel in Manhattan before being given an apartment and other assistance by the Actors' Fund, also in Manhattan. She moved to the Actors' Fund Nursing Home and Assisted Living Care Facility in Englewood earlier this year.         Theresa Maria Stabile was born on Feb. 3, 1916, in Newark and grew up in Montclair, N.J. Both her parents were Italian immigrants and her father ran a restaurant, among other jobs. Her cousin was the bandleader Dick Stabile. At 14, she won an amateur contest that Hall held in Newark. He shook her hand, but had forgotten her a year or two later when she showed up at the Taft Hotel in Manhattan, where his band regularly played. With the regular female vocalist about to leave, Ms. Dawn auditioned and got the job. She was known at the time as Billie Starr. Mr. Hall and Harriet Mencken, a writer on The New York Journal-American, came up with Dolly Dawn.         ''She's as fresh as the dawn and as dimpled as a doll,'' the newspaperwoman said, according to an article in Radio Guide in 1937. Miss Dawn never stopped hating the name, which she thought made her sound like a stripper.         After six months of musical training, she began singing with Hall's band in July 1935, which every day but Sunday was broadcast nationally on CBS radio from the Taft Hotel at noon. The show's tagline: ''Dance With Romance.'' Her relationship with Hall and his wife was so close that they formally adopted her when she was 19. In a ceremony on July 4, 1941, he turned his band over to her and became her manager.         She returned the loyalty. Tommy Dorsey asked her to sing with his band, but she turned him down, said Ronald Knoth, a social worker who helped her during her later years.         A popular part of the band's performance had become her appearing with just seven musicians in a group she named Dawn Patrol, after a newspaper column Ed Sullivan wrote called ''Along the Dawn Patrol.'' Sullivan, a friend, gave her permission.         Ms. Dawn never married, saying that her music was her husband and children. She is survived by her sister, Ida Sando, of Spring Lake, N.J.       
         Lucy Grealy, the poet and essayist who wrote a noted 1994 memoir, ''Autobiography of a Face,'' about her experience growing up with extreme facial disfigurement and repeated surgery to repair it, died at a friend's house in Manhattan on Wednesday night. She was 39.         No cause of death was announced. Friends said she had been despondent over operations she underwent two years ago.         Reviews of her memoir stressed that it was not simply a medical history or a cry of anguish but a distinguished contribution to the literature of the self.         In The New York Times, Margo Jefferson wrote: ''So many memoirs make you feel that you've been sealed up inside a wall with a monomaniac. A really good one, like 'Autobiography of a Face,' makes you feel there is more to ask and learn. You are not just seeing the writer; you are not trying to see yourself. You are seeing the world in a different way.''         In the book, Ms. Grealy described how she underwent surgery at 9 for what seemed to be a dental cyst, but which led to a diagnosis of Ewing's sarcoma, a rare and virulent cancer. After several more operations, half her jaw was gone, and only flesh remained on the lower right side of her face. But with radiation and chemotherapy, she survived.         Over the next 18 years she underwent about 30 more operations to rebuild her face. Older boys at her school would yell, ''That is the ugliest girl I have ever seen.'' She herself concluded, ''I was too ugly to go to school.''         But she was also proud and determined, Ms. Grealy wrote.         Lucinda Margaret Grealy, whose last name is pronounced GRAY-lee, was born in Dublin to Desmond and Trena Anne Grealy. She and her twin sister, Sarah Louise, were the youngest of five children, who included her older brothers, Sean and Nicholas, and another sister, Suellen. Her family immigrated to the United States in 1967 when she was 4.         In addition to her twin, Sarah Louise Barasch, she is survived by her mother and two siblings who live in London, her brother Nicholas and her sister Suellen Grealy Vlaveanos.         After settling the family in Spring Valley, N.Y., her parents saw themselves as fallen aristocrats. They had been well-known journalists in Ireland -- her father had helped found RTE, Ireland's national broadcasting organization -- and then they felt stuck in the suburbs. Mr. Grealy commuted to work as a producer for ABC and CBS in New York, while Mrs. Grealy stayed home, rearing the children.         Ms. Grealy felt at first that by suffering heroically, ''I could save the entire family.'' But as her endless and crushingly expensive ordeal continued, she realized that her face, more than her own and her family's fortune, was her very self-image and life.         ''When my face gets fixed, then I'll start living,'' she said she told herself.         She graduated in 1981 from Spring Valley High School, earned a B.A. in 1985 at Sarah Lawrence College, where her interest in reading and writing poetry deepened, and in 1987 went to the Writers Workshop at the University of Iowa. She spent 1991-92 on a Bunting Fellowship at the Radcliffe Institute for Independent Study, where she completed her memoir.         As a result of publishing her book, Ms. Grealy saw her life in a different way. She felt she had gotten her message out, that she had found herself, that her face had become acceptable, Ms. Barasch, her twin, said. The book, which sold well, was published internationally and widely adopted in high school and college curriculums. In 1995 it won Ms. Grealy a Whiting Award, given to provide financial support to young writers of exceptional talent.         Ms. Grealy taught at Bennington College and New School University and published poetry in various magazines. In 2000 she published a second book, ''As Seen on TV,'' a collection of essays about her family and her experiences.
