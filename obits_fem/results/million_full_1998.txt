         Sister Bernadette Szymczak, who fought hunger and despair with such loving zeal that she turned a tiny Brooklyn food program into a mighty engine of sustenance and hope, died Monday at Long Island College Hospital. She was 76 and, until six months ago, had been getting up at 5 A.M. to stir the soup and poor people's spirits as the hands-on founding director of St. John's Bread and Life Soup Kitchen.         Friends said the cause was stomach cancer.         On paper, the soup kitchen Sister Bernadette founded in 1982 at the old red-brick campus of St. John's University on Lewis Avenue in Bedford-Stuyvesant would seem impressive enough. The 1,000 or so hot meals it serves each weekday in the old priests' dining hall make it the largest of the 1,000 emergency food kitchens and pantries that distribute about 60 million meals a year to New York City's poor.         And its array of medical, job placement, adult education and other satellite programs have won it a reputation as a model of its kind.         But to those who knew Sister Bernadette and fell under her spell, the numbers hardly measure her impact on the lives of those most food agencies regard as clients and Sister Bernadette knew only as guests.         ''She turned my life around,'' said Bill Baker, a one-time drug addict and petty criminal, recalling yesterday that his road to personal salvation began one freezing January day a few years ago when he stopped by St. John's for a warming cup of coffee and was approached by Sister Bernadette.         Speaking with a distinct Boston accent, she posed the question that would change his life: ''Would you mind helping with the trays?''         Like countless other street toughs before and after him, Mr. Baker, who had just got out of jail, found himself on his feet taking the first steps with a load of trays that would lead him  into Sister Bernadette's world of service before self.         ''The next day I came in a little earlier,'' he said, recalling the beginning of a slow, often-painful process that would, under Sister Bernadette's gentle goading, lead him to become a full-time volunteer, to abandon drugs and, finally, to join the kitchen's small staff.         ''She never gave up on me,'' he said.         A loving tenacity seemed to be the hallmark of a woman whose guests, not always the most stable of sorts, would sometimes become so disruptive she would throw them out, then welcome them back the next day.         To most of the guests, however, she was a warm and cordial woman who knew the regulars by name, inquired after their children and set such an inspiring standard of scurrying service that it is hardly surprising that the kitchen's two-dozen scurrying volunteers are all former guests.         To the volunteers she was also cordial, unless they became too boisterous, in which case they would see the stern side of a woman who brooked no nonsense when it came to helping those in need.         A native of Boston who was orphaned as a child, Bernadette Szymczak (pronounced SIM-zak) lived for a while in a home operated by the Daughters of Charity of St. Vincent DePaul, the order she later joined. By the time she got to Brooklyn in 1971, she had spent 25 years working with children in homes in Boston, Buffalo and Philadelphia.         For a few years after she and other members of the order established themselves in Brooklyn, at the request of the Vincentian priests who run St. John's parish, there seemed little need for a soup kitchen.         The once prosperous neighborhood had descended into poverty, but Food Stamps and other Great Society programs had all but eliminated hunger in Bedford-Stuyvesant and elsewhere, so much so that by 1980 only about 50 small soup kitchens were being operated in New York City.         Then came the Reagan Administration cutbacks of 1981, and as the need for food began to soar, Sister Bernadette, who had already established a thrift shop and an adult education program, started the soup kitchen, initially serving 15 or so meals a day.         Over the next decade and a half, as the slender woman in the plain blue habit grew frail in her work, she became a neighborhood heroine. As she walked along some of the city's meanest streets, layabouts would rise from their stoops, the faces of hardened young criminals would soften and she would be besieged with offers of assistance.         For all her charity, Sister Bernadette, whose idea of a hobby was to do a bit of sewing, then give her handiwork away, was not completely above a taste for luxury.         Friends who knew her weakness would take her out for a breakfast of pancakes or bring her a treat from McDonald's.         She leaves no immediate survivors.       
         Dorothy Hart Hirshon, a glamorous figure in New York society from the 1920's through the 40's who later became active in social, human rights and political causes, died Thursday in an automobile accident while driving near her home in Glen Cove, on Long Island. She was 89.         Frequently photographed and written about during her glittering earlier marriages to John Randolph Hearst and William S. Paley, she married Walter Hirshon, a stockbroker, in 1953. After their divorce in 1961, she became increasingly involved in education and philanthropic endeavors.         Described as ''one of the most beautiful girls in Southern California'' by Irene Selznick, Dorothy Hart was 19 when she met her first husband, Mr. Hearst, the third of William Randolph Hearst's five sons, while sailing on a yacht off Santa Barbara.         Mr. Hearst had not yet entered his first year at Oglethorpe University in Atlanta, but the couple were married in New York in December 1927.         The groom dropped out of college after his freshman year and joined the Hearst Corporation, and the young marrieds became regulars in the glamorous cafe society of the period, out on the town almost every night.         Mr. Hearst, who had difficulty working with his powerful father, began drinking heavily. Mrs. Hearst, hoping to set an example for her husband, who rarely showed up for work, took a job writing a column for Harper's Bazaar.         Mrs. Hearst met Mr. Paley, the dashing head of the Columbia Broadcasting System, in 1931. According to friends, it was immediately obvious that he was determined to marry her.         After some months, she went to Nevada and filed for a divorce. Mr. Hearst followed her; the couple reconciled and returned to New York. Five months later, Mrs. Hearst again traveled to Las Vegas and was granted a divorce. In May 1932, she married Mr. Paley in Kingman, Ariz.         ''Although seven years his junior, Dorothy was more worldly than he,'' Sally Bedell Smith wrote in ''In All His Glory,'' her 1990 biography of Mr. Paley. ''She knew her way around in sophisticated circles; friendships with men like Randolph Churchill counted a great deal to the ambitious Paley. In New York, she joined the Algonquin set -- the playwrights, journalists and other intellectuals whose luncheon ripostes during the 1920's became a literary legend.''         Over the years, Mrs. Smith wrote, Mr. Paley's wife had an impact on him -- ''her political leanings, appetite for news, taste in art and sense of style. She supported Franklin D. Roosevelt and embraced his proposals for social welfare.''         David Patrick Columbia wrote in Quest magazine in 1993: ''They were the golden couple on the town. She became his Pygmalion. His hunger to know satisfied her trenchant desire to teach. He had the instincts, but she, despite her youth, had the instincts and the knowledge. She began transforming his life. She got him to Savile Row tailors. She encouraged him to buy art and introduced him to dealers. In a short time they began to accumulate what is now known as the William Paley Collection. At her suggestion, they pursued the thoroughly modern path of psychoanalysis.''         She was sketched by Matisse, photographed by Cecil Beaton and Horst, listed as one of the world's best-dressed women and featured in Vogue and Harper's Bazaar. She decorated Kiluna Farm, their 85-acre estate in Manhasset, with a saltwater pool and an indoor tennis court, lining the walls with their growing collection of Impressionist and Post-Impressionist paintings. Twenty-two servants looked after the house, gardens and greenhouse.         The Paleys separated in 1945, shortly after Mr. Paley returned from wartime service in London. Mrs. Smith observed in her book that Mr. Paley's ''peccadillos weren't the only symptom of trouble ahead.''         ''To those with a sharp eye, other hairline cracks were showing in the marriage,'' Mrs. Smith wrote. ''When Dorothy corrected him in public, she was brisk and impatient, not gentle.''         They were divorced in 1947, and she received some paintings, furniture, silver and $1.5 million.         ''I never behaved as if the world revolved around him,'' Mrs. Hirshon once recalled about her marriage to Mr. Paley. ''Maybe that was a problem.''         Dorothy Hart was born in Los Angeles on Feb. 25, 1908, the only child of Seth Hart, an insurance broker, and the former Dorothy Jones. While she was in elementary school, the family moved to Dayton, Ohio, for three years. Upon their return to Los Angeles, she attended Marlboro, an exclusive girls' school. She later spent a year at Bennett Junior College in Millbrook, N.Y., and furthered her lifelong interest in art by taking several art history courses.         Although she participated in a number of social projects throughout her life, raising money to build a nursery school in Harlem, for instance, and serving as a guidance counselor at the Downtown Community School in the 1940's, she became more involved in philanthropic and community activities in the last 40 years.         She worked with the Neighborhood Children's Center for more than two decades, was a member of the New York City Human Rights Commission, served on the Hospitality Committee of the United Nations in the 1960's, and became a board member of the Vivian Beaumont Theater, a board member of Lincoln Center in the 1980's and a trustee of Carnegie Hall. She was also on the board of Phoenix House and was a trustee of the New School for Social Research until her death.         She is survived by a son, Jeffrey Paley of Manhattan; a daughter, Hilary Paley Califano of Roxbury, Conn., and Manhattan; a stepdaughter, Joy H. Briggs of Manhattan, seven grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.       
         Mae Questel, a rubber-voiced veteran of stage, screen and vaudeville who played Woody Allen's mother in ''New York Stories'' and was the cartoon voice of Betty Boop and Olive Oyl, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.         Ms. Questel was 17 and living in the South Bronx when she won a local contest to find the girl who most resembled Helen Kane, a popular singer known as the boop-oop-a-doop queen. Ms. Questel was signed by an agent that night and soon was performing on the vaudeville circuit, including numerous stints at the Palace Theater.         She appeared in acts alongside many other performers and also as a ''single,'' using her flexible vocal cords to sing and do imitations of Maurice Chevalier, Fanny Brice, Rudy Vallee and Marlene Dietrich.         When the animator Max Fleischer heard Ms. Questel doing her boop-oop-a-doop routine in 1931, he signed her to take over the cartoon voice of Betty Boop in more than 150 animated shorts, until Fleischer retired the character in 1939. Her recording of ''On the Good Ship Lollipop,'' in Betty Boop's voice, sold more than two million copies in the 1930's.         In 1933, she created the voices of Olive Oyl and Sweet Pea for the ''Popeye'' cartoons, and played Popeye's scrawny paramour in more than 450 cartoons until they went out of production in 1967. She once told an interviewer that her Olive Oyl voice was an attempt to imitate the actress ZaSu Pitts. At various times, she also provided the voices for Little Audrey, Casper the Friendly Ghost and other cartoon characters.         Among her many Broadway credits were ''Dr. Social'' in 1948, ''A Majority of One'' in 1959 and ''Enter Laughing'' in 1963. She also appeared in the film version of ''A Majority of One'' in 1962, ''Funny Girl'' in 1968 and ''New York Stories'' in 1989. On the soundtrack of Mr. Allen's ''Zelig'' (1983) she sang the Betty Boop theme song, ''Chameleon Days.''         She is survived by a son, Richard Balkin of upstate New York, and three granddaughters.         In 1963 Ms. Questel was asked to give her philosophy for survival. ''Don't make a megillah out of every little thing,'' she said.         Correction:  January 16, 1998, Friday  A picture caption on Jan. 8 with an obituary of the actress who was the cartoon voice of Betty Boop and Olive Oyl misspelled her surname. She was Mae Questel, as the article  said, not Questal.       
         Helen Haje, a Washington public relations woman who championed Arab-American interests with such good-natured fervor that she became gadfly and godmother to the Arab-American movement in the United States, died on Monday at a hospital near her home in Washington. She was 74.         Her family said the cause was congestive heart failure.         The daughter of Lebanese immigrants, Mrs. Haje, who grew up in Altoona, Pa., and married a local Lebanese-American businessman, seemed content with her role as an  American housewife and mother.         But when her husband, Albert, died at the age of 33 in the early 1940's, leaving her with three young children, she pulled up stakes, moved to Washington and went to work, first as a secretary for Catholic Charities and later as an independent public relations woman.         Had it not been for the 1967 Arab-Israeli war and a resulting wave of  Arab stereotypes that swept the United States, Mrs. Haje might have remained a conventional public relations woman, representing commercial and other clients.         In a land of immigrants where ethnic and national societies abound, there had been virtually no Arab-American organizations in the United States, but in the wake of the 1967 war, many prominent Arab-Americans saw the need for a concerted effort both to counter the demonizing stereotypes and to lobby for policies favorable to their often-embattled homelands.         Through her long work with the Saints Peter and Paul Antiochian Orthodox Church in Bethesda, Md., Mrs. Haje had gotten to know and impress many of Washington's leading Arab-American figures, and in 1972 when a group of them formed the National Association of Arab-Americans as the first political Arab-American organization, Mrs. Haje suddenly found herself in the forefront of a movement.         Volunteering to become the group's first executive secretary, she operated the organization for its first few years, first from her home and later at a small office.         Although it was her typing skills that most benefited the organization in its formative stages, the association's founders, many of them unfamiliar with the ways of Washington, soon found her public relations expertise even more valuable.         Over the next years, Mrs. Hafe, a gregarious woman with a wide circle of friends and a bulging file of telephone numbers, continually amazed Arab-American leaders and visiting Arab diplomats with the ease with which she could put them in touch with journalists and newscasters, many of whom were, in turn, equally amazed with the ease with which she could ferret out and secure them interviews with obscure Arab officials or Arab-American scholars, lawyers and business leaders.         Mrs. Haje did not know every one of the estimated three million Arab-Americans in the United States. It just sometimes seemed she did. Although Lebanese-Americans, who account for a third of the total, are the most populous Arab group in the United States, Mrs. Haje recognized and celebrated the common bond among Americans from Syria, Palestine, Egypt, Iraq and other Arab counties.         Mrs. Haje, who also served as a bridge between Arab-American organizations, eventually worked so closely with so many of them, including the Arab-American Discrimination Committee and the Arab-American University Graduates Association, that Dr. Clovis Maksud, the Lebanese-born former head of the Arab League, called her the ''mother'' of most of the Arab-American organizations in the United States.         ''At a moment of great despair among Arab-Americans,'' Dr. Maksud said yesterday, ''she helped mobilize and organize the community.''         For all her devotion to her ancestral home in Lebanon and to other Arab countries, Mrs. Haje was a thoroughgoing American who emphasized the need for Arab-American leaders to criticize their homelands' governments when their actions warranted it.         Her survivors include two sons, Charles, of Destin, Fla., and Albert Jr., of Washington; a daughter, Sharyn Corry of Middleburg, Va.; two sisters, four brothers and two grandchildren.       
         Chessy Rayner, a decorator, fashion icon, editor and author of ''New York: Trends and Traditions,'' a recently published book about significant Manhattan interiors, died on Thursday night at Sloan-Kettering Medical Center in New York. She was 66.         Mica Ertegun, her partner in the design company MAC II, said that Mrs. Rayner died of lung cancer.         Rail-thin, exotically featured and crowned with a lion's mane of hair that gave her the look of a space-age Nefertiti, Chesbrough (Chessy) Lewis Hall was born in 1931 in Perrysburg, Ohio, into a privileged world where little was expected of a young woman except a fairy tale debut, a comfortable marriage and an entry in the Social Register.         The only child of Richard Hall and Chesbrough Lewis, a cafe society beauty famously photographed by Horst and Avedon, she dutifully followed her social destiny: finishing school, Briarcliff Junior College and candle-lighted wedding at St. Thomas Protestant Episcopal Church in Manhattan, in 1952, to William P. Rayner, a stockbroker who later became an executive at Conde Nast Publications.         The Rayners were celebrated in Vogue as ''a fast-paced, superattractive couple,'' and rare was the week when her haunting face and couture-clad frame did not appear in Women's Wear Daily.         Her star quotient increased exponentially in 1963, after her mother remarried, becoming the wife of Iva S. V. Patcevitch, the chairman of Conde Nast. For the rest of her life, she was one of the best-dressed and most-photographed fixtures of the Manhattan social scene.         But rather than idling indefinitely in the social spotlight, Mrs. Rayner  went to work for Ladies Home Journal, moved to Glamour, and then became a fashion editor at Vogue from 1956 to 1964.         By the mid-1960's, William Rayner said, ''The bubble was off the champagne.'' Bored with the business of fashion and chafing under her dictatorial boss, Diana Vreeland, Mrs. Rayner left Vogue and went in search of what William Rayner  called ''less ephemeral, more creative'' work. The couple were divorced in 1989.         She is survived by her mother, Chesbrough Patcevitch; a half-brother, Charles Minot Amory 3d, and a nephew, Charles Minot Amory 4th, all of Palm Beach, Fla.         She and Mica Ertegun, the wife of Ahmet Ertegun, the president of Atlantic Records, toyed with opening a restaurant. Though accomplished cooks -- Mrs. Rayner wrote three cookbooks -- friends decided that their individual talents, Mrs. Rayner's sense of color and Mrs. Ertegun's architectural eye, would offer more long-term opportunities.  MAC II -- the initials stood for Mica and Chessy -- was founded in 1967. For several years, its office was a large closet in the Erteguns' house on the Upper East Side.         Though House and Garden hailed the company for its ''consistently clean and crisp adaptations of shifting modes,'' initially, fellow designers looked upon the two young stylish women with disdain. Sister Parish, the white-gloved martinet of American decorating, dismissed them with chilling politesse: ''Chessy is a nice girl. And Mica does not have to work.'' Everybody else called them ''the girls.'' As Mrs. Rayner wryly told Vogue soon after MAC II opened, ''You can see how much dignity we command.''         Their first published project was a bedroom for the 9-year-old daughter of a friend, with tall bookcases made of bamboo poles and topped with burnt-orange felt valances. Soon, however, they became a force to be reckoned with, and by the early 1980's had amassed a portfolio of residential and commercial projects for boldface celebrities like the artist Kenneth Noland, the television producer Douglas Cramer and the fashion designer Bill Blass. Marian McEvoy, the editor of Elle Decor magazine, said that what distinguished their projects was ''pragmatic glamour.''         ''Chessy was a decorator, not a re-decorator,'' said Arnold Scaasi, the fashion designer. ''One of the reasons that I chose her was because she told me I could keep all of my old furniture.''         MAC II's spare, uncluttered rooms are known for luxurious but simple finishes, comfortable seating and art that is part of the space, not a dominant element. In one New York living room, moody paintings by Manet and Van Dongen seemed to be emerging from the surface of the gold lacquered walls as from the bottom of a pond.         But despite her professional eminence, Mrs. Rayner, who enjoyed discovering beauty in unlikely places and at underwhelming prices, did not shy from projects that her equally celebrated competition might consider beneath their dignity.         To furnish a landmark house designed by the architect Stanford White, she and Mrs. Ertegun cheerfully bought everything at Sears. For another project, it was all department-store furniture and Herculon fabrics.         In the pages of Elle Decor, where she was the special projects editor from 1992 until her death, Mrs. Rayner was forever exhorting readers to delight more in $2 water glasses than in $2 million chandeliers. Her home on St. Martin, the Caribbean island, will be featured in the May issue of Elle Decor.         ''Not everything has to be refined,'' she once said to a reporter who visited her country house in Southampton. ''That's too easy and too boring. I like amusing things, funny things, offbeat things. In fact, if anything, I wish my taste were even more offbeat.''       
         Jean Blackwell Hutson, who as curator and then chief of the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture helped make it the world's main public repository of materials on people of African descent, died on  Wednesday at Harlem Hospital. She was 83 and lived in Harlem.         From 1948, when the Schomburg Center was known as the Schomburg Collection, until 1980, when she retired as its chief, Mrs. Hutson harnessed her powerful will to assemble an archive of documents, books and works of art that reflected the experience not just of African-Americans, but of peoples throughout the African diaspora.         Under her supervision, the library grew to 75,000 volumes from 15,000 volumes. She assembled an important collection of historical material from Haiti, as well as of African art, and persuaded her childhood friend, Langston Hughes, to donate a portion of his papers to the center. A friend of Romare Bearden, Dorothy West, Richard Wright, W. E. B. DuBois and other figures of the Harlem Renaissance, Mrs. Hutson helped make the Schomburg the cultural center of Harlem.         Even when people, both black and white, during the integrationist movement of the 1940's and early 50's, questioned the need for a separate archive devoted entirely to black experience, Mrs. Hutson championed it. And in the years when the Schomburg's budget was faltering, she fought for financing, and lobbied the State Legislature for money.         ''She had an exacting personality,'' said Howard Dodson, the present chief of the Schomburg. ''She ran a tight ship and had an astute way of getting what she wanted done.  Once her mind was set on doing something, there was no stopping her.''         She was born in 1914 in Sommerfield, Fla., where her father, Paul O. Blackwell, was in business as a  farmer. Her mother, Sarah Myers  Blackwell, was an elementary school teacher. When she was 4, she and her mother moved to Baltimore while her father remained in Florida to run his business, commuting back and forth to Baltimore to visit his family.         Through her baby sitter, who ran a boarding house, she met the poet Langston Hughes. Hughes was then a student at Lincoln University in Oxford, Pa., and went to Baltimore on weekends. Their friendship endured. Throughout his life he referred to her as his ''baby sister,'' and when Mrs. Hutson came to Harlem as a young woman, Hughes made sure she met the leading writers and artists.         At 15, Mrs. Hutson was class valedictorian at her graduation from Douglass High School in Baltimore, then an all-black high school in a segregated system. The school had exacting standards and emphasized the study of black history and literature. One of her teachers was Yolande Du Bois, the daughter of W. E. B. DuBois.         She attended the University of Michigan, then switched to Barnard College. In 1935, she became the second black woman to graduate from Barnard; the first was Zora Neale Hurston.         Mrs. Hutson wanted to be a psychiatrist but took up library science with the goal of financing medical studies. In 1936 she received a master's degree from the Columbia University School of Library Service.         Her first job was in the New York City Public Branch Library system. As a librarian in the Bronx, Mrs. Hutson noticed that there were few Spanish-language books that would appeal to the borough's Spanish population, and she arranged to buy some. In 1939, she married Andy Razaf, a lyricist who wrote songs for Fats Waller. The marriage ended in divorce eight years later.         In 1950 she married John Hutson, a fellow employee at the Countee Cullen branch library. Mr. Hutson died in 1957. They had one daughter, Jean Frances, who died in 1992. Mrs. Hutson left no survivors.         In 1948, Mrs. Hutson was asked to take over the Schomburg, which was based on the private library of Arthur Alphonzo Schomburg, a Puerto Rican of African descent. ''I was drafted for six months to keep the Negroes quiet,'' Mrs. Hutson once said. ''People who grew up in the Depression didn't throw away jobs, so I came.''         With the rise of the black power movement and the success of independence movements in Africa and the Caribbean, interest in the Schomburg grew. In 1962, under her supervision, the library published the Dictionary Catalogue of the Schomburg Collection, which was put on microfilm and made its holdings known to libraries in Europe, Africa and the Americas.         Mrs. Hutson's work in developing the Schomburg caught the attention of President Kwame Nkrumah of Ghana, who asked her help in building an Africana collection at the University of Ghana. She lived in Ghana in 1964.         During the 1960's and 70's, the situation at the Schomburg grew perilous, with its collections deteriorating in the Countee Cullen branch library, a sparsely furnished, poorly lighted  space without air-conditioning at 103 West 135th Street. In 1971, Mrs. Hutson helped establish the Schomburg Corporation to raise money for a new building.         She ''learned to go to Albany,'' as she said once in an interview. There were many politicians, Mrs. Hutson said, ''who had never seen a black woman up in front of them at the legislature.'' Eventually she helped obtain a Federal grant for the construction of a new building.         In 1981, the new $3.7 million center finally opened, five stories tall, built of red brick and glass, climate-controlled, with an art gallery. By then, Mrs. Hutson had retired as the Schomburg's chief, and had taken a job in the office of library administration at the Public Library's headquarters on 42d Street.         Today, the Schomburg Collection holds some 150,000 volumes, 3.5 million manuscripts, the largest assemblage of photographs in the world documenting black life, and precious artifacts including a 16th-century manuscript, ''Ad Catholicum,'' by Juan Latino, believed to be the first book written by a black man.       
         Countess Anthony Szapary, the doyenne of Newport society and the great-great-granddaughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt who lived a good part of the year on the upper floors of  the Breakers, maintaining the family's presence in the 70-room mansion built by her grandparents, died on Sunday at Northern Westchester Hospital in Mount Kisco, N.Y. She was 79.         The Countess had suffered a stroke at her home in Pound Ridge, N.Y., her family said.         The former Sylvia Anita Gabriel Denise Irene Marie Szechenyi (pronounced sa-CHAIN-ee) was one of five daughters of Count Lazlo Szechenyi and Gladys Moore Vanderbilt Szechenyi. Her father was the first minister from Hungary to the United States and later served at the Court of St. James. Her mother was the daughter of Cornelius Vanderbilt 2d, who built the Breakers as the family's summer home.         The house, designed by Richard Morris Hunt and covering more than an acre of the 11-acre estate, was modeled after Renaissance palaces in Turin and Genoa, and was finished in 1895. The mansion, which, with furnishings costing $7 million, was one of the Gilded Age estates referred to by their owners at the time as cottages.         The Breakers was maintained as a private residence until 1947 when it was leased to the Preservation Society of Newport County for $1 a year. The maintenance and the taxes were paid by Countess Szechenyi until her death in 1965. The society bought the property in 1972, but Countess Szapary (pronounced sa-PAR-ee) continued to live in rooms on the third floor, and her devotion to the Breakers endured to the end of her life, officials of the society said yesterday. The original furnishings were not included in the sale of the property, but over the years Countess Szechenyi's descendants gave most of them to the society.         Countess Szapary, who was known as Syvie to her friends, was a lively woman with strong opinions, an impish sense of humor and an adventurous spirit. As a child, she used a large silver tray to toboggan down the impressive staircase at the Breakers, a tradition that younger members of the Vanderbilt family are said to have carried on. She also rode her bicycle at breakneck speed around the great hall, and during World War II, when the house was shuttered, she maintained, tongue in cheek, that she kept America safe through her volunteer work as a plane spotter on the roof of a boys school in Newport.         In her later years, after the Breakers was opened to tourists (who were always called guests, at her insistence), she would occasionally join the tour group, casually dressed, her identity unknown, and correct the guides if she believed they had made a mistake.         Born in Remete, in Austria-Hungary, on Oct. 9, 1918, the Countess attended the Potomac School in Washington, Miss Faunce's School in London and the Chateau Brilliantmont in Lausanne, Switzerland. In 1949, she married Count Anthony Szapary, a founder of the Hungarian National Sports Federation. Earlier, during World War II, he had been sent to a concentration camp for activities with the Hungarian Red Cross and his relief work for Polish and Jewish refugees. He was released through the intervention of King Gustav V of Sweden and came to the United States in 1947, becoming an adviser to the Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad. He died in 1972.         The Countess is survived by a son, Paul, and a daughter, Gladys Szapary, both of Manhattan, and a sister, Countess Ferdinandine Eltz of Salzburg, Austria.         Countess Szapary was a former president of the Rhode Island Arts Foundation at Newport and was actively involved in the Newport Preservation Society. She was an organizer of the Newport Coaching weekends and aided several charities. She enjoyed both giving and going to parties and, as an avid amateur photographer, almost always had a small camera slung around her neck at the many social occasions in which she took part. She was known among her friends for the small albums of photographs that she often sent to other celebrators.         Countess Szapary was chairwoman of the 1995 centennial celebration of the Breakers, for which she created, in the stables of the estate, ''New York Central With the Vanderbilts,'' a small-scale version of the New York Central Lines, founded by Cornelius Vanderbilt. The model was created using her own trains and has become a favorite display for the younger guests of the house.         Creating an image that has endured among preservationists as well as family members, the Countess appeared at the opening, immediately before the family ball was to begin, clad in a T-shirt with a New York Central logo, an engineer's cap and a bandaged foot.         ''She told me she had hurt it bungee jumping,'' said Alfred Vanderbilt Jr., a cousin.       
         Betsey Cushing Roosevelt Whitney, the widow of John Hay (Jock) Whitney, the first wife of James Roosevelt and the last of the three glamorous Cushing sisters of Boston, died yesterday at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y. She was 89.         Mrs. Whitney was one of the most prestigious figures in New York society, although she disliked publicity and rarely attended large social gatherings. When she did appear at an event, it was considered a coup.         In recent years, in failing health, Mrs. Whitney, a prominent philanthropist in medicine and art, spent most of her time at Greentree, one of the most magnificent private residences in the country, situated on 438 acres in Manhasset, on Long Island's Gold Coast. There, surrounded by an important Impressionist and Post-Impressionist art collection, gardens and greenhouses, Mrs. Whitney was looked after by 20 employees.         Mrs. Whitney was the second-born of the three Cushing sisters, who were renowned in the 1930's and 40's for their brilliant marriages into some of the most prominent families in the country. She inherited the bulk of one of the great American fortunes when Jock Whitney -- sportsman, financier, publisher of The New York Herald Tribune, philanthropist, political mover and shaker, and Ambassador to Britain -- died in 1982. In 1990, Forbes magazine estimated her wealth at $700 million.         Practicing the Art Of Marrying Well         From their debutante days, she and her sisters were celebrated by society chroniclers for their beauty and charm. Her older sister, Mary (Minnie) Cushing, was married to Vincent Astor, the wealthy real estate owner, and after a divorce, to James Whitney Fosburgh, an artist. She died in 1978 at 72. Barbara (Babe) Cushing, the youngest, was married to Stanley Mortimer Jr., a grandson of one of the founders of Standard Oil, and after a divorce, to William S. Paley, the legendary founder and chairman of the Columbia Broadcasting System.         Babe Paley, a perennial name on the world's best-dressed list and a glittering figure in society, also died in 1978, at 62, four months before her older sister.         Betsey Maria Cushing was born in Baltimore on May 18, 1908. Her father was Dr. Harvey Cushing, a neurosurgeon who was a professor of surgery at various times at Johns Hopkins, Harvard and Yale Universities. Her mother was Katherine Crowell Cushing, of a socially prominent family in Cleveland.         Dr. Cushing was a stern father, and Mrs. Whitney later recalled that ''perfectionism was drummed into us.'' The social skills that she learned at Miss May's, a private day school in Boston, and at the Westover School in Middlebury, Conn., were burnished by her mother, who made certain that her daughters excelled in the arts of entertaining and running a household as prerequisites for the advantageous marriages she was determined they would have.         David Grafton, the author of the 1992 book ''The Sisters: The Lives and Times of the Fabulous Cushing Sisters'' (Villard Books), wrote that Katherine Cushing once told a gossip columnist that she expected her girls ''to marry into the highest level of European nobility or into America's moneyed aristocracy.''         There were also two brothers, William and Henry, neither of whom survives.         Although marriage into the Roosevelt family did not apparently meet her highest expectations, it merited no objections. Betsey Cushing met James Roosevelt, the eldest son of Franklin Delano Roosevelt and Eleanor Roosevelt, when she was 22.         They married at St. Paul's Episcopal Church in Brookline, Mass., on June 5, 1930, two days before the bridegroom's graduation from Harvard. Five hundred leaders of the social and political worlds of Boston and New York watched the bride, in a floor-length gown of silver lame, exchange vows with the son of the Governor of New York and his wife. Elliott Roosevelt was his brother's best man, and two other brothers, Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr. and John A. Roosevelt, were among the ushers. Minnie Cushing was the maid of honor, and Babe Cushing was a bridesmaid.         As a young married woman, Betsey Cushing Roosevelt ''could be imperious,'' the fashion photographer Horst P. Horst later told Mr. Paley's biographer, Sally Bedell Smith. But,  Ms. Smith wrote, ''Fortunately, Betsey redeemed herself with a rollicking sense of humor and an ability to kick up her heels.''         Not Exactly a Favorite Of Eleanor Roosevelt         The young Roosevelts spent their early married life living with the Cushings, while the bridegroom studied law at the Boston University Law School. When Mr. Roosevelt went into the insurance business, the couple bought a house and property in Framingham, Mass. After his father became President of the United States and chose him as an aide, the couple lived in Georgetown.         The young Mrs. Roosevelt was said to be the President's favorite daughter-in-law, but she enjoyed no such preference from Eleanor Roosevelt and was, in turn, not fond of her mother-in-law. ''The two women were simply too strong and too different in personal style and social preferences,'' Mr. Grafton wrote.         Betsey Roosevelt was often the hostess at the White House when Eleanor Roosevelt was absent. She was in the forefront on a summer day in 1939 when the President entertained King George VI and Queen Elizabeth at a picnic in Hyde Park, N.Y., at which the King ate his first hot dog. Later that day, when the President took the King and Queen for a drive along the Hudson River, the President asked Betsey Roosevelt to go along for company in the car.         Always family-conscious, she enhanced Babe Cushing's debutante season by giving a tea dance at the White House as a second coming-out party. She also introduced Minnie Cushing to Vincent Astor, and the two were married in 1940 after Mr. Astor divorced his first wife.         Even as a member of the President's circle, Betsey Roosevelt preferred a private life, and she did her best to shield her two daughters, Sara and Kate, from the public eye.         In November 1938, James Roosevelt left the Government and went to Hollywood to work in the movie business as an aide to Samuel Goldwyn. His wife followed him, but they separated, and early in 1940 it was disclosed that they were to be divorced. Mr. Roosevelt filed for divorce on grounds of desertion, and his wife filed a cross-complaint on grounds of desertion and cruelty.         In March 1940, Mrs. Roosevelt obtained a divorce decree. She was given custody of the children, child support, a settlement and further payments until she remarried.         Mr. Roosevelt went on to become a decorated Marine officer in World War II, a six-term Congressman from California and a delegate to the United Nations during the Johnson Administration. He died in 1991.         Early in 1942, rumors of a romance between Betsey Cushing Roosevelt and Jock Whitney began circulating in New York, Boston and Washington. He had been divorced in 1940 after 10 years of marriage to the former Mary Elizabeth Altemus.         The couple were married in a small, informal ceremony on March 1, 1942, in her widowed mother's East 86th Street apartment. The bride was 33 and the bridegroom 37.         After a honeymoon at Greenwood Plantation in Thomasville, Ga., one of Mr. Whitney's many residences, the newlyweds moved to Washington, where he ran the motion picture division of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs, headed by Nelson A. Rockefeller. Mr. Whitney later joined the Air Force, rose to colonel, was a German prisoner for 18 days in 1944 before escaping and got several decorations.         In 1949, Mr. Whitney adopted his wife's two daughters. The Whitneys moved to London in 1957, when President Eisenhower named Mr. Whitney Ambassador to the Court of St. James's. Mrs. Whitney renewed her friendship with the Queen Mother, whom she had met on the 1939 visit to America. Both Ambassador and Mrs. Whitney became close to Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip.         Mrs. Whitney spent a good deal of her time making the Whitney residences comfortable and welcoming. In his book, Mr. Grafton quoted a friend of hers as saying, ''The Jock Whitneys are just about as 'down-to-earth' as any people can be with a quarter of a billion dollars.''         White House Is Nice, But It's No Greentree         The residences that Mrs. Whitney had at her disposal over the years included, in addition to Greentree on Long Island and the plantation in Georgia, a town house and an elegant apartment in Manhattan; a large summer house on Fishers Island near New London, Conn.; a 12-room house in Saratoga Springs, N.Y., which the Whitneys used when they attended horse races there; a golfing cottage in Augusta, Ga., and a spacious house in Surrey, England, not far from the Ascot racecourse.         E. J. Kahn, Mr. Whitney's biographer, reported that years later one of the daughters, Kate, once took her own children on a tour of the White House. Mr. Kahn wrote, ''After inspecting it, they pronounced it nice enough but hardly on a par with Greentree.''         In addition, the Whitneys shared a renowned Kentucky horse farm, which also bore the name Greentree, with Mr. Whitney's sister, Joan Whitney Payson. It was later sold.         Mrs. Whitney established the Greentree Foundation in 1983 to assist local community groups, and she was its president. She was a benefactor of North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, built in the early 1950's on 15 acres donated by Mr. Whitney and Mrs. Payson.         Mrs. Whitney was also involved with the Museum of Modern Art, Yale University and New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center. The Modern received eight major paintings, by artists like Utrillo, Picasso and Seurat, from Mr. Whitney's estate, and Yale received six paintings, valued at $5 million at that time. New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center received a $15 million gift.         After her husband's death in 1982, Mrs. Whitney gave $8 million to the Yale Medical School, then the largest gift in the school's history. The National Gallery of Art got nine American and French paintings, which had been placed in a charitable trust during Mr. Whitney's lifetime. The trust also gave $2 million for acquisitions, and Mrs. Whitney chose a Toulouse-Lautrec painting from her husband's collection, ''Marcelle Lender Dancing the Bolero in 'Chilperic,' '' to give the gallery in his memory.         Mrs. Whitney made art history in 1990 by putting up for sale, by Sotheby's, one of Renoir's most famous paintings, the sun-dappled cafe scene ''At the Moulin de la Galette.'' It brought $78.1 million, then a record auction price for Impressionist art and the second-highest price for any artwork sold at auction.         Among Mrs. Whitney's many public activities were memberships on the boards of the Whitney Museum of American Art, the John Hay Whitney Foundation and the Association for Homemakers Service.         She is survived by her daughters, Kate Whitney and Sara Wilford, both of Manhattan; eight grandchildren, and 16 great-grandchildren.       
         Kasey Cisyk, an opera-trained singer who never made it to the Met but whose haunting coloratura soprano became one of the world's most listened-to voices, died on March 29 at her home in Manhattan. She was 44 and had been the singing voice of the long-running ''Have You Driven a Ford Lately?'' advertising campaign.         Her family said the cause was breast cancer.         In the capricious world of show business, she never enjoyed splashy success, but in the backwaters of her profession, where most singers, after all, spend their entire careers, Miss Cisyk, a tiny, slender woman with a smile as big as her heart, made her share of waves.         She worked as a backup singer for Carly Simon and Quincy Jones; she dubbed the Oscar-winning title song for the 1977 movie ''You Light Up My Life,'' and in the demanding world of commercial jingles, she was a star, one whose very anonymity was a critical asset.         It allowed her, for example, to amass a list of credits that included such archrivals as ABC, NBC and CBS; McDonald's and Burger King, American and Delta airlines and even Coke and Pepsi.         And for all her long run with Ford, Miss Cisyk also sang in the service of Chevrolet, Cadillac and Toyota.         It was her work for Ford that made her the envy of her colleagues. From the time she became the voice of Ford in 1981 until the campaign was finally retired two months ago, hers was the most ubiquitous voice in the land. In 1989, when the campaign was nearing the midpoint of its 17-year run, an industry record for a corporate soloist, Ford executives estimated that Miss Cisyk had been heard by a cumulative audience of 20 billion.         Maybe not what she had in mind when she was studying opera at the Mannes College of Music in Manhattan, but not at all bad for a Queens-born daughter of a Ukrainian virtuoso who wanted her to play the violin.         Miss Cisyk, whose father maintained a studio on the Lower East Side, learned the instrument when she was 5 (she also studied ballet), and after graduating from the High School of Music and Art in Manhattan, she dutifully accepted a violin scholarship to Mannes.         By the time she graduated she had switched to classical voice training, won encouraging praise for roles in student opera productions, and sung  ''Rigoletto'' in Ghent on a New York State scholarship in Belgium.         For all her promise, Miss Cisyk, whose father died when she was 17, was drawn away from opera and into the world of jingles by the pressing need to make a living.         She found work singing in clubs in New York, but for a while in the mid-70's she despaired of breaking into the tight-knit world of commercials. For months after she had circulated tapes to advertising agencies she heard nothing.         Then the executives got around to listening to the tapes, and the calls started coming in, slowly at first, but after six months of sporadic work, an entire industry seemed to make the simultaneous discovery that her voice was money in the bank.         Suddenly she was in such demand that a typical day, she later recalled, would begin with a 9 A.M. session for Trans World Airlines, followed by Coca-Cola at 11, Hartz Mountain at 1 P.M., Eastern Airlines at 2, Datsun at 3, L'Eggs at 5, McDonald's at 6, and, after all that, a recording session from 8:30 P.M. to 3 A.M.         By the time Ford came calling in 1981, she had learned to pace herself.         After an early marriage and divorce, she married Edward J. Rakowicz, a recording engineer, had a son, Edward W., now 7, and became as devoted a mother as she had been a dedicated singer.         But even after her cancer was diagnosed in 1992 and she began the long, painful ordeal of therapy, Miss Cisyk, who is also survived by her older sister, Maria, a concert pianist and teacher who lives in Ridgefield, Conn., continued to work, singing her last professional jingle just a few months ago.         She may never have made it to the Met or even had a popular hit record in the United States, but she was not a complete unknown in the world of music.         Miss Cisyk, whose given name was Kvita (Ukrainian for flower), adopted the professional name Kasey from her initials, intending to reserve Kvita for an opera career that never happened. She eventually found a use for it after all.         A woman who cherished her Ukrainian heritage, Miss Cisyk formed her own production company in 1988 and recorded two C.D.'s, one  (''Kvita'') of Ukrainian folk songs, the other (''Kvita Two Colors'') of Ukrainian love songs.         Both have been wildly popular among the 100 million far-flung Ukrainian expatriates and in Ukraine, where the woman who worked in the backwaters of American show business was regarded as a leading performer and is very much a household name.       
         Tammy Wynette, whose 1968 hit ''Stand By Your Man'' established her as a queen of country music, died yesterday in her sleep at her home in Nashville. She was 55.         Ms. Wynette had a history of health problems. The cause of death  was believed to be a blood clot, said Evelyn Shriver, a spokeswoman for the singer.         In her 25-year career, Ms. Wynette recorded more than 50 albums and sold more than 30 million recordings. ''Stand By Your Man'' made her  synonymous with the role of a long-suffering but determinedly loyal wife, holding the family together even when her husband strayed.         Her voice had a husky center, with melancholy balanced by determination; she sounded like an Everywoman with unexpected reserves of strength and affection. Working with  Billy Sherrill as producer, she also became the standard-bearer of an elaborately orchestrated Nashville sound, with pedal steel guitars underlined by strings and backup choruses.         Ms. Wynette's own life was more turbulent, and less stable, than the lifelong attachments her songs promised.         She was born Wynette Pugh in 1942 in rural Itawumba County, Miss., and was raised by her grandparents on a farm where she picked cotton. She was drawn to music and learned to play guitar before she became a teen-ager, when she joined her mother in Birmingham, Ala.         A month before her high school graduation in 1959, she was married for the first time, to Euple Byrd. She had three daughters with him: Gwen, Jackie and Tina. The couple was divorced in 1965.         In 1963, she had enrolled in beautician's school in Tupelo, Miss. Working by day as a beautician and at night as a singer in clubs, she began appearing on local television and then on Porter Wagoner's syndicated country television show.         In 1966, she moved to Nashville and auditioned for Mr. Sherrill, who signed her to Epic Records. He renamed her Tammy Wynette and recorded some honky-tonk-flavored songs, including the ballad ''Apartment No. Nine'' and the uptempo ''Your Good Girl's Gonna Go Bad,'' her first Top 10 hit, in 1967. ''I Don't Wanna Play House'' reached No. 1 on the country charts and brought her a Grammy award. She married a second time, to Don Chapel, a singer, but the marriage lasted only a year.         Her three No. 1 hits in 1968 -- ''Stand By Your Man,'' ''Take Me To Your World'' and ''D-I-V-O-R-C-E'' -- established both her public image and her style, concentrating on weepers about holding a marriage together and unending love. ''Stand By Your Man,'' written by Ms. Wynette and Mr. Sherrill, sold more than two million copies.         As the song moved from country radio stations to the pop Top 20, she married George Jones, the country singer who had been her idol. ''Stand By Your Man'' brought her a second Grammy Award as well as recognition from the Country Music Association as female vocalist of the year in 1969 and 1970. She and Mr. Jones had a daughter, Georgette, in 1970.         Through the 1970's, she recorded duets with Mr. Jones, even continuing after they were divorced in 1975; the duo had No. 1 country hits with ''Golden Ring'' and ''Near You.'' In 1976, she married and divorced Michael Tomlin.         Two years later, she married George Richey, with whom she wrote the song '' 'Til I Can Make It on My Own.'' Her autobiography, ''Stand By Your Man,'' was published in 1979.         Her career fluctuated in the 1980's, with Top 10 hits including ''Another Chance'' in 1982 and ''Sometimes When We Touch,'' a duet with Mark Gray, in 1985. She acted in the soap opera ''Capitol'' in 1986, but also spent part of the year at the Betty Ford clinic fighting an addiction to prescription painkillers. She was recognized as a major figure in country music, with younger performers, including Emmylou Harris and Vince Gill, appearing on her albums. Although her hits reached the Top 20 less often, her voice was immediately recognizable. In 1992, she had an unexpected international hit when she sang ''Justified and Ancient'' with the English electronic dance group, the KLF; the song reached No. 1 in 18 countries.         Ms. Wynette became a part of the 1992 Presidential campaign after Hillary Rodham Clinton, stressing that her support of her husband was more than routine, told an interviewer, ''I'm not sitting here like some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette.''         Ms. Wynette demanded, and received, an apology. Ms. Wynette said Mrs. Clinton had ''offended every true country music fan'' and every person who has ''made it on their own with no one to take them to a White House.''         Ms. Wynette later performed at a Clinton fund-raiser.         In 1993, Ms. Wynette teamed with Dolly Parton and Loretta Lynn to record the album ''Honky-Tonk Angels.'' She was hospitalized in 1994 for stomach problems but returned to touring soon afterward.         Her last album, ''One,'' released in 1996, was a reunion with Mr. Jones.         Ms. Wynette had performed as recently as two weeks ago, and had been preparing for a live performance on May 8 on TNN with Melissa Etheridge and Trisha Yearwood, said Ms. Shriver, her spokeswoman.         She is survived by her husband, George Richey; five daughters, Jackie Daly, Gwen Ignaczak and Tina Jones, all of Nashville, Georgette Smith of Alabama and Deirdre Richardson of Los Angeles; a son, Kelly Richardson of San Francisco,  and seven grandchildren.

         Tammy Wynette, whose 1968 hit ''Stand By Your Man'' established her as a queen of country music, died on Monday in her sleep at her home in Nashville. She was 55.         She recorded more than 50 albums and sold more than 30 million recordings. Ms. Wynette, who had a history of health problems, is believed to have died of a blood clot, said her publicist, Evelyn Shriver.         ''Stand By Your Man'' established Ms. Wynette in the role of a long-suffering but determinedly loyal wife, holding the family together even when her husband strayed. Her voice had a husky center, with melancholy balanced by determination; she sounded like an Everywoman with unexpected reserves of strength and affection. ''I'm not the best singer in the world, just the loudest,'' she once declared.         Working with the producer Billy Sherrill, with whom she wrote her biggest hit, she also became the standard-bearer of an elaborately orchestrated Nashville sound, with pedal steel guitars underlined by strings and backup choruses.         She became the first female country singer to have a million-selling album, and she had 20 No. 1 country hit singles in her career. But her own life was more turbulent, and less stable, than the lifelong attachments her songs promised.         She was born in 1942 in rural Itawamba County, Miss., named Virginia Wynette Pugh, and raised by her grandparents on a farm where she picked cotton. She was drawn to music, and learned to play guitar before her teen-age years, when she joined her mother in Birmingham, Ala.         A month before her high school graduation in 1959, she was married for the first time, to Euple Byrd. She had three daughters with him: Gwen, Jackie and Tina. In 1963, she enrolled in beautician's school in Tupelo, Miss.; she was divorced in 1965. Working by day as a beautician and at night as a singer in clubs, she began appearing on a local television program, the ''Country Boy Eddie Show,'' then on Porter Wagoner's nationally syndicated country television show.         In 1966, she moved to Nashville and auditioned for Mr. Sherrill, who signed her to Epic Records. He renamed her Tammy Wynette and recorded some honky-tonk-flavored songs: the ballad ''Apartment No. Nine'' and the uptempo ''Your Good Girl's Gonna Go Bad,'' her first Top 10 hit, in 1967. ''I Don't Wanna Play House'' reached No. 1 on the country charts and brought her a Grammy Award.         The three No. 1 hits she had in 1968 -- ''Stand By Your Man,'' ''Take Me to Your World'' and ''D-I-V-O-R-C-E'' -- established both her public image and her style, concentrating on weepers about holding a marriage together or declaring her unending love. ''Stand By Your Man'' sold more than two million copies. In it, she sang: ''Sometimes it's hard to be a woman, giving all your love to just one man. You'll have bad times and he'll have good times doin' things that you don't understand. But if you love him, you'll forgive him even though he's hard to understand. And if you love him, oh be proud of him 'cause after all he's just a man.''         She had married the songwriter Don Chapel in 1967, but the partnership lasted only a year. It ended when Ms. Wynette walked out on her husband to live with George Jones, the revered and, at the time, hard-drinking country singer. According to Mr. Jones's autobiography, ''I Lived to Tell It All'' (1996), he had fallen in love with Ms. Wynette while they were on tour together.         One night, visiting her at home, he walked in while she and her husband were having an argument. After kicking over a dining room table, Mr. Jones declared his love for her, and Ms. Wynette and her three daughters left Mr. Chapel that night. A day later, Mr. Jones and Ms. Wynette flew to Mexico for a quick divorce, only to find out on their return that Tennessee did not recognize Mexican divorces. Mr. Chapel sued Mr. Jones for alienation of affection and Ms. Wynette for divorce. But Mr. Jones's lawyers discovered that Mr. Chapel and Ms. Wynette had married illegally, because she had married too soon after her previous divorce.         As ''Stand By Your Man'' moved from country radio stations to the pop Top 20, Ms. Wynette married Mr. Jones in 1969, and they began billing themselves as ''Mr. and Mrs. Country Music.'' They moved to Lakeland, Fla.         ''Stand By Your Man'' brought Ms. Wynette a second Grammy Award as well as recognition from the Country Music Association; she was named female vocalist of the year in 1969 and 1970. She and Mr. Jones had a daughter, Georgette, in 1970. But the marriage was a troubled one. In her 1979 autobiography, ''Stand By Your Man,'' Ms. Wynette wrote that one night he menaced her with a rifle while in a drunken rage, firing in her direction as she ran from him and then shooting up their Lakeland mansion; his autobiography denies the account. The next morning, he was straitjacketed and hospitalized for 10 days.         From 1971 to 1980, she recorded duets with Mr. Jones. Among them were songs like ''We're Gonna Hold On,'' which appeared amid reports of their marital troubles and rumors of impending divorce. The duo had No. 1 country hits with ''Golden Ring'' and ''Near You.'' But their marriage could not survive Mr. Jones's drinking and the couple's increasingly bitter quarrels. In 1975 they were divorced, although they continued to record duets. Ms. Wynette married Michael Tomlin in 1976, then divorced him after 44 days. Two years later, she married George Richey, with whom she wrote the song '' 'Til I Can Make It on My Own.''         Ms. Wynette's career fluctuated in the 1980's, with Top 10 hits including ''Another Chance'' in 1982 and ''Sometimes When We Touch,'' a duet with Mark Gray, in 1985. She acted in the soap opera ''Capitol'' in 1986. But she also spent part of the year at the Betty Ford Clinic fighting an addiction to prescription painkillers. She was recognized as a major figure in country music, with younger performers including Emmylou Harris and Vince Gill appearing on her albums, but her songs reached the Top 20 less often.         Yet her voice was immediately recognizable. In 1992, she had an unexpected international hit when she sang ''Justified and Ancient'' with the English electronic dance group, the KLF. The song reached No. 1 in 18 countries.         In 1992, her name and best-known song entered the Presidential campaign when Hillary Rodham Clinton, stressing that her defense of her husband against charges of adultery was more than routine, said in a ''60 Minutes'' interview: ''I'm not sitting here like some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette.''         Ms. Wynette demanded, and received, an apology, declaring that Mrs. Clinton had ''offended every true country music fan'' and every person who has ''made it on their own with no one to take them to a White House.'' After the apology, Ms. Wynette performed at a Clinton fund-raiser. ''Her trademark style has filled our hearts and made her a legend,'' President Clinton said yesterday.         In 1993, Ms. Wynette made an album, ''Honky-Tonk Angels,'' with Dolly Parton and Loretta Lynn. She was hospitalized in 1994 with an infection that left her in critical condition for a week. But she returned to touring and recording soon afterward, including a guest appearance on Elton John's album ''Duets.'' Her last recordings reunited her with Mr. Jones to sing duets on the 1996 album ''One.''         In addition to her husband, George Richey, she is survived by five daughters, Jackie Daly, Gwen Ignaczak and Tina Jones, all of Nashville, Georgette Smith of Alabama and Deirdre Richardson of Los Angeles; a son, Kelly Richardson of San Francisco and seven grandchildren.

         Diana Epstein, a onetime New York book editor whose prosaic need to replace some plastic (ugh!) buttons on a stylish new jacket led her down a rabbit hole of miniature wonder into an enchanted world awash in buttons, died on April 3 at Beth Israel Hospital North near her tiny town house on the Upper East Side. She was 61 and a founding proprietor of Tender Buttons, the small East 62d Street shop devoted exclusively, ecstatically, extravagantly to buttons.         Her friend and business partner, Millicent Safro, said the cause was an infection contracted during treatment for the flu.         Until that fateful day in 1964 when she set out on her lunch hour to buy some decent buttons, Ms. Epstein had been a more or less normal New York career woman, albeit one with a decided artistic flair and a vague feeling that literature might not be her true calling.         A native of New York City who was adopted by an aunt, Ms. Epstein had grown up in Chicago, graduated from the University of Chicago and studied at the Art Institute of Chicago before coming to New York, where she held a series of editing jobs and tried her hand at writing, once taking off six months to work on a novel in Greece.         For all her soaring imagination, Ms. Epstein could never have dreamed up what happened to her after she arrived at the ramshackle East 77th Street shop where she had bought buttons before and found that the proprietor had died and the store was shuttered.         Acting on what she recalled only as an inspired whim, Ms. Epstein tracked down the owner's heirs, paid them $5,000 for the entire stock of several hundred thousand buttons dating to the 1930's, and then, with no place to keep them, rented the store, and, somewhat dazed by her impetuous investment, tried to figure out what to do next.         A few weeks later, at a party at the store for an artist friend, she got the answer: One of the guests was Ms. Safro, a young antiques restorer who took one look at Ms. Epstein and the jumble of crushed and torn cartons of buttons and decided to set them straight.         It was the beginning of a remarkable partnership, and by the time Ms. Safro had helped Ms. Epstein organize the hoard of buttons the friends had backed into a business they knew nothing about.         As Ms. Epstein later recalled, the women, who had no real notion of opening a business, made their first sale when one of the store's former customers wandered in one day and bought six red buttons for a penny apiece in what may or may not have been a bargain: The women had no idea what any of their buttons were worth, but they soon made a point to find out, reading virtually everything ever written about buttons, which date to ancient Egypt but have been a collecting craze only since the Depression, and pumping experts in the field.         By the time they moved the store to its present location, at 143 East 62d Street, in 1968, they had become experts themselves.         Ms. Epstein had published the first of her three books on buttons, and, to their eventual dismay, both had become so hopelessly hooked on buttons that selling a treasured set would make them cry.         Business is business, however, and they made the best of it, purchasing a series of important collections, making two extensive buying trips abroad each year and making their store such a valuable resource it was a wonder how such celebrity regulars as Joan Bennett, Candice Bergen, Bill Blass, Oleg Cassini, Julie Christie, Claudette Colbert, Catherine Deneuve, Greta Garbo, Rose Kennedy, Calvin Klein, Ralph Lauren, Ali MacGraw, Paloma Picasso, Sidney Poitier, Isabella Rossellini, Susan Sarandon, Brooke Shields, Carly Simon, William Styron and Tom Wolfe could have got by without them, not to mention Kermit the Frog.         (The two women, who delighted in tracking down Muppet buttons in the precise shade of Kermit green, also supplied the playing card buttons for Jack Nicholson's jacket as the Joker in ''Batman.'')         Although Ms. Epstein believed that the quality of the store's vast selection spurred designers to upgrade their buttons, it has not been unusual for a customer to go straight from, say, Bergdorf's to Tender Buttons to buy an even better set of buttons for a newly purchased dress or suit.         In a store with thousands of different blazer button designs and tens of thousands of unique sets, Ms. Epstein, who saw buttons as art, catered to both collectors and customers seeking a single replacement for a missing shirt button or a striking set for a new garment.         She was so familiar with her stock that she would go unerringly to the box holding the exact match for a customer's missing button on a pair of Brooks Brothers pajamas.         Ms. Epstein's personal credo was that buttons should never speak louder than the dress or jacket they adorn, no cinch, to be sure, in a store much of whose inventory fairly shouts, but then her own clothes tended to be handmade to her own design from fine fabrics purchased abroad.         Operating a store that is as much museum as emporium, its walls lined floor to ceiling with small gray boxes holding more than a million ancient, antique and modern buttons in a profusion of materials, shapes and sizes with designs ranging from miniature fine art to cut-down kitsch, seemed to stimulate Ms. Epstein's artistic talents.         A large woman of surprising grace, she developed an interest in all things small, and became famous among her friends for her miniature watercolor collages, which led to a line of button-adorned greeting cards (''Berry Christmas'').         She was also known for her ''little'' dinners, generally served on small plates on children's furniture, but once, for a visiting niece who really wasn't very hungry, she served up breakfast on doll house china.         Ms. Epstein, who is survived by two brothers, Mel and Sheldon Green, and a sister, Barbara Levin, all of Chicago, where Tender Buttons also has a store, made sure the business would survive her. Ms. Safro, her heir, said it would continue.       
         Marjory Stoneman Douglas, the spirited writer and environmentalist who was known as the patron saint of the Florida Everglades for her ceaseless campaign to preserve the fragile wetlands, died yesterday at her home in Miami. She was 108.         Mrs. Douglas, who prevailed in recent years over blindness, hearing difficulties and other ailments, died in the English-style cottage she had built on a leafy street in Miami's Coconut Grove neighborhood in 1926.         ''The years caught up with her,'' William T. Muir, a lawyer and friend, told The Associated Press. He said that after cremation, her remains would be scattered over a portion of  Everglades National Park that bears her name.         The author of many short stories, novels and works of nonfiction, Mrs. Douglas was best known for her 1947 call to arms, ''The Everglades: River of Grass,'' which was at once a natural and political history and a  warning of what was to come if developers and other commercial interests were permitted to have their way with the unique wetlands that cover much of southern Florida.         The book became a best-seller and transformed public perception of the wetlands, which were then considered by most people to be useless swamps that should be drained and developed for farming and housing.  The novelist John Hersey, reviewing the book for The New York Herald Tribune, called it ''a remarkable almost poem'' and said that in the years to come, it would remain ''unique in any company.''         Mrs. Douglas began her book simply: ''There are no other Everglades in the world.''         ''The simplicity, the diversity, the related harmony of the forms of life they enclose. . . . It is a river of grass,'' she wrote.         Her phrase ''river of grass'' caught the public imagination but it was also a reference to the fact that the Everglades is really a vast, slow-moving stream of shallow water and saw grass that covers much of the final 100 miles of South Florida.         Mrs. Douglas was considered an authority on the delicate ecosystem of the Everglades, which is home to ibises, roseate spoonbills, wood storks, manatees, the threatened Florida panther and saltwater crocodile, and hundreds of other animals, fish and plants. But in her book she made her case with a rare blend of science, local lore and history, and shimmering writing: ''The clear burning light of the sun pours daylong into the saw grass and is lost there, soaked up, never given back. Only the water flashes and glints. The grass yields nothing.''         In 1947, the year her book was published, she also helped lead the campaign to have the central core of the Everglades preserved as Everglades National Park.         Long before water problems began to plague South Florida, Mrs. Douglas cried out against poor land management and the ill-planned creation of canals that, in effect, decreased the amount of fresh water in the Everglades and increased the amount of salt water, imperiling the ecosystem.         She deplored state and local policies that encouraged overdevelopment of the Everglades and threatened the very source water on which South Florida depends. Of the people of South Florida, she said, ''They could not get it through their heads that they had produced some of the worst conditions themselves, by their lack of cooperation, their selfishness, their mutual distrust and their willful refusal to consider the truth of the whole situation.''         She added that unless people acted more responsibly, ''overdrainage will go on'' and ''the soil will shrink and burn and be wasted and destroyed, in a continuing ruin.''         But in ''The Everglades: River of Grass,'' she expressed the hope that ''perhaps even in this last hour, in a new relation of usefulness and beauty, the vast, magnificent, subtle and unique region of the Everglades may not be utterly lost.''         In 1969, she helped found Friends of the Everglades, a conservation organization that now has 5,000 members. Joe Podgor, the former executive director, called her ''the giant on whose shoulders we all stand.''         In 1990, on her 100th birthday, when she was blind and frail, she continued to speak out against those who plundered the Everglades. And as damaged as the Everglades were, the fact that any of it remained was in large measure a tribute to her perseverance.         Roderick J. Jude, a longtime leader of the Florida chapter of the Sierra Club, said, ''The Everglades wouldn't be there for us to try to continue to save if not for her work through the years.''         Once an area of more than 4,000 square miles, the Everglades has shrunk to less than half its original size, the result of overdrainage, urban sprawl and pollution from government-supported sugar cane and dairy farming. Many think its long-range future is still tenuous.         In 1996, President Clinton endorsed a project to protect the Everglades by spending several hundred million dollars to buy farmland, take it out of production and try to restore the kind of natural water flow that Mrs. Douglas warned the state it was in danger of losing.         The proposal was strongly opposed by farmers, who saw it as an erosion of agribusiness. The sugar farmers asserted it was not their activities that damaged the Everglades as much as government drainage and flood control projects that turned wetlands into dry land so that it could be used for urban development.         In 1996, the voters of Florida approved a constitutional amendment for the cleanup of the Everglades,  but rejected a penny-a-pound tax on sugar to pay for it. The sugar growers convinced a majority of voters that the tax would have cost thousands of jobs.         The following year the Clinton Administration and the State of Florida agreed to buy more than 50,000 acres of sugar cane fields on the outskirts of Everglades National Park, a step toward rescuing the endangered ecosystem from polluted runoff.         A comprehensive restoration plan for the Everglades is expected later this year from the Army Corps of Engineers, which together with the South Florida Water Management District, a state agency, has been directed by Congress to oversee the huge replumbing project designed to restore the flow of fresh, clean water on which the Everglades depends.         Marjory Stoneman was born April 7, 1890, in Minneapolis, the daughter of Frank and Lillian Stoneman. Her father was a judge who became the first editor of the paper that eventually became The Miami Herald; her mother was a concert violinist.         Mrs. Douglas was raised in Taunton, Mass., and went to Wellesley College, where she majored in English, graduating in the class of 1912. Two years later she married a newspaperman named Kenneth Douglas, but realizing her marriage was a mistake she went to Miami, where she became a reporter at her father's newspaper. During World War I, she served with the American Red Cross in France, Belgium, Italy and in the Balkans.         Back in Miami after the war, she obtained a divorce and was reunited with her father at The Herald, becoming assistant editor, writing editorials and editing a literary column called ''The Galley.'' Her editorial writing presaged ''The Everglades: River of Grass,'' in that she began to explore the problems associated with Florida's rapid commercial development.         In 1923 she left The Herald to try free-lancing and sold her first story to The Saturday Evening Post. In 1928 she won second place in the O. Henry Memorial Prize for short story writing. In 1937, another of her short stories, ''Story of a Homely Woman,'' was included in a selection of the best Post stories published that year. Her first novel, ''Road to the Sun,'' which she worked on for 10 years, was published in 1951. It was the first of several works she would create for young readers.         Among Mrs. Douglas's other works were ''The Key to Paris,'' a book for young readers published in 1961, and a play, ''The Gallows Gate,'' in 1928. With John Rothchild she wrote ''Voice of the River,'' in 1987, an autobiography that told of her fierce advocacy of conservation measures to save the natural environment of South Florida.         Her short stories appeared in many magazines, including The Saturday Evening Post, Collier's and Women's Home Companion.         In addition to her writing, Mrs. Douglas taught at the University of Miami from 1925 to 1929 and also lectured at Pennsylvania State University in the late 1920's. She served on the editorial board of the University of Miami Press and for a time wrote book reviews. Among her other interests was the Junior Museum of Miami and the Coconut Grove Slum Clearance Association. She was also a member of the Society of Women Geographers.         Mrs. Douglas, who had no immediate survivors, was honored in many ways. Queen Elizabeth visited her in 1991. Two years later, President Clinton awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom. The building in Tallahassee that houses the state Department of Environmental Protection is named for her. Also named for her are a nature center in Key Biscayne and several schools and parks elsewhere in Florida.         President Clinton said of Mrs. Douglas in a statement from Germany, ''Long before there was an Earth Day, Mrs. Douglas was a passionate steward of our nation's natural resources, and particularly her Florida Everglades.''         On her 100th birthday, Marjory Stoneman Douglas was asked if she had hope for the Everglades' survival. She answered: ''I am neither an optimist nor a pessimist. I say it's got to be done.''       
         Dr. Emily Mudd, a onetime college dropout who trained to be a landscape architect before the trajectory of her life and her own inner fire led her to become a pioneering marriage and family counselor, died on Saturday at her home in Haverford, Pa. She was 99 and widely regarded as a giant of the field she helped create.         At a time when more than 25,000 American marriage counselors treat some 2 million troubled marriages a year, it might seem a shade surprising that in 1933, when Mrs. Mudd helped form the Philadelphia Marriage Council, the field was so new there were only two other such organizations in the country.         There were also no established training programs for marriage counselors, which might help explain why her fellow organizers asked Mrs. Mudd to run the Philadelphia program even though she did not have an academic degree.         But she did have a few other credentials. For one thing, she and her husband, Stuart, a microbiologist at the University of Pennsylvania, had helped start Pennsylvania's first birth control clinic six years earlier, and her experiences there dealing with often overburdened and sometimes abused wives had led her to see the need for broader family counseling.         Then, too, Mrs. Mudd was the only wife and mother among the academics and social work specialists who met at the Mudds' home to plan the marriage council.         The men were so impressed with their hostess's drive, insights, intuition and commitment that after an elaborate search for a qualified professional, they decided she would be the best person to run the council. It certainly would have been hard to find anyone more dedicated to social change and human improvement.         As a student at Vassar when the United States entered World War I, she was so determined to do her part for the cause that she helped form a Vassar unit of the women's Land Army, established to have women work the fields in place of mobilized farmers.         Her own role in that unit and as a Vassar student came to an end when she drank some fetid water, developed typhoid fever and was advised to avoid stuffy classrooms and seek a career in the fresh air. Accordingly, she studied landscape architecture at a school in Groton, Mass., but before she could begin a career she was diverted by romance.         After her marriage in 1922, Mrs. Mudd spent a decade as her husband's unpaid laboratory assistant, first at Harvard, later at the Rockefeller Institute in New York and then at the Henry Phipps Institute in Philadelphia, winning credit as co-author of 14 of his scientific papers.         After being asked to run the new Philadelphia Marriage Council, she returned to college. Working part time until she obtained a master's in social work from the University of Pennsylvania, Mrs. Mudd, who eventually received her doctorate there, became the council's full-time executive director in 1936 and held the post until her retirement in 1967.         Along the way she helped lay the groundwork for virtually every aspect of professional marriage and family counseling. She formed one of the first counselor training programs, developed the first program to measure counselor effectiveness, wrote several textbooks and lectured widely here and abroad.         Only the third woman to be named to the faculty of the University of Pennsylvania's medical school, Dr. Mudd, who later became the first woman to become a full professor there, taught the first course at an American medical school dealing with sexuality, a speciality that led her to help edit Alfred Kinsey's book on female sexuality and to work closely with the Masters and Johnson clinic in St. Louis, to which she contributed thousands of case histories from her own practice.         After her retirement from the Philadelphia Marriage Council, now affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania, Dr. Mudd, who remarried after her first husband's death in 1975, continued to see patients well into her 80's. She also found time to pursue her old landscaping speciality by developing elaborate gardens at her suburban home.         She is survived by two sons, John, of Cambridge, Mass., and Harvey, of Bethesda, Md.; two daughters, Margaret, of Cold Spring, N.Y., and Emily Mitchell of Concord, Mass.; 10 grandchildren and 8 great-grandchildren.       
         Natasha Gelman, who with her husband, Jacques, amassed an outstandingly fine group of 20th-century European paintings and sculptures and who was a friend and patron of Frida Kahlo, Diego Rivera and many other Mexican painters, died on Saturday at her home in Cuernavaca, Mexico, after a long illness. She was 86.         Mr. Gelman's fortune was owed primarily to his share in the profits of the enormously successful Mexican movies that featured the comedian Cantinflas. Thanks to that fortune, the Gelmans could buy just about anything they liked in the way of art. They worked as a pair of equals, each of whom prized the other's opinion.         When the collection was shown at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York in 1989-1990, it was widely remarked that the Gelmans' major paintings by Balthus, Bonnard, Braque, Derain, Juan Gris, Fernand Leger, Joan Miro, Matisse, Picasso and others would ideally complement the Met's own 20th-century holdings.         After her husband's death in 1986, Mrs. Gelman had continued to add to the collection. Where there were holes in it, she aimed to fill them. Major examples of Leger, Max Ernst, Miro, Jean Dubuffet and late Picasso resulted. In the end she bequeathed the trove of European art to the museum, in a gift valued at more than $300 million.         Natasha Gelman was born Natasha Zahalkaha in Prostejov in what was then Bohemia. Raised in a convent, she attended schools in Vienna and, later, in Switzerland. Famous for her beauty, she traveled the world in a sophisticated and fearless way, and finally landed in Mexico, where she lived for the rest of her life.         Mexico City in 1939 was filled with music, dance, painting, sculpture, new movies and good conversation, and she made the most of it.         In December 1939, she was sitting reading a French newspaper in a hotel garden when a young Russian-born and very personable Frenchman came up and deftly made her acquaintance. Jacques Gelman was in Mexico as the representative of a French film company.         One day a friend advised him to take a look at a circus performer called Cantinflas. Mr. Gelman at once recognized his potential, and became both the producer of his prodigiously successful movies and a full partner in the company that they formed together.         After the Gelmans were married in 1941, they were able to live well and entertain lavishly. As new-minted Mexican nationals and pioneer inhabitants of Acapulco, they cut a wide and deep swath.         They had an extensive collection of work by living Mexican painters, and to the last day of Mrs. Gelman's life, Diego Rivera's memorably voluptuous portrait of her in her younger days dominated her salon in Cuernavaca. In the same room were paintings by Frida Kahlo that the couple had bought when Kahlo was happy to make a sale.         In her last years, Natasha Gelman lived somewhat apart from the world, but distant echoes of her past could occasionally be detected -- as when she would ask to be taken to the only restaurant in Cuernavaca that could produce a genuine Hungarian goulash.         Correction:  May 12, 1998, Tuesday  An obituary of the art collector Natasha Gelman on Wednesday referred incorrectly to her native region. Her birthplace, Prostejov, is in Moravia, not Bohemia. At her birth, around 1911, the region was part of Austria-Hungary, and it is now in the Czech Republic.       
         Mary Elizabeth Grenander, a longtime professor of English who was an authority on the American writer Ambrose Bierce, known for his satirical wit and his horror stories, died in her sleep on Thursday at her home in East Berne, N.Y. She was 79.         Professor Grenander, known as M. E. Grenander, taught at the State University of New York at Albany  from 1948 until she retired in 1989 as a Distinguished Service Professor of English. She was a former president of the New York American Studies Association.         Her many writings about Bierce, who was born in 1842 and went to Mexico in 1913 and vanished, appeared during more than two decades. Analyzing horror stories he wrote, she once said: ''The actual situation is harmful, with the protagonist conceiving it to be harmless and reacting accordingly.''         She edited and wrote the introduction for the book ''Poems of Ambrose Bierce'' (1995, Nebraska), which the literary journal American Notes and Queries, or ANQ, called ''a provocative volume'' that ''should spark further interest in Bierce.''         Professor Grenander received a Fulbright Fellowship and grants from institutions including the National Endowment for the Humanities, the New York Council for the Humanities and the Rockefeller Foundation.         She gave more than $1 million to SUNY Albany, including $500,000 to establish a professorship in memory of her husband, James W. Corbett, a  professor of physics at the same university, who died in 1994. Lisa James of the university's Office of University Relations said that Professor Grenander and her husband prospered ''through long-term investments in the stock market.''         She was born in Rewey, Wis., and received bachelor's and master's degrees and a doctorate, all in English from the University of Chicago, in the 1940's.         Her marriage to Jean Louis Auclair ended in divorce. She married Professor Corbett in 1972.         She is survived by two sisters, Charlotte White of Puyallup, Wash.,  and Karen Hanley of Miami, Fla.       
         Dame Catherine Cookson, a determined dockside waif who spun the dross of a squalid childhood into gold as one of Britain's most prolific and best-read novelists, died yesterday at her home in a Newcastle suburb. She was 91 and the author of more than 90 novels with a combined distribution of more than 100 million copies.         There's not much to be said for growing up coal poor in Tyneside, the industrial banks of the Tyne in northeastern England, even less for being shamed by an alcoholic mother and never knowing your father.         Then again, by the time she was finished, Dame Catherine had said quite a lot about the grim life she knew as a girl and illuminated in scores of novels, almost all of them set in the same working-class world she grew up dreaming of escaping.         British readers have not seemed to be able to get enough of Dame Catherine's gritty tales of family conflict, social despair and the debilitating effects of deprivation. Dame Catherine has not only regularly accounted for a third of the books circulated by Britain's lending libraries, but of the top 10 titles on last year's circulation list, nine were hers.         Yet she would have been hard-pressed to dream up a more unlikely heroine or a tale as compelling as the story of her own life.         Who, after all, would believe that a woman whose childhood humiliations included frequenting pawn shops, collecting driftwood from the Tyne, being sexually molested at 7 by her mother's boyfriend, and making daily runs to the pub to fetch her mother and tyrannical grandfather pails of beer would become a successful novelist?         Or that a woman whose adult tribulations would include the pain of four pregnancies ending in miscarriage and stillbirth and a devastating nervous breakdown would make an emotional breakthrough at 40, find salvation through writing and end up as Britain's 17th richest woman, with a fortune estimated at $23 million?         Even harder to believe is that Dame Catherine credited the spark that saved her life to her persistent belief as a girl that she was a lady.         It was a belief, she said, that was fired when an aunt mentioned that her father, a topic she could never discuss with her imperious mother, had been a gentleman. And what sort of gentleman would take his pleasure, then abandon a woman he had got with child? As the aunt explained, ''he wore an astrakhan collar, and he carried a silver-mounted walking stick and kid gloves. And, oh yes, he talked lovely.'' (Dame Catherine later speculated that her father had been a gentleman's footman.)         The notion that she had been born a lady took a startling turn when Dame Catherine, then known as Katie McMullen, read in a novel that it was a lady's duty to be educated, which she took to heart, beginning a lifelong habit of reading great books.         She found her immediate escape from poverty by working in laundries, rising to supervisor, saving her money, moving to the southeastern city of Hastings and opening a rooming house for men.         One of her lodgers was a shy, intellectual school teacher named Tom Cookson, and as Dame Catherine later told it, it was close to love at first sight. When she asked him in for coffee after their first movie date, the two sat up talking until after midnight. ''Now,'' she said, ''whether it was him, or whether it was me who first leaned to the other I don't know. But we kissed and that was that.''         After their marriage the couple were inseparable, but after experiencing a stillbirth and three miscarriages Mrs. Cookson, who suffered from a lifelong blood disorder, endured years of suicidal depression until her husband suggested she try to overcome her despair by writing.         Her first book, an autobiographical novel called ''Kate Hannigan,'' was published in 1950, when she was 44, and Mrs. Cookson was on her way. Averaging two books a years, she achieved something of a breakthrough in 1968 with her 19th novel, ''Katie Mulholland,'' and her autobiography, ''Our Kate.''         Although none won literary acclaim, a number of her books, including ''The Black Candle,'' and ''The Velvet Gown,'' were made into television movies, and Mrs. Cookson, an Officer of the British Empire since 1985, was made a Dame, the equivalent of a Knight, in 1993.         Her husband is her only survivor.       
         Ginette Mathiot, who taught French cooking to the French with such succinct authority that her basic book of recipes sold more than five  million copies, died on June 14 at a retirement home in Paris. She was 91 and best known for her 1932 classic, ''I Know How to Cook.''         In a country whose vaunted cuisine has been largely the province of men, the title of that book, Miss Mathiot's first, has a certain ring of defiance, and no wonder.         Born in Paris in an era when women in France had far fewer career choices than they do today, Miss Mathiot, who was chastising the French cooking establishment as a sexist, male-dominated bastion long after opportunities for women improved, chafed at the restrictions from the beginning.         If she couldn't do anything else, at least she could cook, and if anybody doubted her, it wasn't the generations of French homemakers who turned her book into the bible of the French kitchen.         Raised in an austere household headed by her father, a Protestant minister, she was a brilliant student in secondary school, becoming a disciple of Simone Weil, the ascetic philosopher and mystic. But when she expressed an interest in studying medicine, she was persuaded instead to take teaching courses at the Sorbonne and eventually to specialize in the French version of home economics as a more appropriate outlet for a woman than medicine.         She rose to the top of her academic field, becoming an inspector general in the French homemaking academy before French education authorities withdraw recognition of homemaking as an academic discipline.         By her own account Miss Mathiot  garnered a total of seven marriage proposals but her father rejected each of her suitors on religious grounds (none were Protestant) and although Miss Mathiot considered rebelling, in the end, she said, she found she couldn't and bowed to her family's wishes.         After she established a life and career away from her family, the proposals kept coming, but Miss Mathiot continued to reject them, she said, though for reasons of her own.         If it was a father's stern will that forced her to become a home economics teacher, it was another man's inspired whim -- and a bit of luck -- that led her from the backwaters of education to the front burner of French cuisine.         While Miss Mathiot was still studying to be a teacher at the Paris Training School of Homemaking at the beginning of the Depression, Albin Michel, a portly French publisher, decided that a cook book emphasizing nutrition might help his ailing business, not to mention his waistline, by appealing to what he perceived as a broad public fascination with the developments of modern science, including advances in nutritional understanding.         When leading authorities on French cuisine turned him down, Mr. Michel proposed the project to the head of a local college's science department, who also turned him down but set off a chain of recommendations that finally led Mr. Michel to the 23-year-old Miss Mathiot, who said yes.         Her book, which included 2,000 recipes covering the canon of French cuisine from lobster bisque to crepe suzette, was an immediate sensation and paved the way for sequels, among them books on bread, pastry and even camping-trips cooking.         In addition to emphasizing nutrition, Miss Mathiot's books appealed to family cooks because they showed how to keep food costs down while remaining true to the spirit of French cooking.         Like ''The Joy of Cooking'' in the United States, ''I Know How to Cook'' and other Mathiot books served as primers for novice cooks, leading readers from the basics of food preparation through simple recipes to more elaborate concoctions.         A woman who presided over what she saw as a kitchen with millions of stoves, Miss Mathiot, who leaves no immediate survivors, never took anything for granted.         Anyone following a cake recipe, for example, might think the end had been reached with the instruction to remove the cake from the oven, but Miss Mathiot, mindful of the distractions of a triumphant moment, would have one more instruction: turn off the oven.       
         Louise M. Davies, the San Francisco benefactor who gave the city she loved a $5 million concert hall in 1980, died on Monday at a retirement home in Portola Valley, Calif. She was 98.         Mrs. Davies, whose husband, Ralph K. Davies, an oil millionaire, died in 1971, bestowed millions of dollars on many cultural, educational and medical charities in the Bay Area, including the Exploratorium, the World Affairs Council, the Conservatory of Music, the University of San Francisco, Stanford University and the San Francisco Opera.         But she will no doubt be best remembered as the benefactor of the 3,000-seat, modern concert hall on Van Ness Avenue that bears her name, the home of the San Francisco Symphony. Before the hall was built, the orchestra had to share the War Memorial building with the San Francisco Opera. The completion of Davies Symphony Hall, next door to the opera house, allowed the orchestra to expand to a full 52-week season and add additional players. After the hall opened, she gave another $3 million as a fund to attract leading guest conductors. One of the first to come was Michael Tilson Thomas, who became the orchestra's music director three years ago.         When asked by an interviewer in 1990 why she had financed the building, Mrs. Davies, a down-to-earth woman, said simply, ''Because I had the money, and we certainly needed the hall.'' In that same interview, she added: ''I'm just learning after all these years that I have quite a lot of money. Isn't that something?''         Mrs. Davies was born fairly poor, on a remote cattle ranch in Plumas County. When her parents divorced, her mother moved with Louise and her three other daughters, eventually settling in Oakland, where Louise attended a Catholic boarding school. As a young woman, she held a $25-per-week job as a stenographer in Oakland for seven years, then moved to Los Angeles to try her chances at film acting. There she met her future husband, a young executive with Standard Oil. They married in 1925.         Mr. Davies rose to the rank of vice president of Standard Oil. But when the presidency eluded him, he left and formed his own oil company. He also ran American President Lines and the Natomas Company. In 1934 the couple bought 20 acres in Woodside, Calif., where in 1940 they built a magnificent house, which Mrs. Davies lived in until recent years.         She is survived by her daughter, Maryon Davies Lewis of San Francisco, five grandchildren and five great-grandchildren.         Speaking of Mrs. Davies on Monday, Nancy Bechtle, the president of the San Francisco Symphony Board, said, ''The crowning glory of her life was that hall, and every time she walked in, she was just thrilled to be there.''       
         Maxine S. Pfeffer, an assistant United States attorney in Manhattan whose prosecutions ranged from drug dealing to international art theft, died on Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center after a long battle with cancer. She was 37.         Ms. Pfeffer's achievements included her prosecution of 29 organized-crime figures in a major drug-trafficking case in 1994 and helping run a sensitive Justice Department investigation into allegations that high officials of the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service had deliberately misled Congress about overcrowding and security problems in the agency's Florida operations.         She had recently begun to specialize in art law. In one case last year that drew international attention, she prosecuted three people accused in the theft and attempted sale of more than $10 million worth of valuable drawings, including works by Rembrandt and Albrecht Durer.         The drawings had come from a cache of artworks that was originally part of a collection looted from the Bremen Museum in Germany at the end of World War II.         Bonnie Goldblatt, a United States Customs agent who worked on the case, said that Ms. Pfeffer -- whose friends called her Max -- loved art, and that they would visit museums together in what little spare time they had.         ''She kept her plate full of art cases,'' Agent Goldblatt said.         Ms. Pfeffer grew up in Brooklyn and attended Harvard, where she was an editor at The Crimson. After graduation in 1981 she worked for a year as a paralegal for Linda A. Fairstein, chief of the Sex Crimes Prosecution Unit in the Manhattan District Attorney's office, before entering Harvard Law School.         After graduating cum laude from there in 1985, Ms. Pfeffer worked for three years as an associate in the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison. She specialized in commercial litigation, but also took on extensive pro bono work in capital punishment cases. She went to the United States Attorney's office for the Southern District in 1991 and later worked closely there with Mary Jo White, the chief Federal prosecutor.         Ms. Pfeffer is survived by her husband, Khalid Chahi of Manhattan, a son, Sami, and her mother, Shirley Pfeffer of Brooklyn.       
         Catherine Kennedy, who after a  long struggle established one of the nation's first nursing centers for AIDS patients, died on Tuesday at her home in New Haven. She was 51.         The cause of death was pancreatic cancer, family members said.         Not long after moving to New Haven with her family in 1983, Mrs. Kennedy became aware of the lack of nursing centers and services for people with AIDS. Many were turned away by nursing homes. Some were being kept, at enormous expense, at hospitals essentially unequipped to treat them. Others were homeless.         She resolved to open a nursing center for AIDS patients but constantly encountered obstacles. She waged an eight-year struggle against  financial and political obstacles to establish the home. Her experiences, which became a case study for the Harvard Business School, exemplified how someone involved in social entrepreneurship could overcome  great odds.         After two years of research and attempts to raise money, she received a $60,000 grant from the Merck Family Fund. When she sought help from the State Legislature, she encountered indifference and fear of AIDS among the public, as well as hostility from legislators more interested in cutting health-care funds than increasing them.         But she gained the help of Lucie McKinney, the widow of Representative Stewart McKinney, who had died of AIDS, to plead her case with Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr.         The Governor was persuaded and,  with others, gained passage of a bill to provide special funding for her project that included daily patient costs that were substantially less than full hospitalization and $3 million to renovate an old factory in New Haven.         In 1995, the home opened in the reconverted factory as Leeway Inc.; Mrs. Kennedy ran it until last fall,  when she was forced to resign because of her illness. In that time about 150 patients have been treated.         Catherine Urwin Kennedy was born on Feb. 12, 1947 in Wallsend, England. She received a bachelor of arts in economics and a master's in economic history from the University of East Anglia in England, where she later taught. She also earned a master's degree at Yale's school of management.         She married Paul Kennedy, the author and Yale historian, in 1967.  Besides her husband, she is survived by three sons, James and Matthew, of New Haven, and John, of New York, and two brothers and two sisters, all of England.         It was through her affiliation with  Yale that she was able to apply for her patients' participation in the university's experimental research in  AIDS medication and treatment.         Mrs. Kennedy's original goal was to build a home to shelter and care for dying patients. But today, Leeway staff members said, nearly half  of the patients can be sent home with reasonable chances of survival.  Among them was Fred Tyson, who is going back to work as a casting director in Hollywood.         ''She got us involved,'' he said of Catherine Kennedy. ''And I truly believe I would not be alive if it weren't for her.''       
         Beatrice Snyder, a co-founder and former executive of Biocraft Laboratories, a maker of generic pharmaceuticals, died June 21 at Lenox Hill Hospital. She was 74 and lived in Cliffside Park, N.J.         The cause of death was complications from emphysema, said Harold Snyder, her husband.         The Snyders started Biocraft Laboratories, which specialized in generic antibiotics, in Fair Lawn, N.J., in 1964. Ms. Snyder, who headed the financial operations of the company and was responsible for developing the inventory system, held the titles of senior vice president and secretary. Mr. Snyder was chairman and chief executive. Eventually, all three of the couple's children worked in the company.         Biocraft, which Mr. Snyder said became the first generic pharmaceutical company to be listed on the New York Stock Exchange in 1985, had annual sales of $150 million when it was bought by Teva Pharmaceutical Industries in 1996. Ms. Snyder was elected to the Teva board.         Ms. Snyder graduated from Hunter College in 1945 with a bachelor's degree in statistics.         In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Beryl Snyder Trost, and two sons, Brian and Jay, all of New York, and five grandchildren.       
         Shirley Polykoff, the pioneering advertising woman who came up with a single double-entendre that changed the face, or rather turned the heads, of American society, died on Thursday at her home on Park Avenue. She was 90 and the author of the ''Does she . . . or doesn't she?'' slogan, which unleashed American women to choose the color of their hair.         In an era when hair color is no longer a fiat of nature but a routine fashion choice, it is easy to forget that as recently as the mid-1950's hair coloring was such an exotic exception to a cultural norm that only 7 percent of American women dared dye their hair, mainly actresses, models and other fast women.         Then in 1956 Miss Polykoff invented the ''Does she . . . or doesn't she?'' campaign for a tiny Bristol-Myers division known as Clairol. Almost overnight, the slogan became a national catch phrase, and dyed hair (although never thereafter, she made sure, known that way) went from declasse to de rigueur.         Attracted by the slogan and its reassuring tag line, ''Hair color so natural only her hairdresser knows for sure,'' within a decade nearly half of all American women were regularly coloring their hair, and sales of dyes, tints and rinses had soared from $25 million to $200 million a year, with Clairol accounting for more than half the total (as it does today with industry sales of more than $1 billion).         Once the lone female copywriter at the giant Foote, Cone & Belding advertising agency, Miss Polykoff became the agency's lone female executive vice president, the toast of Madison Avenue and the 1967 Advertising Woman of the Year.         For the Brooklyn-born middle daughter of Russian Jewish immigrants, especially one whose mother wanted her to be a boy, the triumph was hardly a fluke. From the time she was 11 and made ''$3 and change'' for 12 hours' work selling coats in a Brooklyn department store, Miss Polykoff had relished proving herself in the traditional masculine role of breadwinner.         By the time she arrived at Foote, Cone & Belding in time to take over the new Clairol account in 1955, Miss Polykoff, who had written her first advertising copy as a teen-age secretary at Harper's Bazaar, had long since established herself as a star in retail advertising, first for a series of department and variety stores, including Bamberger's and Kresge in Newark, then for New York agencies with retail accounts.         As one of the few women in a male-dominated industry selling almost exclusively to women, the traditional household purchasing agents, Miss Polykoff had an advantage over her sometimes obtuse colleagues, particularly those who told her the proposed ''Does she . . . or doesn't she?'' campaign was too suggestive.         In her 1975 book, ''Does She . . . or Doesn't She? And How She Did It,'' Miss Polykoff recalled that when similarly obtuse executives at Life magazine turned down a 10-page Clairol layout because of the double-entendre, she challenged them to poll the women in the magazine office.         When the dirty-minded executives could not find a single woman who thought the line had any smutty connotation, Miss Polykoff was not surprised. She had realized all along that well brought-up women of the 1950's, the Clairol target audience, would never admit, as she put it, ''that a nice girl ever got an off-color meaning about anything.'' The ad ran, and, as she recalled, ''everybody got rich.''         To some latter-day feminists, Miss Polykoff was somewhat perplexing, on the one hand an obvious pioneering role model for professional women, on the other a woman whose success, which included such campaigns as ''Is It True Blondes Have More Fun?'' and ''If I've Only One Life to Live, Let Me Live It as a Blonde,'' depended on catering to women's vanity as sex objects.         Miss Polykoff, who frankly used her femininity to charm men and who chided modern businesswomen who try to ape men, did not apologize. For all her ambition and outsized success as a woman, Miss Polykoff was cut from a pre-feminist mold, never forgetting, as she often put it, that she was ''a girl first and an advertising woman second.''         Growing up as the awkward middle daughter between two raven-haired beauties, Miss Polykoff, who saw her blond hair as her only physical distinction (at least until she began to develop what she called her ''sexy curves''), was so distraught when her hair began to darken as a teen-ager that she began having a local hairdresser lighten it, just to make the back match the front. That fiction sufficed until her future mother-in-law secretly asked her son the Yiddish foreshadowing of ''Does she  . . . or doesn't she?''         Miss Polykoff also unabashedly put husband and family above her career, going so far as to hold her Foote, Cone salary to $25,000 so as not to earn more than her lawyer husband, George P. Halperin. After he died in 1961, the agency doubled her salary twice in less than a decade, and when she retired in 1973 to open an agency under her own name she had been Foote, Cone's highest paid salaried employee for many years.         She is survived by two daughters, Laurie Zucker of Athens, Ohio, and Alix Nelson Frick of Manhattan, the president of Franklin Spier Advertising; a sister, Lillian Ovberg of Glen Cove, N.Y., and three grandchildren.         Correction:  June 15, 1998, Monday  An obituary last Monday about Shirley Polykoff, the advertising woman who devised the slogan ''Does she . . . or doesn't she?'' in 1956 to advertise hair coloring products, referred incorrectly to the ownership of the advertiser, Clairol. The company was independent at the time. It was acquired in 1959 by the Bristol-Myers Company, now Bristol-Myers Squibb.       
         Betty Lehan Harragan, a writer, consultant and advocate for women's equality in the workplace, died on Saturday at New York University Medical Center. She was 77 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause of death was lung cancer, according to Kathleen Harragan, her daughter.         Betty Harragan's book ''Games Mother Never Taught You: Corporate Gamesmanship for Women'' was published in 1977 by Rawson Associates; since then, more than one million copies have been published in paperback by Warner Books. The book is used in college undergraduate courses and business schools and was the basis for a television film of the same name starring Loretta Swit and Sam Waterston, broadcast by CBS in 1982 and 1985.         Another book by Ms. Harragan, ''Knowing the Score: Play-by-Play Directions for Women on the Job,'' was published by St. Martin's Press in 1983. Ms. Harragan also wrote articles and columns about careers for such magazines as Working Woman, Woman's Day, Mademoiselle and Savvy.         A 27-year member of the National Organization for Women, for which she frequently handled publicity and public relations, Ms. Harragan often addressed professional societies and seminars for female managers. She also testified before legislative committees on behalf of equal opportunity, equal rights and comparable pay for women.         A native of Milwaukee, she graduated from Marquette University in there in 1944. She received a master's degree in English literature in 1947 from Columbia University.         From 1950 to 1956, she edited employee publications for the New York Telephone Company and was a writer and publicist at the J. Walter Thompson advertising agency from 1963 to 1972. Later that year, Ms. Harragan started Betty Harragan & Affiliates, a consulting company that specialized in women's issues in the workplace.         Her husband, David J., died in 1962.         In addition to her daughter, Kathleen, of Boston, she is survived by three brothers, Robert Lehan of Tempe, Ariz.; Richard Lehan of Sacramento, Calif., and William Lehan of Anaheim, Calif.; two sisters, Geri Pollack of North Hills, Calif., and Judy Ascasio of Laguna Hills, Calif., and a grandson.       
         Chana Timoner, a onetime housewife with such a passionate devotion to tradition and social justice that she became first a rabbi and then the first Jewish woman to serve as a full-time Army chaplain, died on Monday at her home in New Haven. She was 46 and had received a medical discharge earlier this year after developing the Epstein-Barr virus.         Her husband, Dr. Julian Timoner, a chiropractor who persuaded state authorities to release the body without an autopsy, said he believed that his wife had accidentally taken a fatal overdose combination of her prescribed medication and her usual sleeping pills.         Anyone who was surprised when Ms. Timoner, then a self-styled housewife and couch potato, began five years of intense religious training at age 33 or who was surprised even more when she entered the Army and endured six weeks of grueling basic training at age 39, simply had not been paying attention.         For Ms. Timoner, a New Haven native whose father was a railroad carpenter, religion, the military and pushing limits were all family traditions.         Her Russian-born maternal grandfather had been a rabbi in New Haven, and her mother had been so eager to fight the Nazis in World War II that she joined the Canadian Army in 1940, a year before the United States entered the war and she was able to transfer to the newly organized Women's Army Corps.         By the time Ms. Timoner enrolled in Southern Connecticut State College in New Haven, she had developed expansive dreams that included later study at the University of Jerusalem.         Then she made the mistake of dropping by a local Jewish community center one night. Dr. Timoner was there, too, and, well, it's an old story, and by the time she began giving it her own personal twist, Ms. Timoner had been married at 18, had had two children by the time she graduated and had endured a grin-and-bear-it decade as a distinctly restless housewife and mother.         Ms. Timoner, who had always been deeply involved in religion and who had been struggling with herself over whether to become a rabbi, attributed her decision to begin religious studies in 1984 to a friend who told her one day: ''You know, in 7 years you could be a 40-year-old housewife or you could be a 40-year-old rabbi.''         The next day, Ms. Timoner said, ''I was on the phone,'' finding out how to enter rabbinical training.         She enrolled in the Academy for Jewish Religion in New York and spent the next five years making long daily trips to New York City. Then, after her ordination in 1989, she spent two more commuting years studying for a doctorate at the New York Theological Seminary, completing the course work but deferring her dissertation.         Although she was far from the first woman to become a rabbi, most had been affiliated with the liberal Reform Jewish tradition, and as a committed adherent of the more austere Conservative tradition, Rabbi Timoner had trouble finding a post.         Then when she did find one, as rabbi of the Beth El Synagogue in Wallingford, Conn., her career ran afoul of her own principles. When she refused to bend the rules to perform a bar mitzvah for a youth with a Jewish father and a gentile mother without the required religious circumcision ritual, she was forced to step down.         After working for the National Council of Christians and Jews and as a hospital chaplain, Rabbi Timoner joined the Army Reserves and in 1993 became the first Jewish woman to serve as a full-time chaplain in the regular Army.         On the day in 1993 that she began her first assignment, at Fort Bragg, N.C., her husband recalled yesterday, President Clinton announced his ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy on homosexuals in the military, prompting Rabbi Timoner to make an announcement of her own: she would gladly provide a full range of counseling for gay soldiers.         The position, which shocked her fellow chaplains at the base, was simply par for the Timoner course. When she had learned that homosexuals, even those with the AIDS virus, were being shunned by the Jewish religious establishment in Connecticut, she formed study groups for Jewish homosexuals and became active in AIDS organizations.         As the only Jewish chaplain at Fort Bragg, Rabbi Timoner held regular Friday services for the few Jewish soldiers at the base, but as the chaplain for a helicopter battalion there she spent most of her time counseling the soldiers, many of them women, none of them Jewish.         After a brief stint in Korea, where the Epstein-Barr virus and the related chronic fatigue syndrome were first diagnosed, Captain Timoner completed her Army service at Fort Benning, Ga., where, as usual, she made waves, especially when she insisted on adding prayers for Catholic, gay and gypsy victims of the Nazi terror at a Holocaust service.         No one should have been surprised. After all, when Elie Wiesel once addressed a large Jewish gathering at Yale and made an impassioned reference to ''the six million,'' Rabbi Timoner, who was sitting on the first row, had felt compelled to stand and chide him for not including the other oppressed groups who died in the gas chambers.         In addition to her husband, Rabbi Timoner is survived by her mother, Mary Surasky of Tampa, Fla.; a daughter, Aviva, of Paris; a son, Samson, of Germantown, Md.; a sister, Abby Sawilowsky, of Oak Park, Mich., and two brothers, Miron Surasky of Oakland, Calif., and Charles Surasky of Yardley, Pa.       
         Dorothy Carnegie Rivkin, an author and instructor who developed the Dale Carnegie Training company into a worldwide operation, died on Thursday after a long illness. She was 85 and lived in Forest Hills Gardens, Queens.         Mrs. Carnegie Rivkin, a native of Tulsa, Okla., was chairwoman of Dale Carnegie Training. In the 1940's and 50's she was married to the founder of the company, Dale Carnegie, who wrote the classic American self-help book ''How to Win Friends and Influence People.'' Mrs. Carnegie took control of company operations after Mr. Carnegie's death in 1955 and developed the business into a multinational one with offices in 70 countries, 5 million graduates and $187 million in annual sales.         With her strawberry blond hair, gleaming smile and rich Oklahoma twang -- Mrs. Carnegie was a student of Mr. Carnegie as well as his wife -- she proved as big a success in business as he was in motivational speaking. Though contemporaries in the 1950's wondered whether she had what it took to continue Mr. Carnegie's quintessentially enigmatic enterprise, she scoffed at such skepticism. She told a reporter in 1973 that she immediately took over the operations ''so that I have no time to sit and whittle and spit.''         Even before she met its creator, she had become an early devotee of the Carnegie approach to self-improvement. His book was first published in 1936 and took America by storm with its simple, upbeat message. Even the most retiring people can learn to wow a crowd, he wrote. Look people in the eye, shake hands firmly, flash a winning smile and remember names. Never complain or blame other people.         In the early 1940's, she was Dorothy Price Vanderpool, a divorced mother with a baby daughter to support because of what she called an ''unfortunate teen-aged marriage.'' She took a Carnegie course at a Y.M.C.A. in Tulsa and afterward credited the skills she acquired for the jump she made from stenographer in the Gulf Oil Corporation's accounting department to a senior secretary in the executive suite. She also became president of Tulsa's Young Republicans Club.         Her improvement so impressed Carnegie people that the company offered her a job in New York. She became Mr. Carnegie's secretary in January 1944 and, several months later, his second wife. He later made her his business partner.         Following his style, she collected anecdotes and how-to case histories for a book she wrote, ''How to Help Your Husband Get Ahead in his Social and Business Life,'' published in 1953. Among the homespun advice she offered wives eager to please their husbands were such aphorisms as ''Share his interests and ideals'' and ''Try some intelligent listening. Be a sounding board or a wailing wall.''         But Mrs. Carnegie put business before her personal writing and teaching interests. She once started the Dorothy Carnegie Course, a workshop for women, by women, in contrast to the male-centered Dale Carnegie program. It never took off financially, however, and her business instincts prevailed over her desire to offer a women-only alternative. She did preside over a sharp rise in the number of women taking the regular course.         Her genius was to transform Dale Carnegie Training into a staple of corporate America. She once contended that 400 of the Fortune 500 companies sent employees to study at the company. It became a right of passage for young executives who sought to develop the confidence to present themselves well in public settings. Companies, moreover, paid the enrollment fees, which can now surpass $1,000 for a two-week session.         Graduates were often the best advertisement. The chicken magnate Frank Perdue attended, as did Mary Kay Ash of Mary Kay cosmetics. So did Lee A. Iacocca, the former chief of the Chrysler Corporation.         ''For the first few years of my life I was an introvert, a shrinking violet,'' the sometimes brash auto executive wrote in his autobiography, ''Iacocca.'' ''But that was before I took a course in public speaking at the Dale Carnegie Institute.'' Even the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders spruced up their smiles with the help of Carnegie teachers.         Mrs. Carnegie had a casual working style. She vowed that employees would never find her sitting idly behind a desk. She dictated letters from the porch of her home in Forest Hills Gardens and ran meetings by telephone from her ranch in the Black Hills of Wyoming. She decorated her office with a bronze Philip La Verne conference table, an expensive statement of taste in the late 1960's.         Mrs. Carnegie remarried in 1976, to David Rivkin, also of Tulsa. She retired from active management of the closely held company in 1978 in favor of her son-in-law, J. Oliver Crom, though she remained chairwoman.         She is survived by Mr. Rivkin and her daughter, Donna Dale Carnegie of Lake Oswego, Ore. Another daughter, Rosemary Crom, died earlier. She is also survived by three grandchildren, seven great-grandchildren and three stepchildren.       
         Sybil Harrington, a philanthropist from Amarillo, Tex., who besides supporting medical, education and arts charities was the largest individual donor to the Metropolitan Opera in the company's history, died on Thursday in Phoenix, where she kept a winter home. She was 89.         Grand opera was her passion, Mrs. Harrington once told an interviewer from Town and Country magazine. ''It's all there -- beautiful sets, great costumes, great music,'' she said. ''What more could you want?''         And Mrs. Harrington liked her grand opera grand. Other patrons could back productions of Berg's ''Wozzeck'' and Britten's ''Peter Grimes.'' Her tastes went to Verdi, Puccini, Wagner and Mozart. She made possible some of the Met's most lavish and popular productions, like Franco Zeffirelli's ''Boheme,'' ''Tosca'' and ''Turandot'' and Otto Schenk's ''Meistersinger.'' She financed 16 new productions in total, most recently the Elijah Moshinsky production of Verdi's ''Otello'' introduced in the 1993-94 season. She also supported 13 ''Metropolitan Opera Presents'' television broadcasts, and provided funding for the company's computerized lighting board.         In 1980, Mrs. Harrington made a  gift of $20 million to the Metropolitan Opera endowment fund campaign. In acknowledgement of her extraordinary generosity, the company named the house's auditorium after her.  Marilyn Shapiro, the executive director for external affairs at the Met, estimated that Mrs. Harrington's donations to the Met totaled more than  $30 million.         As a director of the foundation she formed with her husband, Donald D. Harrington, a Texas oil man, Mrs. Harrington also contributed large sums to dozens of diverse charities and organizations, including the Deafness Research Foundation in New York and the Harrington Arthritis Research Center in Phoenix. She was especially attentive to the needs of the Texas Panhandle, providing money for everything from outdoor lights for softball fields in small towns like Gruver to a cancer treatment center outside Amarillo.         Mrs. Harrington was a fierce defender of private philanthropy over government support. ''We've got to have that free enterprise,'' she once said. ''It's important in charitable institutions as well as in business. Art has to have freedom.''         Mrs. Harrington was born Sybil Buckingham in Amarillo in 1908, the granddaughter of some of the first settlers in the remote region. As a child, she liked to fish and shoot, but she especially loved music and dance. She studied piano and organ, and ordered ballet shoes from a catalogue, persuading her mother to take her to Fort Worth for dance classes. Later, she loved listening to the first radio broadcasts of the Metropolitan Opera, which fired her love for the art form and the company.         A petite woman with a wry smile and quick wit, she married Mr. Harrington in 1935. They bought a 15,000-square-foot home in Amarillo built in 1914 by a cattle baron who, Mrs. Harrington often recalled, had had the grand Ionic columns that supported the portico hauled to Amarillo by mule train.         The couple's philanthropy began with some scholarships to Texas Tech University in Lubbock, and later with a ranch they bought and turned into the Don Harrington Boy Scout Camp. They established their foundation in 1961.         In 1974, Mrs. Harrington suffered two blows, the deaths of both her husband and, a few months later, their only child, Sally Harrington Goldwater, the wife of Robert Goldwater, the younger brother of Senator Barry Goldwater. Taking charge of the foundation was one way she  was able to cope with her loss.         She had been a regular contributor to the Met but had not thought of financing a production until it was suggested to her by friends on the Met's board. Her first gift made possible the production of Verdi's ''Don Carlo'' by John Dexter, introduced in the 1978-79 season. Mrs. Harrington immersed herself in the experience, attending rehearsals, talking with  cast and crew, dispensing advice. When someone suggested that a white horse and some Irish wolfhounds in one scene were distracting, Mrs. Harrington objected, and the animals remained in the cast.         Other productions she was responsible for, still in use by the company, include Puccini's ''Manon Lescaut,'' Johann Strauss's ''Fledermaus,'' Wagner's ''Rheingold'' and Mozart's ''Don Giovanni.'' She became a member of the Metropolitan Opera Association in 1968, a director of its managing board in 1970 and advisory director in 1978.         She is to be buried in Amarillo.         Commenting once on her work as a philanthropist, Mrs. Harrington said: ''Giving money away is hard work. But I got a kick out of it. I felt important for once in my life.''       
         Cleusa Millet, a former nurse who became the spiritual leader of one of the most celebrated Candomble temples in Brazil, died on Oct. 15 in Salvador da Bahia. She was 67.         Newspapers reported the cause of death as heart failure.         Known as Mother Cleusa, Mrs. Millet presided over the Candomble temple at Alto do Gantois in Salvador, Brazil's first capital, now home to a flourishing renaissance of Afro-Brazilian culture. Candomble is the strongest of Brazil's syncretist religions, mixing the nature-based beliefs some four million slaves brought from Africa with the Catholicism of the Portuguese colonists.         Its pantheon of orixas -- gods and goddesses of wind, oceans, still water, metals and fire -- correspond to Catholic saints, and appear in masks and swaying skirts of raffia.         Mother Cleusa took over the Gantois terreiro, as the temple is known, from her mother, Maria Escolastica da Conceicao Nazare, known as Mother Menininha, after her mother's death 10 years ago.         A towering figure in Afro-Brazilian culture, Mother Menininha helped transform Candomble from a belief whose rituals of animal sacrifice, possession, music and dance were persecuted as a form of devil worship to a religion accepted in the highest levels of society. Though initially reluctant to give up her nursing career, Mother Cleusa tended her mother and the Gantois temple during her mother's final years of ailing health, eventually agreeing to succeed her, if that were to be her fate.         She became the new high priestess through a ritual known as throwing the shells, in which the orixas are said to select the new spiritual leader of a temple through the shells. The Gantois is one of the few Candomble temples in Brazil whose leadership has passed along blood lines and has always been headed by a woman.         ''Mother Cleusa represented the continuity of an important line in Candomble,'' said Jeferson Bacelar, an anthropology professor at the Center for the Afro-Oriental Studies at the Federal University of Bahia.         Mother Cleusa was not known for initiating any dramatic changes in Candomble, but dedicated herself to tending what her mother had built. With the help of wealthy patrons, she renovated the temple and created a memorial to her mother that became a kind of museum of Candomble. She collected donations from the Brazilian rich and renown, some of whom have become devotees of Candomble with the religion's growing popularity in recent years.         Her friends and associates included the singers Gilberto Gil, Maria Bethania and Caetano Veloso, and the President of the Senate, Antonio Carlos Magalhaes. Several times, Mother Cleusa met with President Fernando Henrique Cardoso, who once said that he was born ''with one foot in the kitchen,'' an expression suggesting he was part black. The Governor of Bahia declared a day of official mourning for her.         ''She was a very fine person,'' said Zelia Gattai, a Brazilian writer. ''She would help anybody who needed her.'' Ms. Gattai's husband, Jorge Amado, the author, was also friends with Mother Cleusa.         ''She was very much like her mother,'' said Walson Botelho, artistic director of the Bale Folclorico da Bahia, who is a senior figure in another Candomble temple in Salvador. ''She had a conciliatory spirit, and was a good, honest person,'' said Mr. Botelho. ''She treated everybody the same, whether it was a poor person or the President.''         On Wednesday, the seventh day after her death, followers held the last funeral ceremony at her temple, Mr. Botelho said. In the center of the room were the objects she loved, including her favorite foods, clothes and belongings. The drums, which are associated with the orixas, remained silent.         The natural successor to Mother Cleusa is her eldest daughter, Monica Millet. Mother Cleusa is survived by three other children as well. They are Alvaro, Zeno Eduardo and Ana Carolina.         A percussionist for Mr. Gil and other top musicians, Monica Millet, 37, has said she does not intend to take her mother's place as the high priestess of Candomble. But then again, her mother was once heard to say the same.       
         Kathleen Lukens, a more or less ordinary woman whose life had such an ordinary focus on her children it is a wonder how much people made of what she saw as routine maternal devotion, died on Tuesday at her home in Tappan, N.Y. She was 67 and had been executive director of Camp Venture, a Rockland County service organization for the developmentally disabled that she founded in 1969.         Her family said the cause was cancer.         A 1952 Barnard College graduate who taught a year at a private girls' school and worked another year as a police reporter and feature writer for The Bergen Evening Record before marrying and settling into a suburban routine, Mrs. Lukens, who was born in Philadelphia and grew up in northern New Jersey, was typical of a generation of women who put their families before careers.         As a standard P.T.A. mom cum after-school chauffeur with the usual array of committee meetings and volunteer work, Mrs. Lukens, a labor organizer's daughter who was also active in the antinuclear and civil rights movements, did pretty much what any suburban mother of her era did. And if her refrigerator to-do list was a bit longer than most, she did, after all, have five children with varying needs to take care of.         As the children came along, Mrs. Lukens simply dealt with their needs as a matter of routine, feeding them, keeping them clean, nursing them through childhood illnesses and sending them off to school and camp.         It was a routine that varied only in the details. When her fourth son, David, turned out to be autistic, for example, and she discovered there were no camps in Rockland County for children with such developmental disabilities, Mrs. Lukens, who had previously helped start a nursery school for her three older sons, did the obvious thing: She started a camp for David.         She called it Camp Venture, and if at first it was more venture than camp, when it comes to taking care of children, one thing tends to lead to another, and almost before Mrs. Lukens knew it, David had grown up and she had built Camp Venture into a sprawling multiservice organization with an $18 million, largely Medicaid-financed, annual budget that now operates 15 supervised group homes, 4 day service centers and  other programs that serve about 1,000 Rockland County adults and children with an array of developmental disorders, including autism, Down syndrome and cerebral palsy.         To be sure, Mrs. Lukens, who told David's story in a 1989 novella, ''Song of David,'' had some help, including loving assistance from her husband, Dr. John H. Lukens, a clinical psychologist, from David's four siblings, including his little sister, and from other parents, some of whom moved to Rockland County so they could join Mrs. Lukens's enterprise and their children could benefit from Camp Venture.         Not that it was easy. At a time when the mentally retarded and those with other developmental disabilities were routinely warehoused in indifferent state institutions like the notorious Letchworth Village, to win the required government financing for supervised group homes, Mrs. Lukens had to become a public advocate, buttonholing politicians and organizing campaigns for reform.         Gov. Nelson A. Rockefeller was so impressed with her eloquent appeals that he asked her to become a speechwriter. In their turns, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo declared her New York State 1984 woman of the year and named her to his advisory council on mental retardation and developmental disabilities and Gov. George E. Pataki named her to the state Provider Council in 1996.         By then, Mrs. Lukens had received so many honors and heard so much  praise it was a wonder she had any time for her nine grandchildren.         Not surprisingly, perhaps, four of Mrs. Lukens's children grew up to go into some form of social work: her oldest son, Mark, is a minister in East Rockaway, N.Y.; Jonathan of Carmel, N.Y., and her daughter, Margaret Byrne, of Orangeburg, N.Y., are clinical social workers and Daniel, of Congers, N.Y., is his mother's successor as executive director of Camp Venture.         David, now 36, has what his family describes as a happy life, living at a Camp Venture group home in New City, N.Y., and participating in activities at a Camp Venture day services center, all thanks to the efforts of a more or less ordinary woman who saw her duty as making sure her children got the care they needed.       
         Marion Donovan, a onetime Connecticut housewife who had to change one damp diaper too many, died on Nov. 4 at Lenox Hill Hospital near her home in Manhattan. She was 81 and had helped spearhead an industrial and domestic revolution by inventing the forerunner of the disposable diaper.         Her family said the cause was heart disease.         Disposable was not what Mrs. Donovan had in mind in 1946 when her second daughter came along and proved as maddeningly reliable as the first: Put her down for a nap and by the time the light was out her diaper would be wet, and her clothes and crib sheet would soon be soaked and in need of changing.         With cloth diapers serving more as wick than sponge, and with rubber baby pants virtually assuring a nasty case of diaper rash, Mrs. Donovan started looking for a way to hold the dampness in without keeping the air out.         It's not that she was immune to the joys of motherhood. After all, after marrying James Donovan, a leather importer, and starting a family, Mrs. Donovan, a 1939 graduate of Rosemont College near Philadelphia, had willingly given up her job as an assistant Vogue beauty editor in New York and moved to Westport, Conn.         It's just that unlike many stay-at-home mothers of the day Mrs. Donovan, as befitting a woman who would eventually obtain more than a dozen patents, had a genetic weakness for invention. As students at Purdue, her Irish-born father, Miles O'Brien, and his identical twin brother, Richard, had invented the South Bend lathe, an ingenious device that proved so useful for grinding automobile gears and the like that the brothers made a fortune turning them out in a factory in South Bend.         Mrs. Donovan also benefited directly from her father's ingenuity. When her mother died when she was 7, he offhandedly invented the take your-daughter-to-work movement. The Fort Wayne Lathe Works became little Marion O'Brien's after-school home and she grew up absorbed by complicated machinery.         At college, she majored in English literature, a parallel interest that had no doubt been sharpened when her father and uncle produced a little book, ''How to Operate a Lathe,'' in 1930 that sold 1.5 million copies in 78 countries.         In her quest for a dampless diaper, Mrs. Donovan was in the bathroom one day when the shower curtain caught her eye and a lightbulb went off in her head. Before you could say waterproof material, the curtain was missing a panel and Mrs. Donovan was up in the attic at her sewing machine. Three years and many shower curtains later she came up with the Boater, a re-usable diaper cover made of surplus nylon parachute cloth.         In addition to solving the soak-through diaper problem, Mrs. Donovan, made another major advance in diaper technology: replacing the optimistically named safety pins with plastic snaps.         The moisture-proof diaper covers were an immediate sensation when they went on sale at Saks Fifth Avenue in 1949. By the time her patents came through in 1951, she had sold their rights for $1 million and moved on to her next brainstorm: replacing cloth diapers with disposable absorbent paper.         As a striking woman who was forever being likened to Myrna Loy when she wasn't being likened to Rosalind Russell, Mrs. Donovan had no trouble getting in to see top executives of leading paper companies. But when they heard her idea, they laughed. As a result, it was a decade before a grandfather named Victor Mills completed her mother's work and perfected Pampers, the first mass-produced disposable diaper.         By then Mrs. Donovan's diaper days were over, but her inventing days were just beginning. When it came to finding inspired solutions to mundane problems, she was incorrigible. She reacted to an overstuffed closet, for example, by inventing the Big Hangup, a hanger that could accommodate 30 skirts or slacks in a compact space, and she solved the affront of rancid, semi-congealed soap festering in the bottom of a soap dish by inventing a wire soap holder that attached to the overflow opening and drained directly into the basin.         She got so wound up she even reinvented herself. She obtained an architecture degree from Yale at 41 in 1958. Then, after working with a Fairfield firm and designing her own house in Greenwich, she returned to inventions, including Zippity-Do, an elasticized zipper pull that allowed a woman to zip up the back of a dress by pulling down from the front.         When she saw her second husband, John F. Butler, flossing his teeth one day, she realized how painful and ungainly it was to wrap the ends of a length of dental floss tightly around one's index fingers to pull it taut. So she solved the purple finger problem by inventing Dentaloop, individual precut circles of two-ply dental floss that could be manipulated like a cat's cradle without cutting off digital circulation.         Mr. Butler died in July.         She is survived by two daughters, Christine Donovan of Manhattan and Sharon Dodd of New Orleans; a son, Dr. James F. Donovan Jr. of Oklahoma City, and three grandchildren.       
         Helen Herrick Malsed, a lumber baron's daughter whose imagination gave rise to the popular Slinky Dog and Slinky Train toys, died Nov. 13 in Seattle, her home for almost 60 years. She was 88.         She created more than 26 toys or games, including the first board game based on Roman numerals, said Fredrick Malsed, her son.         Among her other inventions, Mr. Malsed said, were large, irregular-shaped interlocking beads sold as ''jewelry'' for children. But unlike the tiny pieces they replaced, hers were made too big to fit in an infant's mouth, to eliminate the risk of choking. She sold that idea to a major toy manufacturer in 1958 for $5,000.         By then, her son said, Mrs. Malsed was collecting royalties of $60,000 to $70,000 annually. The checks continued for the 17 years of her patent for the idea that she proposed to the company that made Slinky.         That company is James Industries of Hollidaysburg, Pa., the inventor and manufacturer of the original, unadorned Slinky, a coiled 80-foot-long steel wire equally capable of somersaulting gracefully down steps or ending up at the foot of the steps in a maddening tangle.         Invented in 1944 by Richard James, an engineer who worked at a Philadelphia shipyard, where he observed a torsion spring fall from a table, the toy was named by his wife, Betty, and the following year the sinuous Slinky was on its way to sales of an estimated 250 million. Eventually a Slinky wound up under the Malsed Christmas tree, where according to family legend, 6-year-old Fredrick thought to ask, ''I wonder what this could do with wheels?''         ''My mother had always listened carefully to children,'' Mr. Malsed said, ''so she immediately got father to go to the basement, take the wheels off another toy and try to solder them on a Slinky spring.''         Not long after, Richard T. James 2d said, ''Mrs. Malsed sent us a letter and some drawings, suggesting we put the Slinky in the body of a pull-toy, and we liked the idea.'' While Mrs. Malsed and James Industries maintained ''a very nice relationship'' even after her patent expired, Mr. James said, he did not remember her ever visiting the factory.         Mrs. Malsed invented pull-toys for other manufacturers, but none as popular as those for Slinky.         Born in Cincinnati, Mrs. Malsed spent her first 16 years in St. Maries, Idaho, before moving to Spokane, Wash., with her family. Her father, Fred Herrick, had lumber operations in seven states from Washington to Florida, Mr. Malsed said, and traveled to the sites in his private railroad car. But he lost $12 million in the Depression, and his daughter Helen was forced to drop out of Whitman College in Walla Walla, Wash.         After studying advertising in San Francisco, she was offered a job at the Frederick & Nelson department store in Seattle, where she met and married Marion Parker Malsed, who sold men's clothing in the store.         Mrs. Malsed's husband died in 1973. In addition to her son, also of Seattle, she is survived by her sisters, Catherine Chastek of Spokane and Fredrica Adams of Seattle, and two grandchildren.       
         Florence L. Walsh, a fast-rising executive at Lucent Technologies Inc. who helped engineer that company's split from the AT&T Corporation in 1996, died on Saturday at Morristown Memorial Hospital in New Jersey. Ms. Walsh, who lived in Bernardsville, N.J., was 37.         The cause was toxic shock syndrome resulting from an infection during pregnancy, a Lucent spokeswoman said. The infection also caused the death of Ms. Walsh's unborn son on Oct. 31.         Ms. Walsh, who was known as Meg, was vice president and treasurer of Lucent, one of the world's biggest makers of advanced communications equipment. While reporting to the company's chief financial officer, Ms. Walsh managed Lucent's  $35 billion pension fund and the company's lending and borrowing.         She demonstrated acumen in her relationship with financial markets. Earlier this year, she raised about $300 million for Lucent by issuing 30-year bonds that paid the lowest effective interest rate on such bonds issued by a company with Lucent's credit rating in almost 30 years, according to Securities Data, which tracks bond offerings.         Ms. Walsh graduated from Johns Hopkins University in 1984 and from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1988. After leaving Wharton, Ms. Walsh joined the General Motors Corporation in New York City, rising to director for corporate finance and capital markets.         She joined AT&T in 1994 as assistant treasurer. In that job, she helped establish the financial framework for Lucent's split from AT&T. She joined Lucent as treasurer a few months before the companies formally separated.         Ms. Walsh is survived by her husband, Mark; a son, Carter; her parents, Mollie Bucy of Baltimore and David Long of Crownsville, Md.; a brother, David Long Jr. of St. Petersburg, Fla., and her maternal grandparents, Robert and Florence Roy of Ruxton, Md.       
         Anita Kurman Gulkin, president and chief executive of Greenwich House Inc., a social-service and cultural community organization based in Greenwich Village, died on Sunday at Beth Israel Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 59, lived in Springfield, N.J., and also had an apartment in Chelsea in Manhattan.         The cause was a heart attack during hip surgery last Friday, and she also had cancer, said Paul Racioppi, Greenwich House's chief development officer. She went to work as usual the day before the surgery.         Ms. Gulkin, a former specialist in programs for drug abusers, became Greenwich House's executive director in 1976. Her title was changed to president and chief executive in 1991.         The multifaceted organization has its headquarters at 27 Barrow Street, employs 250 people and also carries on its programs at seven other sites in and near Greenwich Village. In her 22 years as its senior salaried executive, its annual operating budget grew to $13.5 million from $1 million or less, Mr. Racioppi said.         In the years since 1986, Ms. Gulkin set into motion new Greenwich House programs for recovering alcoholics, other substance abusers and people with H.I.V. or AIDS, as well as for providing music and fine-arts classes in public elementary schools, for treating abused children and preventing child abuse and for serving hot meals for elderly Greenwich Villagers to eat together.         She joined Greenwich House's staff as a supervisor of its programs for drug abusers in 1968 and was made director of its substance abuse clinics in 1972.         Over the years, she was also active in other Manhattan social-service organizations. At her death, she was chairwoman of Caring Community, which administers programs for the elderly, mainly in Greenwich Village, and the West Side Association of Community Centers. She was also a co-founder and a former member of the board of what is now called Urban Pathways.         She was inducted into Greenwich Village's Hall of Fame and received the United Way's Big Apple Award.         A native of Newark, she received a bachelor's degree from Pennsylvania State University and later studied social work at Columbia.         She is survived by her husband, Sam Gulkin; a brother, Dr. Martin Kurman of Manhattan, and a sister, Bernice Winarsky of Springfield.       
         Virginia Graham, who went from writing radio soap operas in the 1940's to becoming one of the most successful and enduring of the early television talk show hosts, died on Tuesday in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit of New York Hospital in Manhattan. She was 86 and lived in Manhattan.         Starting in the 1950's when she succeeded Margaret Truman as hostess of NBC Radio's ''Weekday'' series, in which she was teamed with Mike Wallace, she quickly became known for her spontaneity, irreverence and her ability to get good interviews from those who appeared on her shows.         ''From the first second I went on the air, I have been easy to communicate with,'' she said in 1965. For two decades, she presided over television talk shows including ''Food for Thought'' from 1956 to 1961; ''Girl Talk'' (1963-69); and ''The Virginia Graham Show''(1970-72).         ''Girl Talk'' was enormously successful. In its heyday it drew an average audience of 2 million who tuned in five days a week to watch Miss Graham interview the most celebrated women of the day, including Olivia de Havilland, Pearl S. Buck, Gloria Swanson, Louise Rainer, Ilka Chase, Cornelia Otis Skinner, Marian Javits, Hermione Gingold, Barbara Walters, Phyllis Diller and Joan Rivers.         In the early days of television, she was also seen frequently on Jack Paar's ''Tonight'' show, and occasionally served as a substitute host on 'Strike It Rich'' and ''The Big Payoff.'' She also appeared on the ''Roseanne,'' ''Rosie O'Donnell'' and ''Tom Snyder'' shows.         She was also active in charity work, raising many millions for the American Cancer Society (she survived cervical cancer in the 1950's and spoke of it widely and often) as well as the foundations set up to research cerebral palsy, multiple sclerosis and kidney disease.         Miss Graham's husband, Harry Guttenberg, who ran a well-known theatrical costume company, died of kidney disease in 1980. She wrote about her experience in ''Life After Harry: My Adventures in Widowhood,'' which became a best seller.         Miss Graham was born on July 4, 1912, in Chicago, the daughter of David S. Komiss, a women's clothier, and the former Bessie J. Feiges.         She attended the University of Chicago, where she majored in anthropology and received a Phi Beta Kappa key. She then studied journalism at Northwestern University, and received a master's degree.         In the years that followed, she worked as a photographer's model and in 1934 did some fashion reporting for radio station WBBM in Chicago. In the 1930's she wrote scripts for commercials used on WMCA, a New York radio station.         After World War II, she contributed scripts for such radio soaps as ''Stella Dallas,'' ''Our Gal Sunday'' and ''Backstage Wife.''         In addition to her work in television, she appeared on the stage, including a Chicago production of Neil Simon's ''Barefoot in the Park.''         She wrote several books, the last of which, ''I Love Antiques but I Don't Want to Be One,'' is scheduled to be published next fall by Crown.         Miss Graham is survived by a daughter, Lynn Bohrer, and a granddaughter, Jan, both of New York; and a grandson, Stephen, of Singapore.       
         Gyo Fujikawa, a prolific author and illustrator of children's books, including some of the first to feature children of many races, died on Nov. 26 at New York Hospital. She was 90 and lived in Manhattan.         The California-born daughter of a Japanese farmer and an aspiring Japanese social worker, Miss Fujikawa was among the first illustrators to command royalties rather than a flat fee.         Miss Fujikawa's father borrowed her first name from a Chinese emperor (the name rhymes with Leo).         She illustrated five books, including ''Mother Goose'' and ''The Night Before Christmas,'' and wrote and illustrated 45 others. She also designed six United States postage stamps, including the 32-cent yellow rose self-adhesive stamp issued last year and the United States-Japan Treaty centenary stamp of 1960.         Although she retired from writing and illustrating books in 1990, when  her last two books were published, Barnes and Noble booksellers had recently approached her longtime literary agent about reprinting many of the ones that are out of print, said the agent, Bernard Kurman. The first two books she both wrote and illustrated, ''Babies'' and ''Baby Animals,'' have sold a combined 1.3 million copies and are still in print.         ''If you notice,'' Miss Fujikawa wrote a few years ago, ''in all my books (except for the fairy-tale books) there are very few grown-ups. I try to draw children in such a way that they convey the emotion or the action or whatever it is that I'm talking about.''         Born in Berkeley, Calif., in 1908, Miss Fujikawa studied at the Chouinard Art Institute in Los Angeles before and after spending 1932 in Japan, where she developed a love of Japanese art and a stronger appreciation of her heritage. Back home, she did promotional work on the movie ''Fantasia'' for Disney Studios, which later sent her to its advertising department in New York, where she designed many 25-cent Disney books.         After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor during World War II, Mrs. Fujikawa's family was interned in Arkansas in a relocation camp.         During the war Miss Fujikawa did movie and pharmaceutical advertising layouts and magazine illustrations.         After she did a composite of Disney characters for McCall's magazine, Doris Dunewald, an editor at Grosset & Dunlap, asked her to illustrate a new edition of Robert Louis Stevenson's ''A Child's Garden of Verses,'' which was published in 1953. A few years later Ms. Dunewald proposed that she write the text as well as illustrate the two books that became ''Babies'' and ''Baby Animals.'' After that Miss Fujikawa was to write and illustrate most of her books, including the last two, ''See What I Can Be!'' (Putnam, 1990) and ''Good Night, Sleep Tight, Shhh. . .'' (Random House, 1990).         Although she was engaged for a few years beginning at the age of 19, Miss Fujikawa never married. In her autobiographical sketch, written in her later years, she said, ''I am flattered when people ask me how I know so much about how children think and feel. Although I have never had children of my own, and cannot say I had a particularly marvelous childhood, perhaps I can say I am still like a child myself. Part of me, I guess, never grew up.''       
         Hazel Bishop, who cooked up the first kissproof lipstick (''stays on you . . . not on him'') in a kitchen fitted out as a laboratory, then lost the right to use the name she made famous, died on Saturday at the Osborn Home in Rye, N.Y. She was 92.         She exploited the skills of a research chemist, a merchant and a teacher to achieve eminence in three careers over the course of 50 years.         It was soon after World War II that Miss Bishop, a trained chemist who had worked in a dermatologist's laboratory, developed a nondrying, nonirritating, long-wearing lipstick. (Long-lasting types contain high amounts of colorants called bromo acids that have staining qualities.)         In 1950, she formed Hazel Bishop Inc. to manufacture and market her discovery. ''Never again need you be embarrassed by smearing friends, children, relatives, husband, sweetheart,'' the early advertising said, pointing out that older formulations tended to leave greasy marks on glasses, cigarettes and teeth. And the new brand did not have to be applied several times a day.         The brand found instant acceptance. When it was introduced that summer at $1 a tube, Lord & Taylor sold out its stock on the first day. The brand soon captured 25 percent of the fast-growing lipstick market and locked horns with Charles Revson of Revlon in ''the lipstick war.''         But Miss Bishop was engaged in a war of her own with her majority stockholder over financial issues. In settling her lawsuit, she left the company in 1954, when its sales exceeded $10 million a year. She set up Hazel Bishop Laboratories to develop household and personal care products, but ran into legal problems with her former partner, losing the right to sell products under her own name or to use it in personal appearances.         In 1962, she became a stockbroker for Bache & Company and later a financial analyst for Evans & Company. With the burgeoning of the fragrance business in the 1960's and 70's, cosmetics companies became hot stocks and her advice was ardently sought. She was quoted in newspaper financial pages and lectured throughout the United States.         Her third career was in fashion education. In 1978, she became an adjunct professor at the Fashion Institute of Technology in Manhattan in a program preparing young people for careers in cosmetics.         In 1980, on the occasion of Miss Bishop's appointment to the Revlon Chair in Cosmetics Marketing at F.I.T., Michel Bergerac, chairman of Revlon, said: ''It is really quite an achievement to carve one outstanding career in a lifetime. To succeed in business, in finance, and in academics in only part of a life is truly an amazing thing.''         Hazel Bishop was born in Hoboken, N.J.. on Aug. 17, 1906, one of two children of Henry and Mabel Bishop. Her father ran a dozen successful enterprises, including numerous stores on Washington Street, the main concourse of Hoboken. One Thanksgiving, he brought Santa Claus to town on an elephant to advertise his candy emporium.         ''The family talk around the dinner table always concerned business,'' Miss Bishop said.         After graduating from Barnard College, Miss Bishop intended to go to medical school, but the stock market crash forced her to take a job as a chemist at Columbia University Medical Center, where she worked for a leading dermatologist, investigating allergies and cosmetics.         In World War II, as senior organic chemist with what is now Exxon, she discovered the cause of deposits affecting superchargers of aircraft engines. After the war, she moved on to what is now Mobil, but in the meantime made her historic discovery.         She is survived by a niece, Randa Bishop of Las Vegas, Nev., and two nephews, Arthur Lipper of Delmar, Calif., and A. Michael Lipper of Summit, N.J.         Described over the years as demure and trim, with hazel eyes and a weakness for hats, the woman who invented kissable lipstick never married. She said she felt the obligation, in her courting years, to keep her widowed mother company at home.         After she left the business, she still mixed up lipstick for herself, a red shade with a blue cast, and once offered the following beauty advice: ''Women should use makeup to accentuate their most attractive feature. After the age of 25 or thereabouts, personality becomes an increasingly more attractive feature.''       
         Judith Arron, the executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall since 1986, died on Friday at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in Denver. She was 56 and lived in Chappaqua, N.Y.         The cause was breast cancer, Carnegie Hall officials said yesterday.         Ms. Arron presided over probably the most momentous years of Carnegie Hall since its rescue from the wrecking ball in 1960. The exhaustive $60 million renovation of the hall in 1986 happened on her watch, as well as the seasonlong and highly festive centennial celebration of 1990-91.         Ms. Arron used the refurbishment of Carnegie Hall's smaller Weill Recital Hall as an opportunity to transform it from a rental space to an important venue for events produced by the Hall. They included debut series, chamber music events, jazz concerts and a new music series administered by the Carnegie Hall Composer's Chair, which is currently held by Ellen Taaffe Zwilich.         Under Ms. Arron, the Hall promoted and extended educational programs, with workshops overseen by musicians like Robert Shaw and Pierre Boulez. In partnership with the Hall's president, the violinist Isaac Stern, and its chairman, Sanford Weill, Ms. Arron began an endowment campaign in 1995 and had raised $87 million to date.         Ms. Arron came to Carnegie Hall from Cincinnati, where she was the Cincinnati Symphony's manager and the director of its May Festival. Her work in developing educational programs there in 1969 was admired in orchestra circles. Before that, Ms. Arron had worked for the American Symphony Orchestra League and a Government arts program.         Ms. Arron was born in Seattle and graduated from the University of Puget Sound with a performance degree in cello and piano. Her husband, Ronald D. Arron, is a violinist with the Met Orchestra.         Mr. Stern said yesterday that Ms. Arron's health in the last two weeks had been ''touch and go'' but that her eight-and-a-half-year battle with cancer had been ''a miracle'' and a victory of ''will and heart over doctors and medicine.''         At her death, Ms. Arron was preparing to bring yet another performing space to Carnegie Hall, a below-ground area long occupied by the Carnegie Hall Cinema to be equipped with high-tech appurtenances and intended for smaller opera productions and experimental work.         Ms. Arron is survived, in addition to her husband, by two sons, Joseph and Edward of Manhattan; her parents, Richard and Berenice Hagerty La Quinta, Calif.; a sister, Colleen Fretz of Belize, and two brothers, Richard Hagerty Jr. of Modesto, Calif., and Dale Hagerty also of La Quinta.         Correction:  December 25, 1998, Friday  An obituary on Monday, and in some copies on Sunday, about Judith Arron, the executive and artistic director of Carnegie Hall, misstated the position of her husband, Ronald D. Arron, in the Metropolitan Opera  Orchestra. He is a violist, not a violinist.
