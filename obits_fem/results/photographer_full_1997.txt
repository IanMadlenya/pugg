         Ella Maillart, a Swiss sportswoman, adventurer, travel writer and photographer who defied convention, hardship and international borders to explore forbidden territory and forbidding terrain, died on Thursday in her mountain chalet in Chandolin, Switzerland. She was 94.         She was the author of ''Forbidden Journey,'' an account of her 1935 trek to the closed city of Sinkiang in Chinese Turkestan.         During a life in which she was variously a French teacher in Wales, a secretary, a traveling saleswoman, an Olympic sailer, a competitive skier, a pioneer field hockey player, an actress, a sculptor's model and a movie stuntwoman, Ms. Maillart seemed most comfortable on the frontiers of social convention and  Western civilization.         The daughter of a well-to-do Geneva furrier and his athletic Danish  wife, Ms. Maillart grew up rich and restless.         An accomplished athlete who founded Switzerland's first women's field hockey club and was a member of the Swiss sailing team in the 1924 Olympics, Ms. Maillart was initially drawn to the sea.         She was a familiar figure on the Mediterranean in the 1920's and 30's and became something of a sensation in England after the commander of the British Mediterranean Fleet received an official reprimand because the entire fleet missed lights out while the Admiral entertained Ms. Maillart and three other yachtswomen.         She had to abandon a plan to sail the South Pacific with an all-female crew when her childhood sailing companion fell ill.         Instead, after a brief film career in Berlin in 1930, she went to Moscow, then walked across the Caucasus Mountains, tried to put together a women's field hockey team in Russia and rowed for a team called the Alimentation Workers' Eight.         A 1932 trip to Russian Turkestan whetted her appetite for Asian travel. An introduction to a Paris publisher by a noted yachtsman she had met on the Riviera helped her combine her wanderlust with professional purpose and led to two books, ''Turkestan Solo'' and ''Among Russian Youth: From Moscow to the Caucasus.''         In a 1993 interview with MarBy Blume in The International Herald Tribune, Ms. Maillart attributed her yearning for travel to her disgust with the horrors of World War I.         ''I wanted to leave Europe,'' she said, ''go as far as possible.''         Ms. Maillart, whose travel credo was ''Nobody can go? Then I shall go,'' was so determined to go where few Western men and virtually no women had gone before that she was willing to endure almost any hardship.         For her most famous journey, a harrowing 7-month, 3,500-mile trek from Beijing to Kashmir through  Chinese Turkestan in 1935, she set off with two pounds of marmalade, a  rifle, a bottle of Worcestershire  sauce, writing paper, a Leica camera and an unwieldy companion -- Peter Fleming, a Times of London correspondent and Ian Fleming's younger brother.         Both would have preferred to travel alone, but Ms. Maillart, knowing that foreigners were barred from the warlord-controlled territory, decided it might not be a bad idea to have a companion along in case she landed in prison.         Mr. Fleming, an acknowledged travel amateur, got the better part of the bargain: a companion who could design and make a tent, cook outdoors in freezing winds, sew and walk 14 miles without eating, and, as it happened, who was willing to wash his clothes as well as hers.         Or as he put it in his account of the journey, ''News Tartary,'' ''It was she, and not I, who did the dirty work.''         In the inevitable comparisons of their separate accounts of the journey, Mr. Fleming was considered the more elegant writer.         Ms. Maillart's book, a straightforward, workmanlike account of exactly what she saw, was written for the ages. In a thousand years, for example, her description of a child and newborn lambs on a yurt floor thick with their droppings will remain as authoritative an account of what things were like in Turkestan in 1935 as her photographs. Taken as notes, not as art, they were featured in a 1993 Paris exhibition.         Ms. Maillart, who often traveled alone -- on foot, on horseback, or by camel -- made another concession for a 1947 trek with a sick, morphine-addicted friend. She called the resulting book ''The Cruel Way: Two Women and a Ford in Afghanistan.''         Ms. Maillart, who leaves no immediate survivors, continued to travel, largely for her own amusement. But in recent years she cut back on her travels: She made her last trip to Tibet when she was 83 and had not traveled abroad since a visit to Goa three years ago.       
         LaVern Baker, one of the most important rhythm-and-blues singers of the 1950's, died on Monday at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in Manhattan. She was 67.         The cause was heart complications, The Associated Press said.         Ms. Baker was a mainstay of the Atlantic Records roster of the mid-1950's, applying the fervor of gospel and the bluesy power of Bessie Smith to songs about love and lust like ''Tweedlee Dee.'' Her string of hits ended by the mid-1960's, but in the late 1980's she made a comeback, appearing on Broadway in ''Black and Blue'' and recording new albums.         Ms. Baker, whose original name was Delores Williams, was born in Chicago; an aunt was the blues singer Memphis Minnie. Ms. Baker sang gospel in church, and in the mid-1940's she worked as a blues singer, calling herself Little Miss Sharecropper and Bea Baker.         She could growl the blues or sing with sweet playfulness, and the big-band leader Fletcher Henderson convinced OKeh Records to sign her. She recorded jazz-tinged songs for OKeh and then rhythm-and-blues for King Records without much impact. But in 1953, she was signed to Atlantic Records.         Her second session for the label yielded ''Tweedlee Dee,'' which its producer, Jerry Wexler, called ''a soulful nursery jingle''; it had originally been intended as the B-side of a single. It reached No. 14 on the pop chart in 1954 and eventually sold a million copies. But in that segregated era, a version recorded with the same musicians by a white singer, Georgia Gibbs, reached No. 2. Ms. Baker estimated that she had lost $15,000 in royalties and wrote her Congressman to protest, receiving only campaign material in return.         But through the 1950's, she was a consistent hit maker. She performed in ''Rock, Rock, Rock!,'' a 1956 movie with the disk jockey Alan Freed. ''Jim Dandy,'' released in 1957, sold a million copies; other rhythm-and-blues hits included ''Bop Ting-a-Ling,'' ''Play It Fair,'' ''Jim Dandy Got Married'' and ''Voodoo Voodoo.'' She recorded an album of Bessie Smith songs in 1958. In 1959, the ballad ''I Cried a Tear'' reached No.  6 on the pop chart, and in the early 1960's Ms. Baker had minor hits including ''Shake a Hand,'' ''See See Rider'' and ''Saved.''         She switched to Brunswick Records in 1963, where she recorded standards like ''Fly Me to the Moon.'' In 1969, she developed pneumonia while entertaining troops in Vietnam, and went to the Philippines for treatment. She stayed there for nearly two decades, running a nightclub in Subic Bay. But in 1988, she performed at Madison Square Garden at a 40th-anniversary concert for Atlantic Records, and was rediscovered. She replaced Ruth Brown in the Broadway revue ''Black and Blue.'' In 1990, she received a career achievement award from the Rhythm-and-Blues Foundation and in 1991 she was inducted into the Rock-and-Roll Hall of Fame. Her Atlantic hits were reissued, and she made new albums for the DRG label in 1991 and 1992.         Ms. Baker had a stroke in the early 1990's, and complications from diabetes forced her to have her legs amputated in 1995. But she returned to performing in 1996 with an undiminished voice and an indomitable spirit.         Correction:  March 14, 1997, Friday         A picture credit on Wednesday with an obituary of the rhythm-and-blues singer LaVern Baker misspelled the surname of the photographer and misstated the date. The photographer was Jack Vartoogian, not Vatoogian. The picture was taken in 1996, not 1966.       
         Dorothy Norman, a photographer, writer, editor, arts patron and advocate for social change, died yesterday at her home in East Hampton, L.I. She was 92 and also had a home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan.         Born Dorothy Stecker in Philadelphia in 1905, Mrs. Norman grew up in a well-to-do family. She spoke French and German, heard her first opera when she was 10, discovered art at the Barnes Collection and despite the comforts of her life, developed an early sense of social injustice.         She attended Smith College and then the University of Pennsylvania from 1922 to 1925, the year she married Edward A. Norman, the son of a founder of Sears Roebuck. They settled in New York City, where Mrs. Norman was a researcher at the American Civil Liberties Union, became involved with the early Planned Parenthood Association and was one of the first supporters of the Group Theater. As she later put it, her life developed around both a desire ''to advance both art and action'' and an interest in people actively involved with either.         In the art world, Mrs. Norman was best known for her close relationship with the photographer Alfred Stieglitz, whom she met in 1927 when she wandered into his art gallery, the Intimate Gallery on Park Avenue.         Stieglitz became her lover and mentor, encouraging her longtime interest in taking photographs. Mrs. Norman became the subject of many of his photographs and a crucial force in his third and final gallery, An American Place, which he opened in 1932 with her encouragement and money she raised from family and friends.         Arriving every day after lunch, Mrs. Norman oversaw most of the gallery's workings, while also recording many of her conversations with Stieglitz. These notes became the basis of her 1973 book, the first full-length biography of the photographer, ''Alfred Stieglitz: An American Seer''.         While hardly free of Stieglitz's influence, Mrs. Norman's photographs have a voice of their own. Concise and beautifully composed and lighted, they include some of the last images of Stieglitz and his gallery, as well as portraits of other people she was close to, among them Lewis Mumford, Theodore Dreiser, John Cage, Jawaharlal Nehru and his daughter, Indira Gandhi. Failing eyesight forced Mrs. Norman to give up photography in the late 1950's.         During the late 1930's and 40's, Mrs. Norman, along with her husband, became well known for supporting liberal causes at home and abroad, including independence for India and Israel, civil rights and education. She was a founding member of New York's Liberal Party, was a member of the Americans for Democratic Action and served on the boards of the New York Urban League and the National Urban League. In the 1950's, she was a founder and chairwoman of the American Emergency Food Committee for India and The American Citizens' Committee for Economic Aid Abroad.         An intense yet restrained woman, Mrs. Norman was adept at mixing people and objects from different spheres. Her International Style town house on East 70th Street, designed by the Swiss architect William Lescaze in the early 1940's, was, in the decades after World War II, a place were one might meet Aaron Copland, Ralph Ellison, John Marin, Harold Clurman, Allen Ginsberg or the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. The objects in her spacious parlor-floor living room were equally eclectic: works by Stieglitz, pre-Columbian and Asian statues, and striking shells and fossils.         A seemingly tireless worker, Mrs. Norman wrote a weekly column in The New York Post titled ''A World to Live In'' from 1942 to 1949. For 10 years starting in 1938, she edited and published ''Twice a Year,'' a journal of literature, the arts and civil liberties whose contributors included Richard Wright, Albert Camus, Jean-Paul Sartre and Bertolt Brecht. Among the other books she wrote or edited were ''The Selected Writings of John Marin'' (1949); ''Indira Gandhi: Letters to an American Friend'' (1985) and ''Encounters: a Memoir'' (1987). In 1965 she published ''Nehru: The First Sixty Years,'' a two-volume collection of the Indian leader's writings.         In 1968, Mrs. Norman gave a large collection of photographs to the Philadelphia Museum of Art. Her photographs are in the Museum of Modern Art, the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu, Calif.         Mrs. Norman's marriage ended in divorce in 1951. She is survived by a daughter, Nancy Lassalle of Manhattan, who is vice president of the School of American Ballet; a son, Andrew E. Norman of Palisades, N.Y.; seven grandchildren and six great-grandchildren.       
         Dorothy Norman, a photographer, writer, editor, arts patron and advocate for social change, died Saturday at her home in East Hampton, L.I.

         Helen Merrill, a strong-willed and influential theatrical agent who advanced the careers of many of the most imaginative playwrights, directors and designers in the American theater, died on Monday at St. Vincent's Hospital. She was 79 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was lung cancer, said Patrick Herold, who is a partner in her agency.         Ms. Merrill's strength was in finding and encouraging venturesome young artists. As an agent, she played an important role in the lives of the playwrights Christopher Durang, Albert Innaurato, Richard Greenberg, Paul Rudnick and David Henry Hwang, among others. The designers she represented included Ming Cho Lee, George Tsypin, Tony Straiges, Paul Gallo and William Ivey Long, and among her directors were Anne Bogart, Jerry Zaks, Christopher Ashley, Michael Greif and Lisa Peterson.         Not all these people remained her clients, but they generally continued to feel a great indebtedness. Mr. Greenberg, who subsequently moved on to another agency, said: ''Helen ushered in a generation of playwrights. She was tremendously important to the life of the New York theater.''         Outspoken and demanding, she was known for her unassailable belief in her clients, whom she would support economically as well as artistically, often lending them money, while urging them to challenge themselves.         Although she lived in New York City for almost 60 years, she never lost her heavy German accent, which became a distinguishing feature of her personality, along with her wry and often prankish sense of humor. Her clients affectionately imitated her accent and mannerisms.         Mr. Rudnick used her as the model for the actor's agent played by Celeste Holm in his play ''I Hate Hamlet.'' He said: ''She was known for her independence, her passionate devotion to theater and her carefully honed mystique. She loved to discover and nurture talent with a trademark combination of toughness and glee.''         While other agents might sit in offices waiting for scripts, Ms. Merrill was indefatigable in her search for new plays. Dressed in her characteristic uniform (Brooks Brothers striped button-down shirt, Gap khakis and tennis shoes, and, in winter, a full-length mink coat), she was a familiar figure on the outposts of Off Off Broadway, always on the alert for emerging artists.         In the case of Mr. Durang, she first saw his work at the Yale Repertory Theater, where he and Mr. Innaurato collaborated on the satiric musical ''The Idiot's Karamazov.'' Soon she was trekking to see Mr. Durang's comedies in late-night performances at small Manhattan theaters. Later, as his agent, she was instrumental in enlisting three regional theaters to offer sequential productions of his play ''A History of the American Film'' and then shepherded it to Broadway.         ''She was the opposite of the cliches about agents,'' Mr. Durang said. ''If you had an offer of a lot of money or a workshop at Playwrights Horizons, she would much prefer that you did the workshop.''         About her taste, he said, ''She liked plays on the edge, and would get restless with old-fashioned playwrights.''         Most of her writers were several generations younger than she was. Many became her friends, though even for them she retained an air of mystery. ''I thought she led many other lives and was opaque about telling us about them,'' Mr. Durang said. There had been a brief marriage, and there was her intense relationship with Anthony Perkins, with whom she shared a home for many years.         Her representation of scenic, costume, lighting and sound designers added an entirely new dimension to her career.         ''She was a major person in representing designers,'' said Ming Cho Lee. ''We all went to Helen.''         After Mr. Lee joined her agency, many of his design students at the Yale Graduate School of Drama followed. Immersing herself in the world of design, she became an indispensable ally to Mr. Lee and others.         ''Her ideas never aged,'' Mr. Lee said. ''She was opinionated, but her opinions mattered. She could discriminate between fashion and something with a real core. In terms of the art of theater, we don't have anyone else.''         Ms. Merrill was born in Cologne, Germany, and came to the United States in 1939 with her parents and sister. She is survived by her sister, Anjelica Wender of Manhattan, and her brother, Hervey, of Rochester.         Although Ms. Merrill was primarily known as an agent, it was actually her third career. Earlier she had been a theatrical photographer. Then, with the backing of Mr. Perkins, she ran the Osgood Gallery in Manhattan. When the art gallery failed, she reinvented herself as an agent. In 1973, she opened Helen Merrill Ltd., specializing in playwrights and designers while also continuing to represent literary clients.         ''She was perhaps the first play agent to realize the importance of the new nonprofit theater movement,'' said Andre Bishop, co-director of Lincoln Center Theater, and before that the head of Playwrights Horizons. ''She saw the future before others did, and she saw no difference between a 12-performance showcase and Broadway.''         Mr. Bishop said that for a single play at Playwrights Horizons, Ms. Merrill would sometimes represent the playwright, the director and all three designers. ''It could have been called Helen Merrill Horizons in those days,'' he said.       
         Connie Clausen, an actress and literary agent who began her career by riding circus elephants, died on Sept. 7 at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan. She was 74 and lived in Manhattan.         The cause was a stroke, said Stedman Mays, an associate of Ms. Clausen's literary agency.         Ms. Clausen's career began in the 1940's when she rode atop elephants for the Ringling Brothers and Barnum & Bailey Circus, providing the material for her memoir, ''I Love You Honey, but the Season's Over.'' After leaving the circus, she went to work at M-G-M studios in Hollywood, rising from messenger to director of special promotions.         In New York, she landed several roles on Broadway and television before becoming a publicity agent for Macmillan publishing in the 1970's. She helped publicize two of the company's international best-sellers, ''Watership Down'' and ''Jonathan Livingston Seagull,'' and in 1973 was made an assistant vice president.         She left Macmillan in 1976 to start her own agency, Connie Clausen & Associates, which was a pioneer in the so-called beauty book, beginning with a series of best sellers by the photographer Francesco Scavullo. Other successful categories for Ms. Clausen were memoirs and biographies, including the Pulitzer Prize-winning ''Jackson Pollock: An American Saga,'' by Steven Naifeh and Gregory Smith, and Quentin Crisp's ''Resident Alien: The New York Diaries.''         Ms. Clausen's three marriages ended in divorce. She is survived by a son, Michael Andersen of San Francisco; a brother, Harold, of Orlando, Fla., and a sister, Dolores Clausen Brockmeyer of Sarasota, Fla.
