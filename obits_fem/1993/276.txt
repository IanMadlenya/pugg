        Mary Luke, a biographer who wrote about Tudor and Elizabethan figures, died yesterday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. She was 74 and lived in Ridgefield, Conn.
        She died after a brief illness, her family said.
        Mrs. Luke wrote "Catherine, the Queen" (1967), a portrait of Henry VIII's hapless first wife, Catherine of Aragon. "A Crown for Elizabeth" (1970) limned the turbulent years between 1527, when Henry maneuvered for a divorce from Catherine for lack of a male heir, and 1558, when Elizabeth I ascended to the throne.
        In a review of "A Crown for Elizabeth" for The New York Times, Lady Antonia Fraser wrote, "To the sympathetic retelling of history, Mrs. Luke has made a notable contribution and one that will give much pleasure to its readers."
        "The Nine Days Queen: A Portrait of Lady Jane Grey" (1986) told the story of Jane Grey's brief hold on the scepter in July 1553 and her subsequent martyrdom. Mrs. Luke also wrote a novel, "The Nonsuch Lure" (1976), and "The Ivy Crown: A Biographical Novel of Queen Katherine Paar" (1984).
        Born in Pittsfield, Mass., Mrs. Luke, whose original name was Mary Munger, graduated from Berkshire Business School and worked in advertising in New York, and later for a documentary film company and RKO Studios in Hollywood.
        Mrs. Luke's marriage to the late David L. Luke Jr., a corporate executive, ended in divorce. She is survived by a daughter, Melinda C. Luke, also of Ridgefield; four brothers, John, Donald, Clifford and Raymond Munger, all of Pittsfield; two sisters, Dorothy Panzeri of Canaan, N.Y., and Ruth Durant of Pittsfield, and two granddaughters.
