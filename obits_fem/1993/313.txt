        Florence Bibo Alexander, a Manhattan agent for illustrators of children's books for many years, died on Tuesday at the New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 89.
        The cause was pneumonia, said a friend, Meredith Charpentier.
        Mrs. Alexander began her career in publishing in Philadelphia and later moved to Manhattan, where she entered the advertising business. She later set up her own agency, which represented artists and cartoonists.
        Joseph Alexander, whom she married in 1927, joined her in the agency.
