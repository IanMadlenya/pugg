        Dr. Kathrine Koller, a Renaissance scholar who became the first woman to head a department at the University of Rochester, died on Aug. 17 at a Rochester nursing home. Dr. Koller, a resident of Rochester, was 91.
        She had a long illness, the university reported.
        Dr. Koller, a gifted speaker who joined the Rochester faculty in 1942, was chairman of the English department from 1946 to 1958. Beyond her expertise in 17th-century English literature, she was known for her belief in the need of a firm footing in the humanities for young people to help them learn self-discipline and integrity.
        She was born in Hudson, N.Y., graduated Phi Beta Kappa from Wittenberg University and received a doctorate at Johns Hopkins University in 1932. She taught high school English in Ohio and was an assistant professor at Bryn Mawr College before she went to Rochester.
        There, she was named Joseph H. Gilmore Professor of English in 1948. Under her guidance, the English department nearly doubled its faculty to 20 members and instituted a Ph.D. program for future English teachers.
        Her articles on Renaissance literature appeared in scholarly journals. She reached emeritus status in 1967.
        In 1950, Dr. Koller married William Diez, professor of political science at Rochester. He died three years ago.
