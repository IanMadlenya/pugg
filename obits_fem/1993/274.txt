        Patricia Drylie, a dancer and an actress best known for her performance as a dancing waitress in the 1979 Michael Bennett musical "Ballroom," died on Nov. 11 at a nursing home in Brooklyn. She was 69 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was lung cancer, said Celia Tackaberry, a friend.
        Ms. Drylie was born and reared in Toronto. At 18, she left for New York City to join the Radio City Ballet as a soloist. In 1950, George Balanchine cast her in his revival of "On Your Toes," and she later danced in "My Fair Lady."
        She is survived by a sister, Margaret Bradley of Belleville, Ontario.
