        Ruth Bernice Schnurmacher, a New York philanthropist and benefactor of medical institutions, died on Monday at Lenox Hill Hospital. A resident of Manhattan, she was 83.
        Among her principal beneficiaries were the Albert Einstein College of Medicine and Beth Israel Medical Center, which named its Schnurmacher Nursing Home last year in recognition of the many years of support received from her and her husband of 61 years, Adolph. She was a member of the Society of Founders at Albert Einstein.
        The medical specialties in which she took an interest at those and other institutions included pediatrics, orthopedic surgery, cardiology, geriatric care, the treatment of AIDS patients and optometry.
        The State University of New York's College of Optometry in Manhattan named its Institute of Vision Research in the couple's honor.
        Mrs. Schnurmacher's husband survives her.
