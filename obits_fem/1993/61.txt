        Irene Claire Fromer, a retired teacher and artist, died on Tuesday at Doctors Hospital on Staten Island. She was 70 and lived on Staten Island and in St. Croix, V.I.
        Her death was a result of a myocardial flu virus, said her husband of nearly 50 years, Dr. Stephen Fromer.
        Mrs. Fromer, a graduate of Hunter College, earned a master's degree at Columbia University with a thesis on Herman Melville and the industrial revolution. She taught in the public schools and at one time worked for Merck & Company, writing abstracts on new drugs.
        She was an expert in Haitian art and had some of her own work -- paintings, collages and sculptures -- shown at several exhibitions. Together with her husband, she worked at Medical Consultants V.I. in St. Croix, advising doctors on office management.
        In addition to her husband, Mrs. Fromer is survived by a son, Dr. Carl H., of Staten Island; a daughter, Dr. Sandra A. Stingle of Manhattan; her mother, Bella Siegel of Staten Island; a brother, Jack Siegel of New Rochelle, N.Y., and two grandchildren.
