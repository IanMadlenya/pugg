        Margaret Nevil, a former state amateur golf champion, died on Thursday at Bassett Hospital in Cooperstown, N.Y. She was 72 and lived at Chestnut Park Farm in nearby Fly Creek.
        She died after a brief illness, said a representative for the Ingalls, Connell & Dow funeral home.
        She was a native of Yonkers and began golfing competitively at 13 years old, becoming known as an accomplished player in the 1930's under her maiden name, Margaret Nichols.
        Mrs. Nevil won the state women's amateur tournament four times in five years -- 1958, 1959, 1960 and 1962. In addition, she was Metropolitan New York junior champion, three-time champion of Westchester-Fairfield County and New York State senior women's champion.
        She graduated from Pine Manor Junior College in Wellesley, Mass., and from the Connecticut College for Women in New London.
        Mrs. Nevil is survived by her husband of 48 years, Harry J. Nevil Jr.; a daughter, Deborah L. of Scotia, N.Y.; two sons, Laurence F. of Saugerties, N.Y., and Robert M. of Chattanooga, Tenn.; a sister, Louise Starzenski of Galway, N.Y., and London; two brothers, Foster Nichols 3d of Brookville, N.Y., and Allen Nichols of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., and four granddaughters.
