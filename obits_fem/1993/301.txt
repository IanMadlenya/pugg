        Dolli Tingle Brackett, an artist and designer of Christmas stamps for the Postal Service, died on Dec. 11 in Norwalk Hospital, Norwalk, Conn. She was 82.
        The cause of death was respiratory failure, her son, Gordon Brackett, said.
        Mrs. Brackett lived in Westport, Conn., for 47 years, and also had a winter residence and studio in Sarasota, Fla. Known professionally as Dolli Tingle, she exhibited her oils and watercolors in many museums and galleries on the East Coast.
        In 1973, using needlepoint, she designed one of most popular stamps issued by the Postal Service, a depiction of a Christmas tree decorated with traditional ornaments, which drew upon memories of her childhood in Chicago. It took her 10 days to complete her needlepoint design using two strands of wool.
        For her work on the Christmas stamp she was voted Woman of the Year by the American Needlepoint Guild. In all, she designed eight Christmas stamps for the Postal Service.
        Mrs. Brackett, who studied at the Chicago Academy of Fire Arts, was also a painter who exhibited nationally, as well as a designer of books and rugs.
        She is survived by her husband of 53 years, Ward Brackett of Westport, a portrait painter who also designs stamps for the Postal Service, and her son, Gordon Brackett of Ridgefield, Conn.
