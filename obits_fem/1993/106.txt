        Maggie Hemingway, a British novelist, died on May 9, the British press reported late last week. She was 47 and lived in London and in Deal, a seaside resort near Dover.
        The cause was defective functioning of the blood-forming organs, The Daily Telegraph said.
        Ms. Hemingway won the Royal Society of Literature's Winifred Holtby Prize for her first novel, "The Bridge," which was published in Britain in 1986 and won critical praise there and in the United States.
        Reviewing Atheneum's American edition in February 1987 in The New York Times Book Review, Eden Ross Lipson, an editor of the Book Review, wrote, "If you like your tea and fiction delicately seasoned and served exquisitely, this novel may be a perfect midwinter cup."
        Ms. Hemingway was a distant relative of Ernest Hemingway, The Times of London said. She was born in Orford, in eastern Suffolk, studied at Edinburgh University and worked in publishing until "The Bridge" came out. Her other published novels are "Stop House Blues" (1988) and "The Postmen's House" (Trafalgar, 1992). She finished a fourth work of fiction, "Eyes," before she died.
        Ms. Hemingway was separated from her husband and is survived by two daughters.
