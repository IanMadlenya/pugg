        Ruth Gilbert, a stage actress discovered by Eugene O'Neill who went on to perform on television as Milton Berle's lovesick, scatterbrained secretary, Max, died on Tuesday at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 71 and lived in New York.
        The cause was brain cancer, said Dick Davis, a friend.
        Miss Gilbert, a graduate of the American Academy of Dramatic Arts, made her Broadway debut in "Girls in Uniform," in 1932. In 1933, she was cast by O'Neill in the role of Muriel in the Theater Guild production of "Ah, Wilderness!" starring George M. Cohan.
        O'Neill also cast her in "The Iceman Cometh" in 1946, as the young streetwalker, Pearl. Miss Gilbert, a member of the Group Theater for two years, also appeared as Sadie in John Howard Lawson's "Processional" at the Federal Theater Project in 1937. She also replaced Lee Grant as the shoplifter in the Broadway run of "Detective Story" in 1949. A Famous Line
        After a successful stint as a radio actress, she played the secretary on "The Milton Berle Show," and her repetitious plea, "Let's not fight this, Mil-l-ton, it's bigger than both of us," became a line repeated and laughed at across the country.
        In 1954, Miss Gilbert made headlines when she became pregnant and was dismissed from the program with no guarantee of reinstatement. The dispute was resolved and she returned to the program after she gave birth.
        In recent years, she performed in summer stock and acted on the stage and in television.
        She is survived by her husband, Emanuel Feinberg; a brother, Edward Gilbert; a daughter, Dr. Jaimy Honig, and two grandchildren, all of New York City.
        Correction:  October 22, 1993, Friday
        An obituary last Friday about the actress Ruth Gilbert misstated the place of her death. She had been a patient at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan, but she died at a hospice at Calvary Hospital in the Bronx.
