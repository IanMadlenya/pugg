        Betty Klarnet, who retired last year as managing editor of Harper's Bazaar magazine, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 75.
        She had suffered a long illness, said her daughter, Katy Klarnet.
        A native of New York City, Mrs. Klarnet attended Brooklyn College. She joined Woman's Day as an associate editor in 1950. She later filled leading editorial positions at Look, Family Circle, Family Health and American Home magazines and became managing editor of Harper's Bazaar in 1977.
        Besides her daughter, a resident of West Haven, Conn., Mrs. Klarnet is survived by two grandchildren.

        An obituary on Tuesday about Betty Klarnet, the retired managing editor of Harper's Bazaar magazine who died on Sept. 26, misstated the residence of her daughter, Katy Klarnet. She lives in West Hartford, Conn., not West Haven.
