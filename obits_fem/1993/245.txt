        Christine O'Reilly, one of the tennis-playing triplets from Ridgewood, N.J., died on Sunday at the University of California hospital at Irvine. She never regained consciousness after suffering a severe head injury in an automobile accident in Irvine early Saturday morning. She was 25.
        John Korff, a tennis promoter from Mahwah, N.J., said that Miss O'Reilly had been in California scouting sites for a balloon festival next year. He said she was the lone passenger in a car driven by Steven Allan Evans, 29, the pilot who had flown her over prospective sites. Mr. Evans was killed instantly when the car struck a utility pole.
        The youngest of identical triplets, Miss O'Reilly and her sisters, Patty and Terri, were celebrities in Ridgewood almost from the moments they were born on Jan. 18, 1968.
        Until injuries knocked her out for her senior season, Christine played No. 1 singles at Duke, compiling a 69-19 record.
        After graduating with degrees in economics, all three joined the women's tour, but never cracked the top 100. Christine and Terri left the tour last year to join Korff Enterprises.
        In addition to her sisters, Miss O'Reilly is survived by her parents, Eugene and Dolores O'Reilly, and three brothers, Gene, Brian and John.
