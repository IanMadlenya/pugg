        Patricia Schepps Vaill, a jewelry designer, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 74.
        Her daughter, Amanda Vaill Stewart, said the cause was complications of a stroke.
        Until she became ill in 1990, Mrs. Vaill was acting as a design consultant. She was known for her work in the Art Deco style in jewelry and the use of beach glass and rock crystal.
        Mrs. Vaill was the former president of Seaman Schepps, the Park Avenue jewelry design firm founded by her father in 1921. She took over after her father's death in 1972, retiring in 1988.
        In May 1986, Interview magazine published an article about her that was illustrated by Robert Mapplethorpe.
        She was born in San Francisco. She attended L'Ecole Mont-Choisi in Lausanne, Switzerland, and the Todhunter School in New York City, where she studied American History under Eleanor Roosevelt.
        Her marriage to John Arnold Vaill ended in divorce in 1975.
        Besides her daughter, Amanda, a writer in New York City, she is survived by a sister, Virginia Jane Scott of Cold Spring Harbor, L.I., and two grandchildren.
