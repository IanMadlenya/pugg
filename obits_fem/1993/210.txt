        Irma Lazarus, a patron and an advocate of the arts, died on Aug. 26 at her home in Cincinnati. She was 80.
        The cause was amyloidosis, a cancer-causing blood disorder, a family spokesman said.
        Mrs. Lazarus founded the Ohio Arts Council in 1965 and was its chairwoman from 1973 to 1975. She also served on the boards of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra, the Cincinnati Ballet, the Cincinnati Opera and the American Symphony Orchestra League.
        The opening concerts of the Cincinnati Symphony Orchestra and the Cincinnati Pops Orchestra seasons will be dedicated to her memory.
        For 35 years she appeared on television in an informal interview program called "Conversations With Irma," which was carried on Channel 48 in Cincinnati, one of the country's first public television stations.
        Her friends included leaders of the performing arts, particularly in the music world. She also was active as a fund raiser for AIDS-relief volunteers of Cincinnati.
        She was awarded the 1993 Ohio Arts Council's Governor's award for a half-century of leadership in the arts.
        Mrs. Lazarus, whose maiden name was Mendelsohn, was born in Brooklyn. She was graduated from Smith College in 1934.
        She is survived by her husband, Fred Lazarus 3d, and their three children: Fred 4th, of Baltimore; Eleanor, of Watertown, Mass., and Margaret Crawford of Rhinebeck, N.Y.; a sister, Eleanor Strauss of Cincinnati; and two children by her previous marriage, to George Rau: Elizabeth Bloch of Briarcliff Manor, N.Y., and George Rau Jr. of Crested Butte, Colo.
