        Peggy Dennis, a Communist organizer and author, died on Sept. 25 at the Jewish Home for the Aged in San Francisco. She was 84.
        The cause was complications from several strokes, said her son, Eugene Dennis Vrana.
        Ms. Dennis was the wife of Eugene Dennis, general secretary of the American Communist Party from 1946 to 1959 and one of 12 American Communists jailed in the late 1940's for violating the Smith Act by conspiring to overthrow the Government. Ms. Dennis worked mostly in internal party organizing and for many years served as a courier of messages to Communist leaders in Germany, Poland, France and other countries.
        After 1949, she worked primarily as a journalist at The Daily Worker and The People's World. She also wrote many freelance articles on politics and economics for socialist and liberal magazines including The Progressive and The Nation. She moved to San Francisco in 1961 after Mr. Dennis died.
        In 1977, a year after she resigned from the Communist Party because of differences with its leadership, she wrote a book based on her experiences as an organizer, "The Autobiography of an American Communist: A Personal View of a Political Life."
        A documentary about her life with Mr. Dennis, called "Love in the Cold War," was produced in 1991 by American Experience and Windfall Films and shown on public television in 1992.
        Ms. Dennis is survived by two sons, Mr. Vrana of San Francisco and Timur Timofeev of Moscow, and a niece, Laura Bock of San Francisco.
