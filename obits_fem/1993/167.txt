        Vivian E. Browne, a professor of art at Rutgers University and a painter whose work linked abstraction to nature, died on July 23 at her home in Manhattan. She was 64.
        The cause was bladder cancer, said her mother, Odessa Browne.
        Ms. Browne joined the Rutgers faculty at Newark in 1970 as an instructor in the art and design department. She headed the department from 1975 to 1978, becoming a full professor in 1985. She taught contemporary black and Hispanic art, painting and other courses.
        She was a founder of SoHo 20, a Broome Street gallery, established in 1973, that was one of the first women's art cooperatives in Manhattan. There she had several solo exhibitions, most recently in 1989, when she presented her oil and acrylic landscapes of towers and power lines superimposed on trees.
        Her paintings are in many private, corporate and public collections.
        Ms. Browne was born in Laurel, Fla. She graduated from Hunter College, earned a Master of Fine Arts degree, and studied for a time in Nigeria. Before joining Rutgers, she taught in high schools and colleges in New York and New Jersey.
        She is survived, in addition to her mother, by two sisters, Lenice Pannell and Yvonne Allison, of Wheaton, Md.
