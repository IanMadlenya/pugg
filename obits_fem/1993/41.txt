        Grace Hayward Mack, a horticulturalist known for her work in hybridizing chrysanthemums, died on Friday at her home in New Canaan, Conn. She was 91 years old.
        Her family said the cause of death was heart failure.
        Mrs. Mack became interested in hybridizing chrysanthemums as a hobby in the early 1950's. When she retired six years ago, she held patents on more than 35 varieties.
        In 1968, Mrs. Mack, together with Rachel Carson, the author of "Silent Spring," received the Garden Club of America Award of Merit in Horticulture, the highest such award given in this country. In 1989, she was awarded the Gold Medal Award by the Society of American Florists for her outstanding contributions to the floral Industry.
        She was born in Brooklyn and graduated from Vassar College in 1924. Interested in social work, she first worked with Indian communities in Alaska, then held an executive post at the Y.W.C.A. in Duluth, Minn. Later she joined the Katherine Gibbs School in New York City, becoming director of placement.
        She is survived by two sons, Talbot, of The Plains, Va., and John, of Washington; a daughter, Lucy, of Brookline, Mass., and six grandchildren.
