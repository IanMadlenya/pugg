        Janet Margolin, an actress with a string of roles in the 1960's and 70's, including parts in two Woody Allen movies, died on Friday at her home in Los Angeles. She was 50.
        The cause was ovarian cancer, a cousin, Ruth Malin, said.
        At 18, Ms. Margolin won her first professional role as the lead in "Daughter of Silence" on Broadway. But she was better known for her film and television parts, particularly as an emotionally disturbed teen-ager in the movie "David and Lisa" (1962) and as Woody Allen's girlfriend, Louise, in "Take the Money and Run" (1969).
        She also played one of Mr. Allen's former wives in "Annie Hall" (1977).
        Born in New York City, Ms. Margolin graduated from the High School of Performing Arts in 1961. She earned her role in "Daughter of Silence" that summer, after working for $9.65 a week building and painting scenery at the New York Shakespeare Festival.
        After "David and Lisa," which co-starred Keir Dullea, she went on to play roles in "The Greatest Story Ever Told" (1965); "The Saboteur, Code Name Morituri" with Marlon Brando and Yul Brynner (1965); "Enter Laughing" (1967); "Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell" (1968) and other movies.
        In 1979, she played opposite Roy Scheider in "Last Embrace," directed by Jonathan Demme. She most recently had a small role in "Ghostbusters II" (1989).
        She also appeared in several television shows and movies in the 1970's.
        She is survived by her husband, Ted Wass, an actor, and their two children, Julian and Tilly. She is also survived by three sisters, Emily Gwathmey and Barbara Strauch, both of Manhattan, and Laura Johnson of New Haven.
