        Ida Sciolino Antonucci, a retired senior executive and buyer of clothes for young women at Bloomingdale's department stores, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.
        The cause was a heart attack, her family said.
        Mrs. Antonucci, known professionally as Ida Sciolino, worked at Bloomingdale's for 30 years, retiring in 1980. Her expertise included bridal gowns, robes and lounge wear, and junior sportswear, dresses, coats and suits.
        Her responsibilities for the main store and eight branches included choosing colors, designs, fabrics and silhouettes. She oversaw budgets, advertising, display and the selection and training of young executives and new sales clerks.
        Working with designers and manufacturers, she selected and bought merchandise in this country, European nations, India and Hong Kong.
        She believed in American talent, and to find it she scoured ateliers, lofts and garages in the Village and Bowery where some designers had little shops of their own.
        A native of Buffalo, she graduated from D'Youville College there and took graduate courses in engineering and fabrics at the University of Buffalo. Before joining Bloomingdale's in 1950, she worked for five years as senior executive buyer of junior wear at Hengerer's Department Store in Buffalo.
        Mrs. Antonucci is survived by her husband, Anthony J.; a son, Peter A. of Manhattan; a sister, Marie Oberacker of Amherst, N.Y.; a brother, Anthony Sciolino of Buffalo, and one grandson.
