        Mary, Viscountess Rothermere, a philanthropist and socialite, died last Thursday at a hospital in West Palm Beach, Fla., at the age of 62. She had homes in Palm Beach, Manhattan, Monte Carlo and Newport, R.I.
        The cause was heart failure, her family said.
        She was a supporter of Save the Bay in Newport and an organizer of fund-raising events for many other charities. She had also served on the boards of Stratford Hall Plantation in Virginia and the Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif.
        A native of Dallas, she was a member of a prominent business family in Texas as the daughter of Kenneth Murchison. After attending Sweetbriar College, she married Ricard R. Ohrstrom, a financier and industrialist.
        After they divorced, she moved to England in 1966 and remarried, to Viscount Rothermere. He headed a British publishing empire that included The Daily Mail newspaper. After his death in 1978, she returned to the United States.
        She leaves six sons by Mr. Ohrstrom, Ricard Jr. of Greenwich, Conn.; Kenneth of McLean, Va.;, George of Berrville, Va.; Christopher of Strasbourg, France; Barnaby of Tampa, Fla., and Mark of London, all of whom retained the Ohrstrom name, and one son by the Viscount, Esmond Harmsworth of Cambridge, Mass. She is also survived by two sisters, Anne Smith of Boston and Jane Hamilton of Denver; a brother, Kenneth Murchison of Las Cruces, N.M., and several grandchildren.
