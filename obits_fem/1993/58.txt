        Mildred Collins, president of Mildred Collins Inc., a Manhattan-based sales promotion and publicity company, died on Sunday at Tisch Hospital at the New York University Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 69 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause of death was cancer, her family said.
        Before founding her business in 1969, Miss Collins was vice president of sales promotion for the Stern Brothers department store chain, a division of the Allied Stores Corporation.
        Miss Collins worked on a number of film promotions, among them "The Great Gatsby" in 1974, "Murder On the Orient Express" in 1974 and "Death on the Nile" in 1978.
        She was born in St. Petersburg, Fla., and graduated from Wesleyan College in 1945. She began work with the Rich's department store chain in Atlanta, and became the head of its radio school. In 1948, the Association of the Junior Leagues of America brought her to New York as coordinator of its radio and television program. She then joined Stern's, where she was one of Allied's first women executives.
        Miss Collins is survived by two sisters, Elsie Jenkins of St. Petersburg and Mary Collins of Manhattan, and several nieces and nephews.
