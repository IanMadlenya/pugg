        Julia Knickerbocker, a leader in the field of book publicity, died on Sunday at the Robert Janker Clinic in Bonn. She was 56 and lived in Manhattan.
        She died of heart failure after fighting cancer for two years, said her sister, Miranda de Kay.
        A longtime public relations executive in book publishing, Ms. Knickerbocker influenced a whole generation of young public relations executives who now hold significant positions in various houses. She was known for her elegance, wit and style.
        At her death, she was vice president and director of media relations at Bantam Books in New York. There she worked with authors such as Robert Pirsig, whose "Lila" (1991) became a major best seller.
        "She was that rare publicist equally adept at getting attention for literary, serious kiss-and-tell and pop entertainment novels," said Stuart Applebaum, vice president of publicity and public relations at Bantam Doubleday Dell.
        Much of her career was with Simon & Schuster, where she began in 1974 as a senior publicist and rose to be associate publisher. For more than a decade as director of publicity, she was the driving force behind all of Simon & Schuster's campaigns, working with such best-selling authors as Jackie Collins and Jane Fonda.
        She began her career at M. Evans & Company in 1967 and later headed the publicity department at William Morrow & Company.
        She was born in Paris, where her father, H. R. Knickerbocker, was a correspondent for United Press. She graduated from Radcliffe in 1958.
        Her marriage to Charles La Muniere ended in divorce.
        Besides her sister Mrs. de Kay, she is survived by another sister, Suzanne Colt, and two daughters, Noelle La Muniere McElroy Carter and Suzanne La Muniere, all of Manhattan.
