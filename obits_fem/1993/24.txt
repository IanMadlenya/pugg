        Jean Strachan Wilson, professor emeritus of history at Smith College, died Monday at Pennswood Village in Newtown, Pa. She was 89.
        She died of heart failure, said Prof. Elizabeth von Klemperer of Smith.
        A native of Duluth, Minn., Professor Wilson graduated from Smith in 1924 and earned a doctorate from the University of London in 1927. She joined the Smith faculty that year and taught there until her retirement in 1968.
        Professor Wilson was an authority on 17th-century England. In 1963 she was appointed the Sydenham Clark Parsons Professor of History. In 1969, after her retirement from Smith, she taught at the University of Iowa.
        There are no immediate survivors.
