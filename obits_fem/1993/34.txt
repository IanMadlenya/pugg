        Dorothy K. Willner, a sociologist who persuaded the United Nations to adopt guidelines protecting the rights of consumers, died on Saturday at the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in Manhattan. She was 73 and lived in Manhattan and Southampton, L.I.
        She had cancer of the small intestine, her husband, Sidney, said.
        Mrs. Willner served as the representative of the International Organization of Consumers Unions at the United Nations from 1974 to 1983. She campaigned for the voluntary guidelines, which were a statement of principles to assist governments, particularly those in developing countries, in establishing consumer protection policies. They were eventually adopted by a consensus of the General Assembly in 1985.
        "It was really a pioneering piece of work," Rhoda Karpatkin, president of Consumers Union, said of Mrs. Willner's efforts at the United Nations.
        She graduated from Bryn Mawr College and earned a doctorate in sociology at the University of Pennsylvania. She taught at the University of Maryland, George Washington University, New York University and Upsala College. She was a visiting scholar at Columbia University and also worked with several other organizations at the United Nations, including Unicef.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Karen Ferguson of Washington and Denise Pavia of Manhattan, and a grandson.
