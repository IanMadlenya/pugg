        Hortense Freezer Kobrin, who was a leader in charitable causes, died on Thursday while on vacation in Miami Beach. She was 87 and lived in Manhattan.
        Her family said heart failure was the cause of death.
        Mrs. Kobrin was a founder of the First Hebrew Day Nursery for orphans in Manhattan and of the Parents' Council of Ramaz School, a Jewish day school. For many years she served on the executive committee of Hadassah's New York chapter and held other offices in that organization.
        In recent years she pursued her interest in painting, specializing in abstract oils, and had a show last year in Stamford, Conn.
        Mrs. Kobrin was born in Manhattan. After graduating from Hunter College, she taught school for several years.
        She was married for 58 years to Irving Kobrin, a business executive, who died in 1990.
        Mrs. Kobrin is survived by three sons, Lawrence and Richard, both of Manhattan, and Jay, of Stamford and Sante Fe, N.M.; a sister, Thelma F. Diamond of Manhattan, and five grandchildren.
