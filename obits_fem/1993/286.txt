        Mary Agnes Kiernan Callahan, who devoted more than four decades to volunteer work, died yesterday at her home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan. She was 68 and also had homes in Hobe Sound, Fla., and Oyster Harbors, Mass.
        The cause was cancer, her family said.
        A native of Rye, N.Y., Mrs. Callahan was active in education, health care and the arts, in the United States and abroad. She was the first American trustee of the Holy Family Hospital in Bethlehem, Israel.
        She also was a Hospitaler for the American Association of the Knights and Dames of Malta, a Roman Catholic lay religious order.
        She was a founding board member of St. Gregory's School for Boys and was on Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's Commission for the Restoration of the Governor's Mansion in Albany. She recently founded the Malta Volunteer Services Program at the Cardinal Cooke Health Care Center in Manhattan.
        Mrs. Callahan's first husband, Peter D. Kiernan Jr., died in 1988.
        She is survived by her husband, Robert F. Callahan, whom she married last year; five sons, Peter D. 3d, of Harrison, N.Y., John S., of Pelham, N.Y., Gregory F., of Chappaqua, N.Y., Dr. Michael J., of Manhattan, and Stephen P. G., of Charlotte, Vt.; two daughters, Dr. Mary Carroll Kiernan of Arlington, Va., and Ann Madeleine Lewis of Loudonville, N.Y.; three sisters, Joan Malone of St. Petersburg, Fla., Macy Ann Beha of Rye, and Madeleine Halpin Bailey of Manhattan, and a brother, Myles Gilson Reilly of New Canaan, Conn.
