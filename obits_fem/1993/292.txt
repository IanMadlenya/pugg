        Nancy Lyman Roelker, a retired professor of European history at Boston University, died Saturday at her home in East Greenwich, R.I. She was 78.
        Dr. Roelker was best known for her work on 16th-century France. Her books included "The Paris of Henry of Navarre, as Seen by Pierre de l'Etoile" (1958), and "Queen of Navarre, Jeanne d'Albret 1529-1572" (1968). She also edited and translated French scholarly papers.
        Her last book, "One King, One Faith: The Parliament of Paris and the Reformations of the 16th Century," is scheduled for publication next year by the University of California Press, which placed it on its "centennial roster" of the 100 most distinguished books it has published since 1895.
        In 1985, Professor Roelker was awarded the Gold Medal of Paris for her contributions to the city's history.
        She was a Phi Beta Kappa graduate of Radcliffe College and received her master's and Ph.D. degrees from Harvard University. Her teaching career began at the Concord Academy in Massachusetts in 1937. She later taught at the Winsor School in Boston for 22 years, and in 1963 joined the faculty of Tufts University.
        Dr. Roelker came to Boston University as a full professor in 1971 and retired in 1980.
        She is survived by a sister, Helen Roelker Kessler of Cambridge, Mass., a nephew and three nieces.
