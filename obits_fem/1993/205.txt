        Rosamond Cross, a retired head of the Baldwin School in Bryn Mawr, Pa., died on Tuesday at the Waverly Heights retirement community in Gladwyne, Pa. She was 86.
        The cause appeared to be heart failure, said Barbara Minsker, the school's director of alumnae relations.
        Miss Cross became the headmistress of the girl's preparatory school, in the Philadelphia suburbs, in 1941, retiring in 1970.
        She graduated from Bryn Mawr College and taught history at Concord Academy in Massachusetts and the Lincoln School in Providence, R.I. She began her teaching career at the Baldwin School in 1937. She was also a trustee of Mount Holyoke College and had been an advocate for the physically disabled.
        Miss Cross is survived by two nieces and a nephew.
