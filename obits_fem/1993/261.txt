        Fran Carlon, an actress who worked in radio, television, films and theater, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 80.
        The cause was cancer, said her husband, Casey Allen.
        Miss Carlon began her career in the early 1930's, playing Little Eva in a touring company of "Uncle Tom's Cabin." She went on to Hollywood and acted in films with Loretta Young, Douglas Montgomery and the Ritz Brothers before turning to radio drama, appearing in shows like "Lorenzo Jones" and "Our Gal Sunday." She also played Lorelei Kilbourne on the radio show "Big Town."
        Her Broadway credits included "Sunrise at Campobello" and "Men of Distinction." On television, she played the title character on "Portia Faces Life" and was Julia Burke for six years on "As the World Turns."
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Kim Allen of Minneapolis; a son, Kerry Allen of New York City; a sister, Mary Behr, and two grandchildren.
