        Patricia Simon, a freelance writer who collaborated on a 1972 cookbook, "Simca's Cuisine," that won high praise from food critics, died on Friday at her home in Philadelphia. She was 59.
        The cause was arteriosclerotic cardiovascular disease, the Philadelphia Medical Examiner's office said.
        Ms. Simon collaborated with Simone Beck, known as Simca, on the 326-page book of menus and recipes from the repertory of Miss Beck, a respected French cook who died in 1991.
        Ms. Simon also wrote articles for Redbook, other magazines and The New York Times.
        She was born in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania, and graduated from Abington, Pa., High School.
        She is survived by her husband, Mike Sletson; a brother, Peter Angelo Simon of Brooklyn; two stepsons, Roy Aaron Sletson of Lebanon, Conn., and Jay Robert Sletson of Spring Mill, Pa., and a stepgrandson.
