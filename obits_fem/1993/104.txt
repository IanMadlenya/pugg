        Minnie L. Gentry, a stage and television actress, died at her home in Manhattan on Tuesday. She was 77.
        Ms. Gentry, whose given name was Minnie Lee Watson, was born in Norfolk and grew up in Cleveland, where she sang in church choirs and performed in operettas. Through Lloyd Gentry, whom she later married, she joined the Gilpin Players, one of the first acting companies at the Karamu Playhouse, in Cleveland, where she was a featured performer in dramatic, musical and operatic roles for 30 years.
        In 1946, Ms. Gentry came to New York and appeared in a Broadway production of "Lysistrata" with Sidney Poitier. She returned to the Karamu Playhouse three years later and performed there until 1961, when she came back to New York and appeared in "The Blacks" and "Amen Corner," among other plays. Plays With Racial Themes
        In the late 60's and early 70's, Ms. Gentry appeared in several plays that dealt with race relations, notably "Ain't Supposed to Die a Natural Death," "Black Girl," "Georgia, Georgia," and "The Gentleman Caller," one of the four plays in "A Black Quartet." She also appeared in "The Sunshine Boys," "All God's Chillun Got Wings" and in the title role of an Off-Broadway production of "Medea." In 1979, she won critical praise for her performance as Lena Younger in a revival of "Raisin in the Sun" at the Henry Street Settlement.
        Her many television roles included Aunt Bessie on the soap opera "All My Children" and, most recently, Gram Tee on "The Cosby Show."
        She appeared in small roles in movies, including "Come Back Charleston Blue" (1972), "The Brother From Another Planet" (1984) and "Jungle Fever" (1991).
        She is survived by a daughter, Marjorie Hawkins of Manhattan, three grandchildren, nine great-grandchildren, and three great-great-grandchildren.
