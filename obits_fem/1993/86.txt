        Tess Cogen, a lawyer, psychotherapist and college professor, died on Thursday at George Washington University Hospital in Washington. She was 88.
        The cause of death was Alzheimer's disease, her family said.
        She taught family life and sex education at Pace University for nine years before becoming professor emeritus.
        She was a consultant and co-author of a six-volume series on family life and sex education written for students in the fifth to ninth grades.
        She was a member of the citywide advisory council of the New York City Board of Education and a member of its curriculum committee on sex education.
        Born in Russia in 1904, Mrs. Cogen came to the United States in 1907. She earned a bachelor of laws degree from the Brooklyn Law School of St. Lawrence University in 1925. She practiced law in the late 1920's and early 1930's.
        In 1959 Mrs. Cogen graduated magna cum laude with a bachelor's degree in psychology from Hunter College, where she was a Phi Beta Kapa. Two years later, she received a master's degree in psychology from Columbia University's Teachers College.
        Surviving are her husband of 63 years, Charles Cogen; two sons, Joel, and Edward; four grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren.
