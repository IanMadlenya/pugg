        Jean Gould, who wrote biographies of Robert Frost, Edna St. Vincent Millay and Amy Lowell, as well as of the artist Winslow Homer, died on Monday at a nursing home in Perrysburg, Ohio. She was 83.
        The cause was cancer of the jaw, said her nephew, Dr. James Mann of Perrysburg.
        Miss Gould was born in Greenville, Ohio, and grew up in Toledo. She attended the University of Michigan, where Frost was one of her teachers. She received a bachelor's degree from the University of Toledo.
        In the early 1950's, after writing several literary biographies for young readers, she moved to New York City, where she lived until returning to Ohio last year. She did editorial work for the national education office of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers Union and for a time worked as a researcher for the National Opinion Research Center in Princeton, N.J.
        She continued to write juvenile biographies, notably "Young Mariner Melville" (1956) and "That Dunbar Boy" (1958), about the poet Paul Laurence Dunbar. Her first work for adults was "A Good Fight: The Story of F. D. R.'s Conquest of Polio" (1960).
        Miss Gould was best known for "Winslow Homer: A Portrait" (1962), "Robert Frost: The Aim Was Song" (1964), "The Poet and Her Book: A Biography of Edna St. Vincent Millay" (1969) and "Amy: The World of Amy Lowell and the Imagist Movement" (1976).
        Her 18 published books also included surveys of American playwrights and American female poets.
        Besides her nephew, she is survived by two brothers, Arthur, of Belfast, Me., and Bernard, of Ottawa.
