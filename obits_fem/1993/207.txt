        Nora Kildare Copeland, whose volunteer work for Catholic Charities spanned 25 years, died on Aug. 30 at her home in Sarasota, Fla. Her family said she was in her late 80's.
        Mrs. Copeland was a resident of Manhattan before she moved to Sarasota in 1977. She was born in Cygnet, Ohio. Early in her life she appeared in National Stage Productions on Broadway, and left the stage to marry Abbot J. Copeland.
        Her charity work was recognized by the Roman Catholic Church with an investiture at St. Patrick's Cathedral in 1982 where she was made a Lady Grand Cross, Equestrian Order of the Holy Sepulchre.
        In addition to her husband of 64 years, she is survived by two sons: Denis K. and Michael J.; nine grandchildren, and three great grandchildren.
