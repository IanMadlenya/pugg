        She was also involved in the promotion of international human rights and was recently named deputy director of the Orville H. Schell Jr. Center for International Human Rights at Yale. The center promotes research and assists lawyers and organizations concerned about preserving individual rights and freedoms and acts as a clearing house for information.
        She was the author of many articles and handbooks, including a three-part research guide on human rights law that was published by New York University.
        She was born in Birmingham, England. She received her bachelor's and master's degrees in law at Cambridge and a master's degree in library science at Columbia University in 1972.
        Her marriage to Stephen Elias ended in divorce.
        She is survived by a daughter, Megan Elias of San Rafael, Calif., and two sisters, Elizabeth Christenfeld of Poughkeepsie, N.Y., and Lucy Vincent-Daviss of Evesham, England.
