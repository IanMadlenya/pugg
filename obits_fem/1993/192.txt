        Charlotte Singer Morrell, co-founder of Morrell & Company, wine and liquor merchants in New York City, died on Thursday at Beth Israel North Hospital in Manhattan. She was 85 and lived in Manhattan and Palm Beach.
        The cause was cancer, her family said.
        She and her husband, Samuel, founded the business in 1948. They were then joined by their children, Roberta and Peter. When their parents retired, the children took over the business on Madison Avenue.
        In addition to her daughter and son, Mrs. Morrell is survived by four grandchildren.
