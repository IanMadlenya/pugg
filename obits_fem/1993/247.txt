        Gertrude Marie Derrick Bolden DePass, the first black administrator of a New York City welfare center in Harlem and a former deputy director of the city's Bureau of Public Assistance, died on Oct. 8 in a nursing home in Brooklyn. She was 86.
        The cause was complications from Alzheimer's disease, her family said.
        Mrs. DePass joined the Welfare Department in the early 1930's after graduating with honors from Hunter College. She was appointed director of the Harlem Welfare Center, which was at 1951 Park Avenue, in 1952, and in 1964 she was named deputy director of the Bureau of Public Assistance, a division of the Welfare Department, which later became the Human Resources Administration.
        Her first husband, Theodore Roosevelt Bolden, died in 1968.
        She is survived by her second husband, Hubert DePass of Orlando, Fla.; two daughters, Barbara Hurst and Jeanne Drysdale, both of Queens; two stepdaughters, Beverly Bressant of Orlando, Fla., and Claire Johnson of Queens; a stepson, Raymond DePass of Queens; nine grandchildren, 14 great-grandchildren, and one great-great-granddaughter.
