        Virginia Moore, a poet and biographer, died on Friday at Westmoreland, a nursing home affiliated with Lake Forest Hospital in Lake Forest, Ill. She was 89 and lived in Scottsville, Va.
        The cause was cancer, said her daughter-in-law, Betty-Ann Moore.
        Ms. Moore was born in Omaha. She earned a bachelor's degree in philosophy from Hollins College in Roanoke, Va., and a master's degree and a doctorate in philosophy from Columbia University. She began her career as a poet, publishing three volumes of lyric verse: "Not Poppy" (1926), "Sweet Water and Bitter" (1929), and "Homer's Golden Chain" (1937).
        She was on the board of the Jefferson-Madison Regional Library and the Scottsville Museum.
        She is survived by John Fitzallen Moore of Libertyville, Ill., a son by her first husband, the poet Louis Untermeyer; six grandchildren, and eight great-grandchildren.
