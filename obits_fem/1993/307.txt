        Uki Heineman, a retired importer who was active in liberal causes, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.
        The cause was scleroderma, her family said.
        She was a native of Indiana. She and her husband, Frank Heineman, founded the Manhattan importing firm of Menswear International in 1957. It became one of the early American traders doing business with the People's Republic of China. They sold it 20 years ago.
        Mrs. Heineman was a board member of the National Coalition Against Censorship and was a member of the President's Council at the New School for Social Research. She also was an active supporter of the Center for Constitutional Rights.
        Mr. Heineman died in 1981. Mrs. Heineman is survived by three daughters, Helen Heineman Haje and Laurie Heineman Millican, both of Manhattan, and Carol Heineman Staley of Fort Collins, Colo.; a sister, Della Mickoll Podell of Milwaukee, and four grandchildren.
