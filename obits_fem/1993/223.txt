        Lillian Ruth Kessler, founder of the Kessler International Corporation, which exports railroad parts, electronics and heavy industrial equipment to Asia, Africa and South America, died last Saturday at a nursing home in Washington. She was 85.
        Her daughter, Elinor Fuchs, said her mother had Alzheimer's disease.
        Ms. Kessler founded the company in 1946. It is now based in Rockville, Md.
        Before she established the business Ms. Kessler served for a year as an analyst for the Foreign Economic Administration, a Federal agency, conducting studies of postwar industrialization in Ethiopia and China. She then worked as an industrial economist for an international engineering firm and as a foreign markets consultant for the Sinclair Oil Corporation. W.P.A. History Project
        While still a doctoral student in economic history in what is now Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ms. Kessler was asked to direct a pilot history project for the Works Progress Administration, the New Deal program established in 1935 to provide employment through public works projects; eventually, the history project grew into the W.P.A.'s Historical Records Survey.
        Ms. Kessler was named the director of the project for Ohio in 1939. During her work with the W.P.A. she wrote a guidebook to American folk songs, "Songs of Yesterday: A Song Anthology of American Life," with Philip D. Jordan.
        She was born in Cleveland and attended Radcliffe College before enrolling at the Cleveland university, where she received an undergraduate degree in 1929.
        In 1930 she married Joseph Fuchs, the violinist, who was then with the Cleveland Orchestra. They divorced in 1940.
        Besides her daughter, Ms. Kessler is survived by a brother, Dr. Edwin S. Kessler of Washington, and two granddaughters.
