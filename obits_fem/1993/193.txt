        Elise Reiman, a longtime teacher at the School of American Ballet, died on Thursday at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. She was 79.
        The cause was an aneurysm, said Norman E. Kappler, her nephew. Miss Reiman, who lived in New York, was taken to the hospital after she became ill on vacation in Winthrop, Me.
        Miss Reiman, who was born in Terre Haute, Ind., studied with Adolph Bolm in San Francisco and danced in his 1928 production of "Apollon Musagete." She also studied at the School of American Ballet in its earliest years and danced with the American Ballet in 1935 and 1936 and with Ballet Society from 1946 to 1948. Both companies were forerunners of the New York City Ballet; like it, they were formed by George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein.
        Miss Reiman taught children's and beginning point classes from 1945 to 1953 and from 1964 through this summer. A keen-eyed teacher with a wry, deceptively lazy humor, she received the school's Mae L. Wien Award for distinguished service, in 1992.
        Miss Reiman performed in the original productions of Balanchine's "Four Temperaments" and "Divertimento."
        She was married to Charles W. Hotchkiss, who died in 1963. In addition to her nephew, she is survived by two stepsons, Frank Hotchkiss of Los Angeles and Charles Warner Hotchkiss 3d of Darien, Conn.
