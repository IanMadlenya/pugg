        Dr. Barbara Feitel, a clinical psychologist and research scientist associated with the Nathan Kline Research Institute, Phoenix House and Covenant House, died on Saturday at White Plains Memorial Hospital. She was 64 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was cancer, her family said.
        Dr. Feitel retired in April from the research institute, at Rockland County Psychiatric Center, in Orangeburg, N.Y., where she had worked for more than 10 years. She developed a program for the retraining of therapy aides, which was the subject of a film distributed by the New York State Department of Mental Health. She also organized a halfway house.
        For Covenant House in New York she researched the backgrounds of sexual abuse in the lives of runaway teen-agers. At Phoenix House, she developed interviews to determine whether young drug addicts had suffered severe abuse during childhood. She used the interviews to evaluate hundreds of youngsters at Phoenix House in New York and California.
        Dr. Feitel was born in Manhattan, graduated from Hunter College and earned master's and doctoral degrees in psychology at Columbia University's Teachers College. Before joining the Nathan Kline Institute, she was on the faculty of Albert Einstein College of Medicine.
        Dr. Feitel is survived by a daughter, Elizabeth Fieman of Denver; two sons, Thomas of Summit, N.J., and Charles of Manhattan; a sister, Patricia Leeds of Albuquerque, N.M., and six grandchildren.
