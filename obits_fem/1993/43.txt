        Constance Ford, an actress who appeared for 25 years in the role of Ada Hobson, an indestructably upbeat mother in the NBC daytime serial "Another World," died yesterday at New York Hospital. She was 69.
        The cause was cancer, said Murray Schapiro, her business manager.
        Ms. Ford was born in the Bronx and graduated from St. Barnabas Grammar and High School. Later, she attended Hunter College.
        She made her Broadway debut as the prostitute in the original 1949 production of Arthur Miller's "Death of a Salesman." Her other Broadway credits included "See the Jaguar" with James Dean, "Say Darling," "Golden Fleecing" and "Nobody Loves an Albatross" with Robert Preston.
        She also made many appearances on television. For her performances in "Another World," Ms. Ford was awarded a Certificate of Merit for Outstanding Contribution to Daytime Drama by the National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences.
        Ms. Ford appeared in a number of films, including "A Summer Place," "Home From the Hill," "Rome Adventure" and "The Caretakers."
        There are no survivors.
