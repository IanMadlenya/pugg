        Manya Davidson Novik, who was active in political campaigns in New York for more than 50 years, died on Thursday at her home in Manhattan. She was 87.
        The cause was cancer, her family said.
        In 1936 she solicited petitions to get Franklin D. Roosevelt on the ballot of the American Labor Party; in 1948 she was the radio coordinator for the Liberal Party during Harry S. Truman's campaign for the Presidency; in 1952 and 1956 she and her husband, Morris, conducted broadcast campaigns for the Liberal Party for the two Presidential campaigns of Adlai E. Stevenson, and most recently she aided the campaigns of Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by two sisters, Tecia Brill and Helcia Chaliapin, both of New York, and a brother, Morris Davidson of Miami.
