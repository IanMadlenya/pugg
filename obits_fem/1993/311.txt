        Dr. Mabel Satterlee Ingalls, a bacteriologist who was the last surviving grandchild of J. Pierpont Morgan, died on Tuesday at her apartment in Manhattan. She was 92.
        The cause was heart failure, said her daughter, Sandra van Heerden.
        For almost 30 years Dr. Ingalls was associated with a variety of medical and scientific groups, including the Columbia School of Public Health, where she was an adjunct associate professor from 1958 to 1964, and the Albany Medical School, where she taught bacteriology from 1936 to 1943.
        She also worked as a liaison officer between the World Health Organization and the United Nations, conducting surveys of health services in developing countries.
        Dr. Ingalls was a graduate of Barnard and Radcliffe Colleges and in 1937 received a doctorate in bacteriology and immunology from Columbia University.
        She was a fellow of the Pierpont Morgan Library, a life member of the Metropolitan Museum, and a founding board member of Goodwill Industries.
        In addition to Mrs. van Heerden of Manhattan, Dr. Ingalls is survived by three grandchildren.
