        Eren Ozker, an actress and a puppeteer with the Muppets, died on Thursday at her home in New York City. She was 44 and also kept a home in Los Angeles.
        The cause was cancer, said her husband, William Bogert.
        Ms. Ozker (pronounced Oscar) was born in Ankara, Turkey, and grew up in Farmington Hills, Mich. After receiving a bachelor's degree in drama from the University of Michigan in 1970, she moved to New York and performed in Off Broadway productions at the Roundabout Theater, the Public Theater and the New Dramatists Guild. In 1975 she joined the Hartman Theater Company in Stamford, Conn., where she took the role of Marya in the theater's first production, "The Government Inspector," and met her husband, also an actor.
        In 1976 Ms. Ozker joined the cast of "The Muppet Show," which was beginning its first season. She played the roles of Hilda, the wardrobe lady, and Wanda, an accident-prone vaudeville singer. She also performed in "The Muppet Movie" and "Emmett Otter's Jug Band Christmas," a television special produced by Jim Henson, the creator of the Muppets.
        In 1989, convinced that puppeteers required their own voice in the acting profession, she founded the Puppeteers Caucus, a working group within the Screen Actors Guild, and was its first chairwoman. In 1991, the guild presented her its Joseph C. Riley Award for outstanding service to the union.
        In 1988 she appeared for the last time as a puppeteer in "The Warrior Ant" at the Next Wave Festival in Brooklyn.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by four sisters: Denise, of Brooklyn; Peri, of Newtonville, Mass.; Shawn, of Bloomfield Hills, Mich., and Suzan, of Pompano Beach, Fla.
