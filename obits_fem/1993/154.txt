        Elinor Merrell, a decorator and dealer in antique textiles, died on Saturday at the Mary Manning Walsh Nursing Home in Manhattan. She was 98 and lived in Cross River, N.Y., and Manhattan.
        Her lawyer, Theodore R. Wagner, said the cause was complications from a stroke last October.
        For nearly 65 years, Miss Merrell operated her business, Elinor Merrell Antiques, in several different shops on the East Side of Manhattan and since 1981, from her apartment on East 78th Street. Amassing a major collection of museum-caliber textiles, she would sell swatches to fabric houses to copy.
        A specialist in 17th- and 18th-century French textiles, she served as consultant to the Metropolitan Museum of Art and to the Art Institute of Chicago. She also assisted in the development of the collections at the Cooper-Hewitt Institute of Fine Arts, the Winterthur Museum and Colonial Williamsburg.
        In 1954 Miss Merrell was a founder of the New York Winter Antiques Show, which developed a reputation for its top-quality art and decorative objects. She was a regular exhibitor at the show until 1990, when she and several other dealers pulled out over a dispute with the management.
        She was born in Cleveland, attended finishing school in Switzerland and graduated from Vassar College in 1917. Afflicted with polio as a girl, she had to use a cane most of her life.
        During a trip to Europe in the early 1920's, she discovered old French chintzes and toiles de Jouy (18th-century cotton prints) from a village near Versailles. She returned to New York and exhibited her antique textiles at the Anderson Galleries in 1925. Later she also developed an interest in French provincial furniture.
        She is survived by two nieces, Jane Jennison of Taftville, Vt., and Susan Faragoh of Castro Valley, Calif., and a nephew, Frank Faragoh of Knoxville, Tenn.
