        Maxine Flora Finsterwald, a playwright and short-story writer who used the pen name Maxine Wood, died on April 7 at Summit Hospital in Oakland, Calif. She was 87 years old.
        The cause was congestive heart failure after a long illness, said Jonathan Ezekiel, Miss Finsterwald's executor.
        Miss Finsterwald was best known as the author of the 1946 Broadway production "On Whitman Avenue," which dealt with racial discrimination in housing encountered by a black veteran of World War II. The play, which starred Canada Lee and Will Geer, ran for 148 performances.
        Miss Finsterwald was born in Marion, Wis., and grew up in Detroit. She graduated from Wellesley College in 1928, and studied drama at Carnegie Tech in Pittsburgh. Her published plays include "The Severed Cord" (1929), "Seven Against One" (1930) and "Sandals and Golden Heels" (1948).
        Miss Wood is survived by a sister, Miriam Moyer of Washington.
