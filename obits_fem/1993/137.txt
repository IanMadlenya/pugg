        Eileen Nic, a lobbyist on environmental and health issues and longtime consultant to Consumers Union, died on Monday at her home in Manhattan. She was 42.
        The cause was brain cancer, said Robbin Blaine, a colleague at Consumers Union, the nonprofit organization that publishes the magazine Consumer Reports.
        Ms. Nic was instrumental in persuading the United Nations to publish a directory of banned and restricted pesticides, chemicals and other consumer products. As representative of the International Organization of Consumers Unions at the United Nations, she organized over 300 groups around the world in a network to work for the banning of the hazardous products listed in the directory, which was published in 1983.
        She was co-author of a Consumers Union report in 1990 that named the eight biggest toxic polluters in the New York City area.
        Among other activities, she served as a consultant on hazardous substances for the Sierra Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council.
        A native of Philadelphia, she graduated from Temple University and received a master's degree in sociology from Columbia University. She began her career on the staff of the Philadelphia Department of Health.
        Surviving are her husband, Thierry Noyelle; her parents, Chester and Irene Nic, and a sister, Mary Ann Nic, all of Philadelphia.
