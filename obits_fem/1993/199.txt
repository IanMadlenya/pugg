        Louise Pierce Horwood, a retired public-health worker and civic leader, died on Thursday at a hospital in Hamilton, Ontario. She was 102 and lived in Cambridge, Mass.
        Mrs. Horwood was active in organizations at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, where she studied and where her husband, Murray, was a professor. She helped create M.I.T.'s first student residence for women in the late 1940's and was president of the Matrons Association, an organization of wives of faculty and administration members. She was also president of the Women's City Club of Boston.
        Mrs. Horwood was born in Chicago and reared in Europe, studying in France and Switzerland. She trained in biology and public health at M.I.T. In Boston she worked in a tuberculosis clinic and on a survey of the worldwide influenza epidemic of 1918. She later worked for the Oklahoma State Tuberculosis and Public Health Association.
        Her husband died in 1957.
        Survivors include a son, Sargent P., of Hamilton; two daughters, Louise Alden Cohen of Cambridge and Charlotte P. Armstrong of Manhattan; five grandchildren, and a great-granddaughter.
        Correction:  August 13, 1993, Friday
        An obituary on Wednesday about a retired public health worker who lived in Cambridge, Mass., gave her name incorrectly. She was Louise Peirce Horwood.
