        Beryl Emmer Menon, a journalist who edited the staff newspaper of Unicef, the United Nations relief organization, and who traveled and wrote widely in India and the Himalayas, died on Oct. 19 at her home in Manhattan. She was 50.
        She had decided to discontinue kidney dialysis after 19 years of treatment, friends said.
        Ms. Menon began her career as a freelance writer and photographer in Asia in the late 1960's after graduating with a journalism degree from New York University. She was a contributor to Ms. magazine, The Calcutta Statesman and The Bengali-American Reporter, taking assignments in Sikkim, Nepal and the Himalayan kingdom of Bhutan, which was then closed to outsiders by order of the Indian Government.
        Indian officials began proceedings to deport Ms. Menon from Calcutta because of her violation of the travel ban, but she was allowed to remain after she married Bhaskar P. Menon, then a columnist for The Calcutta Statesman.
        She returned to New York with her husband in 1970 and for the next three years worked as a reporter for The Record of Bergen County, N.J. In 1973, after learning she had kidney disease, she decided to travel again, to Turkey, Iran and Afghanistan.
        In 1986, she became editor of Staff News, which is distributed to Unicef's employees around the world. She served in this position until last year.
        She is survived by two brothers, William Kartel of Lake Ronkonkoma, L.I., and Ted Kartofsky of Manhattan, and a sister, Sandra Kartfel of San Francisco.
