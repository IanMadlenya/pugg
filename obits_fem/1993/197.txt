        Miriam Irene Eolis, a lawyer, accountant and theatrical producer, died Wednesday at St. Barnabas Hospital in the Bronx. She was 80.
        The cause was complications from a recent fall, her family said.
        She was a graduate of Hunter College and one of the first women to graduate from St. John's University School of Law. She also held a graduate degree in tax law from Columbia University and was a certified public accountant.
        Ms. Eolis was a tax consultant in private practice and served on the faculty of the New York University Tax Institute and Pace University. She also was treasurer and president of the New York State Society of Public Accountants.
        She had a lifelong interest in the theater and toured Europe with the Pegasus Players and was a producer of the Westchester County, Yonkers and Kennebunkport playhouses for 10 years.
        She was married to Alexander L. Eolis and, after his death, married Mortimer M. Kassell. They later divorced.
        She is survived by three daughters, Sharon and Wendeen of Manhattan, and Susan Kassell of Potomac, Md.
