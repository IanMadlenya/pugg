        Beatrice Tobey, a painter known for her covers for The New Yorker, died on June 19 at her home in Manhattan. She was in her mid-80's.
        The cause was Alzheimer's disease, said her son, David.
        Mrs. Tobey, whose original name was Beatrice Szanton, was born in New York City to parents who had emigrated from Vienna. While attending Evander Childs High School in the Bronx, she landed the part of an ingenue in a Broadway show. After the show closed, she went to Hollywood to pursue an acting career, but she returned to New York a year later.
        In 1928, she married one of her former high school classmates, Barney Tobey, a cartoonist whose work would appear regularly in The New Yorker for the next five decades, until his death in 1989.
        Mrs. Tobey attended the Art Students League, where she studied with Yasuo Kuniyoshi. She developed an Expressionist style, and her work was exhibited in galleries in New York. Between 1959 and 1969, she contributed 11 covers to The New Yorker, signed B. Szanton to distinguish them from the cartoons and covers of her husband, who signed his work B. Tobey.
        In addition to her son, who lives in Manhattan, she is survived by a daughter, Natasha Tubelskaya, of Rome.
