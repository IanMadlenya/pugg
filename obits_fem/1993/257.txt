        Audrey Triolo, an advocate for the elderly and poor in the Greenwich, Conn., area who directed a food bank and an organization that developed affordable housing, died on Oct. 14 at her home in Riverside, Conn. She was 60.
        The cause was cancer, her family said.
        From 1987 to 1992 Mrs. Triolo was director of the Food Bank of Lower Fairfield County, which supplied food to about 50 agencies in Greenwich, Stamford, Norwalk, Darien and New Canaan. From 1983 to 1986, she was executive director of the Greenwich Housing Coalition, a nonprofit organization that built low-cost housing.
        She had served in numerous humanitarian organizations since moving to the Greenwich area with her husband in 1967. In recognition of her volunteerism, Greenwich officials declared a day in her honor in the city on Sept. 20.
        Mrs. Triolo was born in Minneapolis and graduated cum laude from Smith College in 1954.
        She is survived by her husband, Peter; two sons, Stuart, of Seattle and Bruce, of Fort Collins, Colo.; two daughters, Ellen Uebele of Eden Prairie, Minn., and Leslie Franks of Portland, Ore., and six grandchildren.
