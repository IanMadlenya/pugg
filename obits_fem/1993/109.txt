        Alice Green Fredman, professor emeritus of English and comparative literature at Columbia University and an authority on the 18th- and 19th-century novel, died on Monday at Yale-New Haven Hospital. She was 68 and lived in Carmel, N.Y.
        Her husband, Irwin F. Fredman, said she had had a heart attack.
        Dr. Fredman began teaching English at Columbia in 1953 and became a full professor in 1972, retiring in 1991. While most of her career was in the School of General Studies, she also directed graduate studies in the English department from the late 1970's.
        She was the author of many articles and books, mainly on English novelists.  At her death, she was working on a critical biography of Mary Shelley.
        Her best-known book, "Diderot and Sterne" (Columbia University Press, 1955) won the Clarke F. Ansley Award by Columbia and was reprinted in 1973 by Farrar, Strauss & Giroux. Other books include "Anthony Trollope," published in 1971 by Columbia University Press in its Modern Writers Series.
        In 1962, she received a fellowship from The American Council of Learned Societies for postdoctoral research. Twice recently, she refused teaching awards, saying it would be better to encourage younger colleagues.
        She was born in New York City. A graduate of Swarthmore College, she earned a master's degree from Smith College and a Ph.D. from Columbia in 1953.
        Besides her husband, she is survived by two daughters, Lisa of Baltimore and Catherine of Manhattan, and a sister, Helen Neuburg of Princeton, N.J.
