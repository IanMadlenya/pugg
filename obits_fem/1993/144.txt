        May Davies Hopkins Martenet, a novelist and short-story writer, died on Sunday at the Westminster-Canterbury retirement home in Virginia Beach, Va., where she had lived since 1985. She was 85 and had been a longtime resident of Manhattan.
        The cause was complications stemming from lung cancer, said her son-in-law, William Van Orden Gnichtel.
        While living in New York, Mrs. Martenet wrote short fiction pieces, which were published in a variety of magazines, and a well-received novel, "Taw Jameson" (1953), which told of a ruthless game of social climbing in a Southern industrial town. A short story, "Father Delacroix," was included in a collection, "The Best American Short Stories."
        She was born in Newport News, Va., where her father was the president of the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company.
        Her husband of nearly 40 years, Edwin Martenet, died in 1972.
        She is survived by two grandsons.
