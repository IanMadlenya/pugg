        Jacqueline Shearer, a producer and director of documentary films about black Americans, died yesterday at her home in Cambridge, Mass. She was 46.
        The cause was colon cancer, said her brother Clement.
        Ms. Shearer's works included "A Minor Altercation" (1978), about the Boston school-busing crisis; "The Keys to the Kingdom" and "The Promised Land" (1989), which were in the civil-rights television series "Eyes on the Prize," and "The Colored 54th Regiment" (1991) for the PBS series "The American Experience."
        Ms. Shearer was born in Boston and graduated from Brandeis University. She helped found Boston Newsreel, a documentary company, and worked at WCBN radio and WCVB television in Boston.
        Besides her brother Clement, of Northfield, Minn., she is survived by her mother, Erline, of Boston; two sisters, Debbie, of Boston, and Linda Gossage, of San Francisco; and another brother, Charles, of Boston.
