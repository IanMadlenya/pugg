        Muriel Clara Bradbrook, a leading British authority on Shakespeare who taught at Girton College at Cambridge University, died on June 11 in Cambridge. She was 84 and lived there.
        Professor Bradbrook, who wrote as M. C. Bradbrook, was the first woman to become a professor of English at Cambridge. She held her professorship from 1965 to 1976 and was the Mistress of Girton from 1968 to 1976.
        She was known for her conviction that Shakespeare's writing was "the product of the economic, social and theatrical pressures of his time," as The Independent described it in reporting her death on Saturday. Her views were set out in her books "The Rise of the Common Player" (1962) and "Shakespeare the Craftsman" (1969).
        In the United States, Professor Bradbrook was in residence at the Folger Library, in Washington, and at the Huntington Library, in California, in 1958 and 1959; a visiting scholar at Kenyon College, in Ohio, in 1977, and an honorary member of the Modern Language Association of America.
        Several of her other books are in print in the United States.
