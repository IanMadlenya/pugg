        Jean Bodfish Brown, a civic leader in New York and Chicago, died on June 18 at her home in Chicago at the age of 52. The cause was cancer, her family said.
        Mrs. Brown was a founding member and chairwoman of the Friends of the Zoo, which worked with the New York Zoological Society to help renovate the Central Park Zoo and to foster environmental education in city schools.
        Later she helped found the Food Animal Concerns Trust, which advocates treating farm animals humanely. She was on the Woman's Board of the Art Institute of Chicago and was co-chairwoman of its centennial celebration.
        She was also the president of the Alliance Francaise de Chicago from 1990 to 1992. She helped revitalize the organization, open its new headquarters and expand its program of concerts, lectures and films.
        She was born in Chicago and grew up in Orinda, Calif. She was a graduate of Wellesley College. Her marriage to Joel B. Leff ended in divorce.
        Surviving are her husband of 17 years, Robert A. Brown; a son, Adam B. Leff of Los Angeles; a sister, Margaret Bodfish of Orinda, and three stepsons, Samuel Brown of Iron River, Mich., Robert Brown of Cordova, Alaska, and David Brown of Alta, Utah.
