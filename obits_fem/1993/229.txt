        Mary Grace Carpenter, a Connecticut schoolteacher who was an expert on the American Shakers, died on Saturday at the Greenery, a rehabilitation center in Hyannis, Mass. She was 74.
        Mrs. Carpenter had Parkinson's disease. She died after a fall, said her husband, Charles. She had been a resident of New Canaan, Conn., since 1951 and a summer resident of Nantucket since 1963.
        She lectured at museums on the Shakers and with her husband wrote extensively on Shaker furniture and other American decorative arts. Their jointly written books include "Tiffany Silver" (1978) and "The Decorative Arts and Crafts of Nantucket" (1987).
        She was born Mary Grace Winnett in Pittsburgh. She graduated from the University of Pittsburgh and received a master's degree from Bridgeport University.
        From 1963 to 1984 she taught in Center School in New Canaan, where she was assistant principal and head of the mathematics program.
        In 1990, Mrs. Carpenter's family established the Mary Grace Carpenter Award for Excellence in Elementary Teaching in the New Canaan school system.
        She was on the Visiting Committee of the Department of American Decorative Arts and Sculpture of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston.
        She is survived by her husband of 50 years, Charles; two daughters, Susan Curcio of Chatham, Mass., and Shelley Brown of Glen Ellen, Vt.; a son, Philip Atwood Carpenter of Chester, Vt.; a brother, Robert Winnett of Pittsburgh, and eight grandchildren.
