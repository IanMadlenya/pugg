        Julia Jones-Pugliese, who took up fencing as a New York University student in 1927 and five years later began a 60-year career as one the nation's premier coaches, died on Saturday after coaching Hunter College's men's team at a meet at St. John's.
        She was 84, and according to her family, she suffered a heart attack at Bloomingdale's in Manhattan.
        The first woman to coach a collegiate fencing team, Mrs. Jones-Pugliese led N.Y.U. to national championships in 1933 and 1938 and coached the Hunter team to a national title in 1970. She had been the Hunter coach since 1956.
        For Mrs. Jones-Pugliese, stature was athletic destiny. Deciding she was too short to join the N.Y.U. basketball team, she took up fencing and helped found the National Intercollegiate Women's Fencing Association. The association, whose membership grew from 4 to more than 70 colleges, conducts what is considered the oldest collegiate championship for women in any sport.
        Mrs. Jones-Pugliese's husband, Anthony Pugliese, a painter and sculptor, died in 1953. She is survived by a sister, Erma Stim of Plainview, L.I.; a daughter, Penelope Shaw, an instructor in modern dance and Yoga at Hunter; two sons, Patri, who teaches physics at Harvard, and Paul, a cartographer for Time magazine; six grandchildren, and one great grandson.
