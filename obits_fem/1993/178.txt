        Leona Dubnick, coordinator of the gifted-education program for the Huntington, L.I., public schools until her retirement in 1985, died on her 65th birthday Friday at the Williamsburg (Va.) Community Hospital. She lived in Huntington and Pound Ridge, N.Y., until moving to Williamsburg less than two years ago.
        The cause was cancer, her family said.
        A native of New York City, Mrs. Dubnick graduated from Brooklyn College, earned an M.A. at City College and studied for a doctorate at Teachers College of Columbia University. She joined the Huntington school system as a teacher and designed, developed and administered its gifted-education curriculum and program.
        In the late 1970's she also created and broadcast "Ask the Teacher" radio programs at the Long Island station WGSM and at WVOX in Westchester. From 1988 to 1991 she was public-relations director, news editor and writer at WPOB-FM in Plainview-Old Bethpage, L.I.
        Mrs. Dubnick is survived by her husband of 43 years, Dr. Lester Dubnick; her daughter, Monica L. Mowery of Scarsdale, N.Y., and a sister, Stella Monchick of West Palm Beach, Fla.
