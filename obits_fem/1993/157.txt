        Florence Turitz Bower, a music teacher for more than 60 years, who headed the voice department at the American Musical and Dramatic Academy in Manhattan, died on Wednesday at home in Newton, Mass. She was 94 and had moved to Newton from New York City recently.
        The cause was heart failure, said her son, Joseph, a professor in the Harvard School of Business Administration.
        Mrs. Bower joined the faculty of the academy as a voice teacher in 1964, the year it was founded. She soon became chairwoman of the voice department, a position she held until retiring in 1991. Her students ranged from classical recitalists and opera singers to musical theater performers.
        Before her work at the Academy, she was a member of the faculty of the Henry Street Settlement House and at the Dalcroze School of Music and taught many private pupils.
        She began studying music at an early age and graduated in 1919 from the Institute of Musical Art, which became the Juilliard School.
        For the next eight years, she pursued music studies in Paris, Berlin and Florence, where her teachers included Egon Petri, Yvette Guilbert and Bertha Fiering Tapper. When osteoarthritis prevented a career as a pianist, she became an apprentice to a throat surgeon in Paris to study the mechanism of the singing voice.
        Besides her son, Joseph L., survivors include a daughter, Ellen Feingold of Newton; five grandchildren, and three great-grandchildren.
