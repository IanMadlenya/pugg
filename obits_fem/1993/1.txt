        Chloethiel Woodard Smith, a Washington architect who worked on the urban renewal of Southwest Washington and the creation of the new town of Reston, Va., in the 1960's, died on Wednesday at her home in Washington. She was 82.
        She died of cancer, said Sydney Kasper, a spokesman for the family.
        Mrs. Smith had a variety of projects in Washington and in Syracuse and Rochester, N.Y. She handled both housing and commercial projects and was one of the first women to become well known in American architecture. She retired about five years ago.
        She was born in Peoria, Ill., and graduated from the University of Oregon. She earned her master's degree at Washington University in St. Louis.
        Mrs. Smith was the widow of Bromley K. Smith, who was a consultant to the National Security Council for many years. He died in 1987.
        She is survived by a son, Bromley Smith Jr. of Kenya, and a daughter, Suzanne Arias of Madrid.
