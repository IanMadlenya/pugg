        June Mellies Reno, a nationally known magazine writer about family and health issues, died on Thursday at the Linda Manor Nursing Home in Northampton, Mass. Mrs. Reno, who lived in Amherst, Mass., was 72.
        The cause was liver failure, said a daughter, Penny Robbins.
        Mrs. Reno was an alumna of Washington University in St. Louis and of the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism. From 1945 to 1970, she collaborated with her first husband as the freelance writing team of Jhan and June Robbins, whose articles appeared in Readers' Digest, McCall's, Redbook, Good Housekeeping and This Week.
        Her second husband, Earl Reno, died in 1975.
        She is survived by two daughters, Penny, of Haydenville, Mass., and Meg, of Northampton; two sons, Tom, of Brooklyn, and David, of Roxbury, Mass., and nine grandchildren.
