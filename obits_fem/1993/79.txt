        Lona Foote, a photographer known for her portraits of jazz musicians, died on Thursday at Beth Israel Hospital. She was 42.
        The cause was breast cancer, said a friend, Howard Mandel.
        Ms. Foote was born in New York, and she developed a special interest in the avant-garde. At ease with both musicians and dancers, she made her way around New York on her bicycle, photographing artistic activity at performance spaces from the Village Vanguard to P.S. 122.
        For the last 15 years, Ms. Foote worked at the Experimental Intermedia Foundation and also as a freelance photographer. Her work was published in The New York Times, The Village Voice, Downbeat and Ear. One of her last assignments was photographing artists for Arabesque Record's new jazz series. Among the jazz figures she photographed are Walter Davis Jr., Henry Threadgill, Lawrence (Butch) Morris, Abbey Lincoln and Marilyn Crispell.
        She is survived by two sisters, Naomi Kennis of Glendale, Ariz., and Regan Levin of Staten Island, and her parents, Ronald and Mona Foote of South Carolina.
