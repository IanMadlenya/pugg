        Eleanor Sanger, a television producer who won several Emmy awards for her work on Olympics broadcasts for ABC Sports, died yesterday at her home in West Tisbury, Mass. She was 63 and also lived in Vail, Colo.
        The cause of death was cancer of the uterus, said her son, Robert P. Riger of Manhattan.
        In 1973, Ms. Sanger became one of the first female producers in network television sports when she was hired by ABC to develop women's programs. Over the next decade, she produced dozens of programs for the network, including parts of Olympic broadcasts from Lake Placid, N.Y., in 1980 and Los Angeles in 1984.
        She left ABC in 1985 and moved to London, but continued working part-time for the network and also produced programs for other organizations. She was a member of several professional groups and also was an adjunct lecturer in the media arts department at the University of Arizona.
        Ms. Sanger was born Sept. 15, 1929, in Hong Kong and attended Smith College before earning a master's degree in public law and government at Columbia University. Before joining ABC Sports, she worked for several other television and news organizations.
        In addition to her son, she is survived by three other children, Christopher Riger of Myrtle Beach, S.C., Victoria Riger Phillips of New Orleans, and Charlotte Riger Hull of West Tisbury, Mass.; a sister, Helen Sanger of Manhattan, and three grandchildren.
        Correction:  March 9, 1993, Tuesday
        An obituary yesterday about Eleanor Sanger, a television producer who won Emmy awards for sports broadcasts, misidentified one of her residences. It was Vail, Ariz., not Colorado.
