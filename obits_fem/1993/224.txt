        Edith Meiser, a stage actress, writer and radio producer, died yesterday at Roosevelt Hospital. She was 95 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was a heart attack, said William Herz Jr., a friend.
        In a career that spanned half a century, Miss Meiser, a versatile performer with a satiric wit, appeared in more than 20 Broadway shows, including "Garrick Gaieties," "Sabrina Fair" and the 1960 production of "The Unsinkable Molly Brown."
        She was born in Detroit and graduated from Vassar College. She made her Broadway debut in "The New Way" in 1923 and went on to appear in "Fata Morgana" and "The Guardsman." Beginning in 1925, she appeared in three editions of the Theater Guild's "Garrick Gaieties," a hit musical revue that spoofed Broadway.
        Film audiences saw her in "The Middle of the Night," "It Grows on Trees" and "Queen For A Day," a trilogy based on stories by Dorothy Parker, Faith Baldwin and John Ashworth.
        She performed with the Marx Brothers on radio and wrote scripts for Helen Hayes's first radio serial, "The New Penny," and for the "Sherlock Holmes" series beginning in the 1930's.
        Miss Meiser also wrote mystery novels and a play, "The Wooden O."
        She was a member of the Actors Equity board of governors and the chairwoman of the Equity Library Theater.
