        Mary Bickford Paulsen, the mother of Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. of Connecticut, died in her sleep yesterday at the Governor's Residence in Hartford, his office announced. She was 88 years old.
        Mrs. Paulsen until recently lived in Manhattan. For many years she had been active in the American Red Cross, serving as an ambulance driver during World War II.
        Mrs. Paulsen was born in India to British parents, General and Mrs. Harold Bickford, and was a niece of the Most Rev. Randall Thomas Davidson, an Archbishop of Canterbury.
        Mrs. Paulsen is survived by three other children from her marriage to the late Lowell P. Weicker Sr., who died in 1979: Theodore M. Weicker of San Francisco; the Rev. Harold H. Weicker, also of San Francisco, and Mary Audrey Mellor of Scottsdale, Ariz. She is also survived by 13 grandchildren and five great-grandchildren from that marriage.
        Mrs. Paulsen's second husband, Howard C. Paulsen, died in 1959. She is also survived by three stepchildren from that marriage, Charles Paulsen of Marion, Mass., and Ann Reinhard and Lynn Leithe, both of Spokane, Wash.
