        Mary Lazar, the wife of the literary and talent agent Irving P. (Swifty) Lazar, died last Thursday in Beverly Hills, Calif. She was 60.
        She died of cancer, her family said.
        Mrs. Lazar was born in Aurora, Ill. She began her career as a model, and appeared in advertisements as a "Coca-Cola girl." She later headed her own television and motion picture production company, Juno Productions, and worked in the development department of Telepictures Productions. From 1988 to 1991 she was a West Coast editor for Simon & Schuster.
        In addition to her husband, with whom she shared homes in Beverly Hills, Manhattan and Southampton, L.I., she is survived by two sisters, Anita Rosenow of Boulder, Colo., and Holly Benfer of Norco, Calif.
