        Rita Karin, a stage, film and television actress who performed in both Yiddish and English, died on Friday at her home in Manhattan. She was 73.
        She had been ill with pneumonia, but no cause of death was listed on the death certificate, said her son, Dr. Michael Horowitz of Evanston, Ill.
        Ms. Karin was born in Vilna, Poland, in 1919. During World War II, she studied at the Moscow State Jewish Theater. Her parents and other relatives in Poland were killed in the Holocaust. In 1945, she left the Soviet Union for Germany, where she narrated "The Mills of Death," the first United States Information Agency documentary on the liberation of the concentration camps.
        In Germany, the American Government helped Ms. Karin and her husband, Norbert Horowitz, also a graduate of the Moscow State Jewish Theater, to create a Yiddish theater that performed for Holocaust survivors throughout Europe. Came to U.S. in 1949
        In 1949, Ms. Karin and her husband immigrated to the United States, where she began to act in the Yiddish theater in New York City. She was also well known for her readings of the work of Sholom Aleichem, delivered with other actors at the home of Bel Kaufman each year on the anniversary of the writer's death.
        In 1960, she made her Broadway debut in "The Wall"; the next year, she appeared in "A Call on Kuprin." In 1975, she was in "Yentl." Off Broadway, she appeared in "The Pocket Watch," "Scuba Duba," "The House of Blue Leaves" and "The World of Sholom Aleichem."
        Her film credits include "The Big Fix," "Enemies, a Love Story," "Sophie's Choice" and, most recently, "The Pickle." On television, she appeared in the 1989 sitcom "Chicken Soup," as the mother of the character played by Jackie Mason, and, this year, in the anthology series "TriBeCa."
        In addition to her son, Ms. Karin is survived by a daughter, Rochelle Axelrud of Woodmere, L.I.; four granddaughters, and one grandson.
