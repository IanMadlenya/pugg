        Katherine Judkins Clark, co-founder of the Historic Savannah Foundation in Georgia, died Thursday at a retirement home in Hilton Head Island, S.C. She was 95.
        The cause was cancer, her family said.
        Mrs. Clark, known as Kass, was the last survivor of seven women who founded the nonprofit organization in 1955. The group was jolted into action when Savannah's Old City Market gave way to a parking lot. Their immediate purpose was to spare Davenport House, one of Savannah's finest examples of Georgian architecture, a similar fate.
        Even before then, as a trustee of Savannah's Telfair Museum, Mrs. Clark led the campaign to restore her city's Owens-Thomas House, one of the country's great Regency buildings. She cajoled wealthy donors, architects and craftsmen to save the building, which is now a museum operated by the Telfair Academy of Arts and Sciences.
        Leopold Adler, a fellow Savannah preservationist, said Mrs. Clark became a driving force in the rescue of downtown Savannah. He said the restoration gave Savannah an economic boost by attracting throngs of tourists every year.
        A native of Danville, Va., Mrs. Clark graduated from Hollins College in 1917.
        Her husband of 47 years, Reuben Grove Clark, a banker, died in 1968. She is survived by three sons, Reuben G. Jr., of Charlottesville, Va., William J., of Pawley's Island, S.C., and the Rev. Holland B. Clark of Hilton Head; nine grandchildren and 18 great-grandchildren.
