        Katherine Hynes de Groot, an English-born theater and television actress, died on Saturday at the Englewood Hospital in Englewood, N.J. Ms. de Groot, who was 88, had been a resident of the Actors Fund Retirement Home in Englewood for the last six months.
        The cause of death was complications from a stroke, said her daughter, Fiona Rhodes of Laguna Beach, Calif.
        Ms. de Groot was born in a suburb of London and studied acting at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London and appeared in British productions beside John Gielgud, Ralph Richardson and Tyrone Guthrie.
        Her first performance in the United States was in "Lovers and Friends," with Katherine Cornell and Raymond Massey. Later, she appeared on Broadway in Bernard Shaw's "Apple Cart," with Maurice Evans; Sean O'Casey's "Red Roses for Me," with Kevin McCarthy, and "Point of No Return," with Henry Fonda.
        She also appeared on television in several dramas by Paddy Chayefsky, including "The Mother" and "The Catered Affair."
        After being selected by Moss Hart for the role of Mrs. Pearce, the housekeeper, in "My Fair Lady," she toured with the National Company in the United States and the Soviet Union from 1956 to 1962.
        In 1970, Ms. de Groot retired from acting to assist her husband, the food and wine expert Roy Andries de Groot, who died in 1983. The couple lived for many years in the Bleecker Gardens in Greenwich Village. Their first daughter, Christina, died of a heart ailment at the age of 26.
