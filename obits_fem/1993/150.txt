        Alice Magdol Conrad, who ran her own executive recruiting firm, Magdol & McCone, died on Wednesday at her country home in Bridgehampton, L.I. She was 52.
        Her family said the cause was cancer.
        Mrs. Magdol, who also lived in Manhattan, started her career as a copywriter at Seventeen magazine, moving to Adams Dana and Silverstein, an advertising agency in 1966. She subsequently joined Judy Wald Associates, a recruiting firm for the advertising industry, and then went to London where she founded that company's London office.
        In the early 1970's, Mrs. Conrad returned to New York where she joined Foote, Cone & Belding, the advertising agency.
        In 1979 she founded Magdol & McCone with Bonnie McCone. Mrs. McCone retired shortly after the firm was founded. It specialized in recruitment for advertising companies, including Grey, BBD& O, and Wells Rich & Greene, and for such financial institutions as Citibank.
        Mrs. Conrad was born in Manhattan. She attended Riverdale Country Day School, graduating in 1957. She graduated magna cum laude from Pembroke College in 1961.
        She was active in the Financial Women's Association and Women's Campaign Fund.
        She is survived by her huband, Richard; her son, David; her stepdaughter, Jordyn, and her mother, Bea, all of Manhattan, and two sisters, Caroline Anderson of Brooklyn Heights and Martha Hayes of San Francisco.
