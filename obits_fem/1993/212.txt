        Terry Morris, a magazine and short-story writer and past president of the American Society of Journalists and Authors, died yesterday at her home on Central Park South in Manhattan. She was 79.
        Mrs. Morris's career spanned three decades -- from 1945 to 1975 -- when she wrote dozens of articles for many of the country's leading magazines. In 1967 McCall's published an exclusive interview that she had with Stalin's daughter, Svetlana Alliluyeva, who had immigrated to the United States after burying her fiance's ashes in India.
        She also wrote several books, including a novel, "No Hiding Place," (Alfred A. Knopf, 1942), which told of Army wives in World War II, and "Prose by Professionals: The Inside Story of the Magazine Article Writer's Craft" (Doubleday, 1961), of which she was co-editor.
        She was born in New York City in 1914 and received a B.A. and an M.A. from Hunter College before teaching in the city's public high schools.
        She is survived by her husband, Eugene J. Morris, and their son, Richard.
