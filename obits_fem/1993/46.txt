        Enid Britten-Stux, who danced with the Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater, the Pennsylvania Ballet and the Ballet de Lyons, died on Jan. 22 at her home in Manhattan. She was 46.
        Her brother-in-law, Stefan Stux, said the cause of death was a brain hemorrhage.
        Ms. Britten was best known for her work in the mid-1970's with the Ailey company; she stood out for the emotional range of her dancing. Her repertory included the Eve figure in John Butler's "After Eden" and a doomed young lover in Talley Beatty's "Road of the Phoebe Snow," for which she was singled out for the understated, contained quality of her dancing and the driven physicality of the character's panic. She was also praised for her portrayal of Mahalia Jackson in "The Mooche," choreographed by Ailey.
        She is survived by her husband, Ivan Stux; her mother, Rosa Aytch of Philadelphia; two sisters, and a brother.
