        Adrianne Allen, a winsome British actress who appeared on Broadway in the 1930's, 40's and 50's, and also acted in films, died on Tuesday in Montreux, Switzerland. She was 86 years and lived outside Montreux.
        The British newspaper The Independent said she had suffered from cancer and other illnesses.
        Miss Allen, who specialized in light comedy, won critical praise as a neat, highly skilled performer who radiated intelligence. She retired from the stage in 1958.
        Her acting in the 1935 production of the comedy "Pride and Prejudice," at the Music Box, was praised for its adroitness. Big Moment on Broadway
        Her co-starring performance in the 1956 comedy "The Reluctant Debutante," as a busybody mother who tried to marry her daughter to an eligible suitor, was lauded by one critic as crisp, alert and highly enjoyable.
        In 1948, Miss Allen played a distraught wife and mother in "Edward, My Son." A scene in which she was bullied by her husband was called one of that year's big moments on Broadway.
        Her films ranged from "Loose Ends" (1930) to "Meet Mr. Malcolm" (1954).
        She was born in Manchester, England, and studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London. She made her debut on the London stage in 1926, in Noel Coward's "Easy Virtue," and on the New York stage in 1931, in "Cynara."
        She married the actor Raymond Massey in 1929; they were divorced in 1939. Later that year, she married William Dwight Whitney, a New York lawyer. He died in 1973.
        She is survived by her daughter, Anna, who performed with Miss Allen on the stage, and by a son, Daniel, who is also an actor.
