        Ruth Krauss, the author of "The Carrot Seed," "A Hole Is to Dig: A First Book of First Definitions" and other books for children, died on Saturday at her home in Westport, Conn. She was 91.
        Ms. Krauss was born in Baltimore, where she attended the Peabody Institute of Music. She received a bachelor's degree from the Parsons School of Fine and Applied Art in New York City.
        Her first book, "A Good Man and His Good Wife," with illustrations by the abstract painter Ad Reinhardt, was published in 1944. Over the next four decades, she wrote 34 more books for children, many of them illustrated by her husband, David Johnson Leisk, who wrote children's books under the pen name Crockett Johnson. He died in 1975. Eight of Ms. Krauss's books were illustrated by Maurice Sendak, beginning in 1952 with "A Hole Is to Dig."
        At a time when children's books tended to be didactic, with lots of text, Ms. Krauss pioneered the use of minimal text, concentrating on precise language and working closely with an illustrator.
        In addition to children's books, Ms. Krauss wrote verse plays and poetry for adults.
        She was awarded the Caldecott Medal for "The Happy Day" (1950) and "A Very Special House" (1954).
