        Joan S. Harrison, associate dean of studies at Sarah Lawrence College, died on Monday at Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. She was 59 and lived in Hastings-on-Hudson, N.Y.
        The cause was complications of lymphoma, her family said.
        A native of Orange, N.J., she graduated magna cum laude from Tufts University. She earned an M.A. degree in Arabic history from Harvard University, an M.S. in administration from Bank Street College and, in 1988, a Ph.D. in human development from Union Graduate School in Cincinnati.
        She came to Sarah Lawrence in 1973 as an assistant to the dean of studies. She was promoted to assistant dean the following year and to associate dean in 1980.
        Graduates and friends of the college's Center for Continuing Education endowed a scholarship in her name last November. In April she received the annual Carol Russett Award from the American Council on Education/National Identification Program for the Advancement of Women in Higher Education Administration.
        Dr. Harrison is survived by her husband, David; a son, Andy of Evanston, Ill.; a daughter, Rachel Harrison of Brooklyn; her parents, Rose and Harry Horowitz of Deerfield Beach, Fla., and a sister, Eleanor Dain of Kingston, R.I.
