        Liza Anne Bosworth, a partner in a Manhattan law firm, died on Oct. 18 in San Francisco, where she was on a business trip. She was 35 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was accidental drowning, her family said.
        A native of Manhattan, Ms. Bosworth graduated from Amherst College and, in 1983, from Columbia University Law School. She was admitted to the bar the following year, and joined the firm of Reboul, MacMurray, Hewitt, Maynard & Kristol in 1988 as an associate. She became a partner last year. She specialized in litigation in the firm's international practice.
        Ms. Bosworth is survived by her husband, Nicholas Pearson, a sculptor; two children, Lukas and Julia; her parents, Stanley Bosworth, headmaster of Saint Ann's School in Brooklyn Heights, and Anne Bosworth, head librarian of the school, which they jointly founded in 1965; a sister, Virginia Frisch of San Francisco, and a brother, Adam Bosworth of Seattle.
