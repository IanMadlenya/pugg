        Ann Osterhout Edison, a pharmacist and daughter-in-law of Thomas Alva Edison, died on Monday at the Caleb Hitchcock Health Center at Duncaster in Bloomfield, Conn. She was 91 and lived in West Orange, N.J.
        The cause of death was heart failure, said her niece, Sandy Karplus.
        Born in Oakland, Calif., Mrs. Edison was a 1935 pharmacy graduate of Rutgers University and earned a master's degree in public health at Columbia University in the 1950's.
        As a registered pharmacist, she worked at the Merck Institute for Therapeutic Research in Rahway, N.J., in the 1940's as well as in the laboratories of Thomas A. Edison Inc., which consolidated various businesses organized by her father-in-law, the inventor.
        Over many years she was associated with New Jersey Orthopedic Hospital and the Hospital Center of Orange, serving on boards and committees and heading several of them. She helped to establish the Child Guidance Clinic of the Oranges and Maplewood.
        Mrs. Edison's husband, Theodore M. Edison, died on Nov. 24. She is survived by a nephew and two nieces.
