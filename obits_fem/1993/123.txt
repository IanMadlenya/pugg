        Anne M. Johnson, a former vice president of Beginner Books, a children's book division of Random House, died on Sunday at her home in Clifton, N.J. She was 62.
        She had a brief illness, said Robert L. Bernstein, with whom she had worked at Random House.
        Mrs. Johnson, a native of Staten Island, graduated from Hunter College and briefly worked for Doubleday & Company before joining Random House in 1956 as a secretary. The following year she began to work with Mr. Bernstein. From 1966 she was the assistant to the chairman and president while Mr. Bernstein held those positions at Random House.
        At Beginner Books, she worked closely with Theodor S. Geisel, the star author for that imprint known as Dr. Seuss. She was a board member of the Dr. Seuss Foundation.
        Mrs. Johnson was the widow of Hugh Johnson, executive vice president of Hammond Publishing, who died in 1987.
