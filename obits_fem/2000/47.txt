        Nancy Binns Reed, a composer of musicals and operas, died on Saturday at her home in Burke, Va. She was 75. The cause was lung cancer, her family said.
        Mrs. Reed, who wrote some 250 compositions, ranging from songs to marches to operas, achieved her widest success with the 1953 pop song ''Oh, Happy Day,'' which she co-wrote with Don Howard Koplow. Mrs. Reed also wrote a musical, ''Tocqueville!'' in 1976 and ''The Blue Opera,'' a contemporary treatment of Orpheus and Eurydice.
        Her husband, Ogden Cartwright Reed, died in 1980. She is survived by a daughter, Amy Reed Geiger of Fairbanks, Alaska; three sons, Hayward C., of Spokane, Wash., Ogden Cartwright Reed Jr. of Philadelphia and Chris B., of Los Angeles.
