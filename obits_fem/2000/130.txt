        Ronne Wohl Wulwick, a founder of Hineni, an outreach group that encourages young Jews to reconnect to their heritage, died last Saturday at her home in Old Westbury, N.Y. She was 85.
        The cause was cancer, her family said.
        Mrs. Wulwick, a Bronx native who also lived in Palm Beach, Fla., helped establish Hineni in the early 1970's and remained an active member. The organization is based in the Hineni Heritage Center on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.
        Mrs. Wulwick was also involved in Fight for Sight, an organization that fosters vision research, and was active in groups for teenage suicide prevention. She helped raise money for Hadassah, the Anti-Defamation League and the United Jewish Appeal. She also helped start a fundraising campaign for Long Island Jewish Hospital in Hyde Park, N.Y.
        Mrs. Wulwick's first husband, Joseph S. Wohl, to whom she was married for 46 years, died in 1979. She is survived by Sam Wulwick, whom she married in 1988; three daughters, Elinor Wohl of Manhattan, Nancy Drake of Aspen, Colo., and Vicki Greenberg of Lawrence, N.Y.; a son, Larry W. Wohl of Manhattan; a brother, Jack Jaffess of Miami; and seven grandchildren.
