        Anna Berenson Mayer, a social work policy planner and retired professor of social policy at Rutgers University, died on Wednesday at a New Brunswick, N.J., hospital. She was 91 and lived in East Brunswick, N.J.
        Dr. Mayer, who received a doctorate in social work from Columbia University, was chosen in 1983 to head a newly formed Governor's Committee on Children's Services Planning for New Jersey. It was to make recommendations on children's issues to Gov. Thomas H. Kean.
        ''We have to make sure that every child in the state has a maximum opportunity for healthy development,'' she said in an interview later that year. One obstacle she saw was inadequate welfare benefits for the poor, which, she said, made it '' very difficult to provide adequate counseling to families and their children'' who lacked ''the basic needs of food, shelter, good health care.''
        She made similar observations when she delivered the panel's report to the State Legislature with the governor beside her.
        She was also known as one of two co-authors of a monograph, ''Day Care as a Social Instrument,'' written for the Ford Foundation in the early 1960's. The founders of Head Start used it to help shape their program, which began in 1965.
        She was born in New Orleans and taught at Columbia and New York Universities and then for a decade at the Rutgers Graduate School of Social Work.
        Surviving are her husband, Nathan; a son, Steven, of Albany, Calif.; two grandchildren; and two sisters, Ruth Forsyth of New Orleans and Florence Marx of Bogalusa, La.
