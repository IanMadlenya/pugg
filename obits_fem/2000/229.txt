        Irene Krone, who founded I. Krone Associates, a product-consulting firm, and co-founded Stop Traffic Offenses Program, or STOP, a traffic-safety advocacy group, died on Wednesday in a car crash while vacationing on Martinique. She was 60 and lived in Manhattan and East Hampton, N.Y.
        She and two companions died in the crash, The Associated Press reported. It said local authorities believed a 19-year-old driver had lost control on the rain-wet road and hit the car carrying her head-on.
        Mrs. Krone co-founded STOP in the early 80's, after one student at a Manhattan school was killed, and another badly hurt, when taxis ran red lights. She was for a time president of the group, which helped spur stricter enforcement of traffic rules.
        She retired in 1998 from I. Krone, which specialized in product design, including ergonomic designs for things like telephones. She founded it in 1979 after leaving the advertising agency Doyle Dane Bernbach, where she had risen to vice president for product development.
        At I. Krone, she took the part of consumer ombudsman, advising her clients, which included the makers of Atari home computers, Farberware cookware and Polaroid cameras, about female consumers' product and service requirements.
        She also worked for historic preservation in East Hampton village.
        A Queens native, Irene Beckmann Krone graduated from Chestnut Hill College in Philadelphia. She married Helmut Krone, a well-known advertising art director, in 1970. He died in 1996.
        Surviving is their daughter, Kathryn Krone of Manhattan.
