        Frances Mercer, a model who took up acting and went on to appear in films and on Broadway, radio and television, died on Nov. 12 in Los Angeles. She was 85.
        Born in New Rochelle, N.Y., on Oct. 21, 1915, Ms. Mercer began her modeling career while still a teenager and was a leading model in New York before making her film debut in 1938 in ''Vivacious Lady'' with Ginger Rogers and James Stewart.
        In her brief but busy career in Hollywood, she made nine films, including ''The Story of Vernon and Irene Castle'' with Rogers and Fred Astaire; ''The Mad Miss Manton'' with Barbara Stanwyck; ''Beauty for the Asking'' with Lucille Ball; and ''Society Lawyer'' with Walter Pidgeon.
        She returned to New York in 1939 to appear in the Broadway musical ''Very Warm for May,'' by Jerome Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II. Her second Broadway show was ''Something for the Boys'' (1943), starring Ethel Merman and written by Cole Porter and Herbert and Dorothy Fields.
        Television provided her with still another career change. Ms. Mercer appeared in the soap opera ''For Better or Worse'' and as a nurse in the syndicated medical series ''Dr. Hudson's Secret Journal,'' which ran from 1955 to 1957.
        Her three marriages ended in divorce. No immediate family members survive.
