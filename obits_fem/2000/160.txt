        Mary Colquhoun, a versatile, award-winning casting director, died on Sept. 10 in Manhattan. She was 61 and lived in Manhattan.
        The cause was ovarian cancer, said Carol Fineman, general press representative of the Joseph Papp Public Theater/New York Shakespeare Festival.
        Ms. Colquhoun (pronounced cull-HOON) received many honors, including the Casting Society of America's Hoyt Bowers Award for lifetime achievement. She was involved in more than 80 films, television productions and Broadway and Off Broadway plays.
        Her work won Emmy awards for two HBO television films: ''Citizen Cohn,'' about Roy Cohn, in 1993, and ''Truman'' in 1996.
        Ms. Colquhoun and Irene Lamb assembled what Variety called a ''top drawer'' cast for the film ''The Man who Cried,'' about a displaced Jewish girl from Russia. It was directed and written by Sally Potter and shown at the Venice Film Festival this month.
        Ms. Colquhoun, who was born in London, also handled casting for the movies ''Glory,'' ''Sea of Love'' and ''A Shock to the System.'' Among the Broadway plays in which she was involved were '' 'Night, Mother'' and ''Passion.''
        She is survived by a sister, Christina Burke; a brother, Patrick Burke; a niece, Tawny Wagner; and three nephews, Toby Wagner, Matthew Burke and Laurence Burke. All live in England.
