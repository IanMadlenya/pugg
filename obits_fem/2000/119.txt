        Christie R. Basham, a former executive producer of ''Meet the Press'' who was one of the first women to work as an executive in television network news, died on Sunday at her home in Washington, D.C. She was 68.
        The cause was brain cancer, The Associated Press reported.
        Mrs. Basham, a native New Yorker, graduated from Connecticut College and spent 19 years with NBC in Washington, beginning in 1957 as an aide to David Brinkley and advancing to director of news operations and other executive posts.
        After some years as an executive with CBS and then at WETA, a Public Broadcasting outlet in Washington, she returned to NBC in 1982 and went on to become assistant vice president for NBC News in Washington. She also held other executive posts besides being executive producer of ''Meet the Press.''
        Her husband, William R. Basham, died in 1986. Her survivors include a brother, a niece and a nephew.
