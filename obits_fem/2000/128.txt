        Grace M. S. McKittrick MacNeil, a civic worker and philanthropist who was the national president of Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. from 1969 to 1972, died on June 30 in Natchez, Miss. She was 92, lived in Natchez and had also lived in Princeton, N.J.
        Mrs. MacNeil was a longtime owner and operator of plantations in Mississippi and Louisiana.
        After holding paid and unpaid posts with Girl Scouts of the U.S.A., whose headquarters are in Manhattan, she was on its board of directors for some years and was elected national president after holding lesser executive posts in the 1960's.
        While she was president, she ''led the organization to its highest membership, of over 3.9 million members,'' Girl Scouts of the U.S.A. said in announcing her death. She also oversaw the beginning of a national Girl Scouts program of education about, and improvement of, the environment. Her philanthropies included giving more than 60 acres of land to help preserve a Natchez Indian historic site.
        She was born in Natchez and graduated from H. Sophie Newcomb College in New Orleans. Her husband, Douglas H. MacNeil, died in 1963.
        Her survivors include two daughters, Elizabeth Boggess and Anne MacNeil, both of Natchez; a grandson; and two great-grandchildren.
