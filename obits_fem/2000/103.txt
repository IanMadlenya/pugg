        Phyllis Propp Fowle, a New York lawyer who was the first woman to be an officer of the Army judge advocate general's corps, died Thursday in Manhattan. She was 92 and lived in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.
        She was also the only woman in the corps to serve overseas during World War II. Colonel Propp, as she was known to her former Army colleagues, was made a distinguished member of the corps at a banquet in her honor in April 1999 at the Judge Advocate General's School in Charlottesville, Va.
        A native of Laurel, Iowa, and a 1930 graduate of the University of Iowa, she earned her law degree there and was the only woman in the law school's class of 1933. She was working in the legal department of the Federal Land Bank in Omaha in 1942 when Congress opened the Army to women by creating the Women's Auxiliary Army Corps. She was in the first group to sign up.
        As a captain in 1942, she persuaded the Army to transfer her to the judge advocate general's corps. In January 1945 she reported to European Command headquarters in Paris.
        She rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel and processed hundreds of legal cases in Frankfurt and Heidelberg, Germany. One involved the Hessian crown jewels, purloined by three Army officers from Kronburg castle outside Frankfurt. Early in 1947, when the Army discharged all its women, it asked Colonel Propp to remain as the civilian chief of legal assistance, which she did until 1951.
        From then until the 1970's, while she was in private practice in Manhattan, she served as an advocate general in the Army Reserve, encouraging female law students to follow her path into the corps. She formally retired from practice two years ago.
        Mrs. Fowle is survived by her husband, Farnsworth Fowle, a retired New York Times reporter and former foreign correspondent, whom she married in Europe 49 years ago.
