        Linda Grey, a top publishing executive who rose from editorial assistant to president and publisher of the Ballantine Publishing Group, died on Aug. 30. She was 54 and lived in New York.
        The cause was complications from lung cancer, said Alan Davies, a  friend of Ms. Grey's.
        Ms. Grey resigned from her position at Ballantine last February during a reorganization of the company that came more than a year after the media conglomerate Bertelsmann moved to acquire Ballantine's parent, Random House.
        She got her start in publishing in 1970 as an editorial assistant at Coward McCann & Geoghegan. Later she rose to become managing editor there and then took executive positions at Dell Publishing Company, where she was its editor in chief. In 1981 she moved to Bantam Books as an editorial director and became its publisher and editor in chief in 1985.
        She left that position in 1992 to start her own short-lived imprint for the company, Linda Grey Books, which published just one book, ''It Doesn't Take a Hero: The Autobiography of General Norman H. Schwarzkopf.'' The imprint was dissolved the same year after the announcement that Ms. Grey was resigning to become president and publisher of the Ballantine Publishing Group.
        Throughout her career Ms. Grey worked with best-selling authors like Lee Iococca, General Schwarzkopf, Shirley MacLaine, Judith Krantz and Robert Ludlum and the suspense writers Michael Palmer and John Saul. Alberto Vitale, her longtime boss as the chief executive at Bantam Doubleday Dell and later Random House, often described Ms. Grey as a ''tremendously good editor.''
        After her resignation from the Ballantine Publishing Group, Ms. Grey, who was unmarried, essentially retired from the publishing industry,  although she continued to counsel  authors who were her close friends.
