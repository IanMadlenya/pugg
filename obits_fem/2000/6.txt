        Justice M. Dolores Denman, the first woman to serve as presiding judge in the Appellate Division of New York State Supreme Court, died on Jan. 17 at her second home in Naples, Fla. She was 68 and lived in Buffalo.
        After struggling with cancer for months, she announced in late December that she planned to step down from the bench.
        Justice Denman, a former Buffalo city judge and Erie County Court judge, was elected to State Supreme Court in 1976. The next year, Gov. Hugh L. Carey appointed her to the Appellate Division, Fourth Department, covering western New York.
        After an unsuccessful run for state attorney general in 1978, she was re-elected to State Supreme Court with bipartisan support in 1979 and was reappointed as an associate justice of the Appellate Division in 1981.
        Gov. Mario M. Cuomo named her presiding justice for the 22 western counties of the Fourth Department in 1991. She also served on the five-member administrative board of the state's Unified Court System.
        Mary Dolores Welch was born in Buffalo. She was a 1957 honors graduate in English and American studies at the University of Buffalo. She earned her law degree at its School of Law in 1965 and began her legal career that year in the Panama Canal Zone. She was an assistant prosecutor in Erie County before becoming a city judge in Buffalo in 1972.
        She is survived by her husband of 35 years, James Denman; two sons, Daniel Stanton of Ridgewood, N.J., and James L. Denman of Manhattan; a daughter, Diana Denman of Atlanta; a brother, Rupert Welch of Falls Church, Va.; and three grandchildren.
