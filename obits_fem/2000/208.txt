        Dr. Susana Rotker-Martinez, director of the Rutgers Center for Hemispheric Studies, was hit by a truck and fatally injured Monday while crossing a road in Piscataway, N.J. She was 46 and lived in Highland Park.
        Her husband, Dr. Tomas Eloy Martinez, a fellow faculty member and journalist, was treated for lesser injuries; she was pronounced dead later Monday evening at a nearby hospital.
        Dr. Rotker-Martinez joined the Rutgers faculty in 1991. At her death, she was also a professor in the department of Spanish and Portuguese and director of the university's graduate program in Spanish.
        Born in Venezuela, she was formerly a journalist and film critic in Caracas and an assistant professor at the University of Buenos Aires. She became a full professor this year.
        Dr. Rotker-Martinez wrote several books, both in Spanish and in English, as well as book chapters, articles, professional papers and reviews. She edited ''The Memoirs of Fray Servando Teresa de Mier,'' the life of a venturesome Mexican friar, issued in English in 1998 by Oxford University Press.
        A revised and updated version of her book ''The American Chronicles of Jose Marti: Journalism and Modernity in Spanish America'' was published this year by University Press of New England. She was preparing a collection of essays, ''Citizens of Fear,'' which is to be published in both English and Spanish.
        She was a 1975 graduate of Catholic University Andres Bello in Caracas. She received an M.A. in 1986 and a Ph.D. in Spanish-American literature in 1989 while working as a teaching assistant at the University of Maryland.
        Besides her husband, director of the Rutgers Latin American studies program, Dr. Rotker-Martinez's survivors include their daughter, Sol Ana Martinez, 14; her parents, David and Cecilia Rotker; and a brother, George Rotker, all of Caracas.
