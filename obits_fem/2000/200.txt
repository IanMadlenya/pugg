        Lucia Evangelista, a former soprano, a notable figure in New Jersey cultural circles and the wife of the renowned American bass Jerome Hines, died on Oct. 26 in North Plainfield, N.J. She was 83 and had been suffering from Lou Gehrig's disease.
        Ms. Evangelista was born in Genoa, Italy, on April 30, 1917. She studied voice at the Verdi Conservatory in her hometown and made her operatic debut at 19 as Mimi in ''La Boheme'' at the Teatro Politeama Genovese. After touring in Italy, she moved to the United States in 1947, then sang for two seasons with the New York City Opera.
        In 1952 she sang Violetta in a one-hour abridged version of ''La Traviata'' for the ''Opera Cameos'' television program, which was widely shown. That same year she married Mr. Hines, a leading bass at the Metropolitan Opera. They eventually settled in Scotch Plains, N.J.
        The couple made several concert tours together. After Ms. Evangelista retired from singing in 1957 to raise a family, she worked as an administrator and fund-raiser for arts organizations. She and Mr. Hines were co-founders of Opera Music Theater International, a training company for young singers. She also organized a series of benefits for the New Jersey State Opera, which were held at places like the Newark Museum and the Meadowlands.
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by four sons, John and Russell, of Scotch Plains; David, of Boston; and Andrew, of Macungie, Pa.; and by 12 grandchildren.
