        Luise Kraus Addiss, an art-loving New Yorker who was the first person to be a member of the Metropolitan Museum for 75 years, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 101.
        Mrs. Addiss was 99 when she set that record in 1999, the museum said. She received flowers and an invitation to lunch and a tour of the museum from Philippe de Montebello, its director, on a Monday, when it is closed. She was still a member when she died.
        She was born in Akron, Ohio, where her Austrian-born father ran a plumbing business. She became the first girl in her family to go to college, and she arrived in New York in 1922 to study for a master's degree in home economics at Columbia University. She joined the Metropolitan in 1924.
        Mrs. Addiss became a home economist at what is now the Community Service Society of New York and retired from the society after 40 years, when she was 65. Then she studied painting, was a consultant to the Head Start program for 10 years and then worked for Unicef for 10 years on projects like advocating breast feeding in developing countries.
        She married Edward F. Addiss, a Burlington Industries executive, when she was 29. He died in 1954.
        She is survived by two sons, James, of Manhattan, and Stephen, of Richmond; a daughter, Penelope Yungblut of Round Hill, Va.; five grandchildren and three great-grandchildren.
