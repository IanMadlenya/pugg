        Eleanor Naumburg Sanger, the first program director of WQXR, the classical music station that was later purchased by The New York Times Company, died on Saturday at her home in Manhattan. She was 100.
        Mrs. Sanger and her husband, Elliott M. Sanger, who helped found the station, assembled the music and interviews that turned WQXR, one of the country's first FM classical stations, into a New York institution. She came upon the job almost by accident: Called down to the station one day not long after it was founded in 1936 to help out with a deluge of mail, she stayed for 23 years.
        During more than 20 years as program director, Mrs. Sanger oversaw the staff that selected the symphonies and operas for each day's broadcast, published a program guide, hired announcers, and arranged for live radio performances by many great musicians, including Vladimir Horowitz and Van Cliburn.
        Mrs. Sanger was born on the Upper West Side of Manhattan on Sept. 20, 1900. She taught at the Ethical Culture Society School. Except for a brief period in Paris, she spent her entire life in Manhattan.
        She and her husband stayed on at WQXR long after the Times Company purchased it in 1944. Mrs. Sanger helped transform the station into an outlet for reporting breaking news to The Times's readers in New York between the paper's daily editions.
        Mrs. Sanger is survived by a son, Kenneth E. Sanger, of White Plains,  three grandchildren, and four great-grandsons.
