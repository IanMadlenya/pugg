        Eloise Jarvis McGraw, author of ''The Moorchild,'' a 1996 Newbery Honor book, and other novels for children, died on Thursday in Portland, Ore. She was 84 and lived in Oswego Lake, Ore.
        Mrs. McGraw began writing at the age of 8, shortly after her family moved from Houston, where she was born, to Oklahoma City.
        Her first novel, ''Sawdust in His Shoes,'' was published in 1950, and a steady stream of books for children and adults followed, including ''Moccasin Trail'' and ''The Golden Goblet,'' which were also Newbery Honor books.
        Another novel for young people, ''A Really Weird Summer,'' won an Edgar Award from the Mystery Writers of America.
        She was married for 59 years to William Corbin McGraw, who wrote for children as William Corbin. He died last year. For nearly 30 years the McGraws lived on a filbert farm in Oregon before retiring to Oswego Lake.
        Mrs. McGraw did the cover art for many of her books, including ''The Moorchild,'' a medieval fantasy.
        She is survived by her son and daughter, five grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.
