        Renee Orin, an actress and singer known for her roles in Broadway musicals, died on Sunday in Santa Monica, Calif. She was 73 and lived in Los Angeles.
        She had lymphoma, said her husband, Albert Hague, a Tony-winning composer of Broadway musicals.
        Ms. Orin made her Broadway debut in the 1955 musical ''Plain and Fancy,'' which her husband composed. Her Broadway credits also  include ''Finian's Rainbow.''
        She was called ''a singer with a lovely voice and a charming, ingratiating personality,'' by the jazz critic John S. Wilson in a 1976 review in The New York Times of a program of songs sung by her and her husband at the Ballroom nightclub.
        Born in Slatington, Pa., she received a bachelor's degree in drama from Carnegie Tech.
        Besides her husband, she is survived by a daughter, Janet Hague of Portland, Ore., and a son, Andrew Hague of Manhattan.
