        Rose Wyler, who wrote more than 50 books for children on science and other topics, died on June 12 at her home in Manhattan. She was 90.
        Ms. Wyler was the sole author of over two dozen books and a co-author of others. One of her best-known works is ''Spooky Tricks'' (1968), which she wrote with her husband Gerald Ames. When it was reissued in 1994, Scripps Howard News Service called it ''the perfect Halloween book'' for ''school-agers who are just beginning to read.''
        Ms. Wyler once recalled that as a girl she ''always had a collection of stones, bugs or leaves and always wanted to know more about nature.'' She never could find books on nature as a child, she said, so at 11 she decided she was going to write them.
        Her book ''Science Fun With Toy Boats and Planes'' (1986) was praised by The Christian Science Monitor, which said: ''For the young physicist, there is a wealth of information in this little book.''
        A native of the Bronx, Ms. Wyler  received a B.A. from Barnard and a master's from Teacher's College at Columbia. Her first marriage ended in divorce. She married Mr. Ames in 1948. He died in 1993.
        She is survived by two sons, Joseph Kosok of Vera Cruz, Mexico, and Karl Kosok of Silver Spring, Md.; a stepdaughter, Eva-Lee Baird of Manhattan; and seven grandchildren.
