        Margaret Connors Driscoll, the first woman to be chief judge of the Connecticut Juvenile Court, died on Tuesday at the Carolton Chronic and Convalescent Hospital in Fairfield, Conn. She was 85 and lived in Bridgeport, Conn.
        Judge Driscoll was named to the juvenile court in 1960 and was chief judge there from 1976 to 1978. An opponent of mandatory sentences and long confinement for juveniles, she was president of the National Council of Juvenile Court Judges in 1976 and 1977.
        From 1978 until she retired in 1985, she was a judge on the Connecticut Superior Court.
        In 1944, she was the Democratic candidate for Congress from Fairfield County. She was beaten by the Republican incumbent, Clare Boothe Luce.
        She was born and reared in Bridgeport and graduated in 1935 from Wellesley College. She received her law degree in 1938 from Yale Law School, one of five women in the class.
        Her husband of 48 years, John J. Driscoll, who was president of the Connecticut State Labor Council for 24 years, died in 1994.
        She is survived by a son, David, of Chevy Chase, Md.; a sister, Jerri Reilly of Fairfield; and a grandson.
