        Karen McCready, a print publisher, gallery owner and writer, died on Tuesday in Manhattan. She was 54 and had homes in Manhattan and Warwick, N.Y.
        The cause was colon cancer, said her husband, Jean Yves Noblet.
        Ms. McCready was born in Beaver Falls, Pa., and grew up in Dallas. In 1968 she graduated from Austin College in Sherman, Tex., with a degree in art and worked in the window design department of Neiman Marcus. Moving to New York in the early 1970's she joined Pace Editions, the print-publishing arm of the Pace Gallery (now PaceWildenstein) in 1972.
        In 1982 she became director of the New York branch of Crown Point Press, a San Francisco print publisher that has published prints by Wayne Thiebaud, John Cage, Pat Steir and Tom Marioni.
        In 1989 Ms. McCready married Mr. Noblet, a fine-art printer, and in 1995 she opened a gallery, Karen McCready Fine Arts, in half of his print studio, Noblet Serigraphie, in a large second-floor loft on West 13th Street in Greenwich Village.
        They often collaborated, inviting artists to make prints with Mr. Noblet. Ms. McCready would publish the prints and exhibit them in her gallery. The artists they worked with included Sandy Gellis, Julia Jacquette, Lorna Simpson and Georgia Marsh.
        An avid collector of ceramics, especially white porcelain, Ms. McCready was widely knowledgeable in many areas of the fine and applied arts. Her books included ''Porcelain Traditions and New Visions,'' written with Jan Axel (Watson-Guptil, 1981) and ''Art Deco and Modernist Ceramics'' (Thames and Hudson, 1995).
        In addition to her husband, she is survived by her brother, Robert McCready of Manhattan, and her mother, Ellen McCready of Dallas.
