        Marian Cowles Botsford, a former executive in the fabric-design and  women's wear fields, died on Dec. 27 at her home in Santa Fe. She was 79.
        She had a long illness, her family said.
        Mrs. Botsford was born in Buffalo to Edwin Cowles, an engineer and inventor, and Marian Tomkins Cowles. She was a great-granddaughter of an earlier Edwin Cowles,  who founded The Cleveland Leader newspaper.
        She graduated in 1937 from Chatham Hall, a boarding school in Chatham, Va., and in 1941 from Smith College. She became a designer and executive with Jack Lenor Larsen Inc., a Manhattan-based designer and manufacturer of fabrics for interior design, and an executive at B. H. Wragge, also in Manhattan, which made women's wear.
        She married Stephen B. Botsford, The New Yorker magazine's president from 1956 to 1961, in 1966. He died in 1967.
        She is survived by a son from an early marriage, James E. Mitchell of Philadelphia; a sister, Jeanne C. Fleischmann of Manhattan, who is the widow of Peter F. Fleischmann, a chairman of The New Yorker; and two grandchildren.
