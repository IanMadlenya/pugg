        Helen Ratnoff Plotz, who earned praise for compiling and editing almost a score of anthologies of poetry, mostly for young adults, died March 30 at her home in Brooklyn. She was 87.
        In a review of the anthology ''The Gift Outright: America and Her Poets'' (1977), Deborah Churchman wrote in The Christian Science Monitor that Mrs. Plotz was ''an outstanding collector of poems'' who included admirers and detractors in her compilation.
        Mrs. Plotz also compiled ''Untune the Sky: Poems of Music and the Dance'' (1957).
        Her 1981 anthology, ''Gladly Learn and Teach: Poems of the School Experience,'' was selected as an Ambassador of Honor Book by English-Speaking Union Books-Across-the-Sea. Her last anthology was ''A Week of Lullabies'' (1988).
        She was a member of the Children's Books Committee of the Child Study Association and of the Committee on Childhood Education of the Public Education Association.
        A native of Brooklyn, she graduated from Girls Commercial High School (now Prospect Heights High) and from Vassar College.
        She married Dr. Milton Plotz in 1933. He died in 1962.
        Surviving are two daughters, Elizabeth Wagman of Brooklyn and Sarah Jacobs of London; two sons, Paul, of Washington, and John, of Berkeley, Calif.; seven grandchildren; two great-grandchildren and a brother, Dr. Oscar Ratnoff of Cleveland.
