        Ann Roe Robbins, a teacher of cooking who, along with James A. Beard and other food writers, helped to convince Americans of the 1960's that cooking could be an art form, died June 25 at her home in Manhattan. She was 94.
        In 1960, Craig Claiborne, the New York Times food critic, heaped praise on Mrs. Robbins's private cooking school and the one run by Mr. Beard as the most important such schools in the city.
        Mrs. Robbins's popular classes were held in the large kitchen of her apartment overlooking Central Park West. She specialized in international cuisine.
        Mrs. Robbins also wrote about a dozen cookbooks, including ''25 Vegetables Anyone Can Grow'' (Crowell, 1942) and ''How to Cook Well'' (Crowell, 1946), and she collaborated on ''The Dione Lucas Meat and Poultry Cook Book'' (Little Brown, 1955). An anonymous reviewer for The New York Times said of the meat and poultry book: ''This probably is the cookbook of the year.''
        Mrs. Robbins was born on Sept. 14, 1905, in Newark. She graduated from Smith College in 1926, and when she married a few years later, she told an interviewer, she could ''hardly make a meat loaf.''
        But she learned. When asked for advice on how to learn to cook, she said: ''By going into the kitchen and pitching in. Get a good basic cookbook and let it be your guide. I learned by experience. I still think it the best teacher.''
        She is survived by three daughters, Jennifer Manocherian of Scarsdale, N.Y., Susan Morrison of Hingham., Mass., and Victoria Cowal of Mexico City; 11 grandchildren; and 14 great-grandchildren.
