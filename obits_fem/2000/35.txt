        Jane Nickerson Steinberg, a former food editor of The New York Times, died Sunday at a hospital in White Sulphur Springs, Mont. She was 83.
        The cause was Alzheimer's disease, said a son, John R. Steinberg.
        As Jane Nickerson, she was food editor of The Times from 1942 to 1957, when she moved to Lakeland, Fla. She was food editor of The Ledger in Lakeland from 1973 to 1988, her son said. In 1973, she published ''Jane Nickerson's Florida Cookbook.''
        Mrs. Steinberg was born on May 19, 1916, in Manhattan. She worked for The Saturday Evening Post and Ladies Home Journal before joining The Times.
        Her marriage to Alexander Francis Steinberg ended in divorce in 1972. Besides their son John, of Lakeland, she is survived by their two other sons, Josiah Bartlett Steinberg of Lakeland and Marc Steinberg of White Sulphur Springs; their daughter, Alexandra Kaghan Macaluso of Reston, Va.; and four grandchildren.
