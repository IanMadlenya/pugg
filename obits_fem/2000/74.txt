        Evelyn Swarthout Hayes, a former concert pianist, educator and arts patron, died on March 24 at George Washington University Hospital. She was 87 and lived in Washington.
        Mrs. Hayes, who was born Evelyn Swarthout in Jacksonville, Ill., began her music career in the 1930's, appearing several times in recitals at Town Hall in New York. In 1939 she married Patrick Hayes, a music administrator. The couple moved to Washington when he was appointed manager of the National Symphony Orchestra.
        Mrs. Hayes joined the piano faculty at American University in 1951 and taught there until retiring in 1976. She also continued to perform, giving recitals at the National Gallery and elsewhere, and she created ''Music in Schools,'' an educational radio program for young listeners.
        She served as a judge in many piano competitions as well as giving lectures and master classes around the country.
        Her husband, who founded the Hayes Concert Bureau -- later renamed the Washington Performing Arts Society -- died in 1998. She is survived by a son, Bryant, of New York; a daughter, Elisabeth Hayes of Chicago; a grandchild; two step-grandchildren and two step-great-grandchildren.
