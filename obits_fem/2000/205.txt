        Rosalind Baker Wilson, an editor and writer who published a memoir of her father, Edmund Wilson, one of America's foremost men of letters, died on Oct. 30 in Syracuse. She was 79 and lived in Talcottville, N.Y.
        The cause was a cerebral hemorrhage, said Tim Page, a friend.
        Ms. Wilson was the author of ''Near the Magician: A Memoir of My Father, Edmund Wilson'' (Weidenfeld, 1990). She also published short stories and served as an editor at The New Yorker and Houghton Mifflin, the publisher.
        A native New Yorker, Ms. Wilson attended Bennington College and Columbia University and started her career in the 1940's. In the 1960's she moved to Talcottville, the Black River family seat Edmund Wilson memorialized in ''Upstate'' (1970).
        She was Wilson's elder daughter, by the first of his four wives, Mary Blair.
        She is survived by a stepbrother, Reuell Kimball Wilson of London, Ont.; and a stepsister, Helen Miranda Wilson of Wellfleet, Mass.
        Correction:  November 11, 2000, Saturday  An obituary of the writer and editor Rosalind Baker Wilson on Thursday misstated her relationship to two survivors. Reuel Wilson of London, Ontario, was her half brother and Helen Miranda Wilson of Wellfleet, Mass., her half sister -- not stepbrother and stepsister.
        Correction:  January 8, 2001, Monday  An obituary on Nov. 9 about Rosalind Baker Wilson, a writer and daughter of the critic Edmund Wilson, misstated her age. She was 77, not 79. This correction was delayed by an editing lapse.
