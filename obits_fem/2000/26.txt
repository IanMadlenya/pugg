        Suzanne Gallo, a designer who created costumes for many of Merce Cunningham's major recent works, died on Feb. 19 at her home in Manhattan. She was 46.
        The cause was cancer, said David Vaughan, the archivist for the Merce Cunningham Dance Company.
        In a relatively short career in design, Ms. Gallo became known for handsome, sometimes luminously pretty costumes that allowed the body to move and captured the often intangible qualities of Mr. Cunningham's dances without intruding on the choreography itself. Robert Greskovic, writing in The Wall Street Journal last year about Ms. Gallo's costumes for Mr. Cunningham's ''Pond Way,'' described her work as ''consistently inspired.''
        Born in Brooklyn, Ms. Gallo received a bachelor's degree in theater and textiles from the State University of New York. She joined the Cunningham company as a wardrobe superviser in 1982 and worked as a costume builder -- constructing the costumes from the designs -- before creating her first design for Mr. Cunningham in 1993. Among the Cunningham works for which she designed costumes were ''Ground Level Overlay,'' ''Windows'' and ''Biped.''
        Ms. Gallo also worked as a costume builder or designer with such choreographers as Neil Greenberg, Meredith Monk, Lucinda Childs and Trisha Brown and with companies like the White Oak Dance Project, Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater and Ballet Hispanico.
        She is survived by her parents, Frank and Joan Gallo of Lakewood,  N.J., and three brothers, Steven, of Lindenhurst, N.Y., Anthony, of Levittown, N.Y., and Philip, of Manhattan.
