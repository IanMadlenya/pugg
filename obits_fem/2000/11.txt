        Zilla Lippmann, a philanthropist and past president of New Dramatists, a Manhattan-based theatrical organization that helps playwrights develop new works, died on Dec. 27 at her home in Manhattan. She was 95.
        Mrs. Lippmann, a niece of the Broadway producer John Golden, first worked in his office as a script evaluator and, eventually, producing associate. She was a founder and president of the John Golden Fund, a foundation devoted to the support of American plays and playwriting. She also played a major role in founding New Dramatists in 1949, served for many years on its board and was its president in the early 1980's.
        The John Golden Fund later helped New Dramatists buy its headquarters at 242 West 44th Street, and Mrs. Lippmann instigated the creation of dormitory space in the building for visiting playwrights.
        In the 1980's Mrs. Lippmann developed the New Dramatists' international playwright exchange program, which was renamed the Brooks Atkinson Memorial Playwright Exchange in honor of the former theater critic of The New York Times. The program is currently underwritten by the New York Times Company Foundation.
        Mrs. Lippmann was also on the board of the Museum of the City of New York and helped found and develop its theater collection.
        Born Zilla Hymes in New York, Mrs. Lippmann studied biology at Vassar College and graduated from Cooper Union with a degree in chemical engineering. She married Alfred Lippmann, an advertising executive, in 1929.
        She is survived by a daughter, Jill Allgauer of Munich, and three grandchildren.
